        "question": "i feel like i need to work on a big project but can't figure out what. i can also create a lot of things like videos, 2d/3d/art/animation, music, etc. and have been releasing it, but i want a bigger audience. i want to create my own 'history of japan' and i mean that as an example of a big project to work on where i can demonstrate my abilities and finally get noticed. how did you figure out that was what you needed to do?",
        "answer": "my strategy for 'getting noticed' was not to do a huge video first. instead i started by making much smaller videos very quickly, and flooding my website with them, as well as some other sites. after about a year, it started to catch on a little, and then about 6 months later when the audience was much larger, i decided to take the risk and make something much longer. by that time i had much better skills, much more focused procedures, and a large audience. those elements combined made the video release a success"

        "question": "What are some cool ways you can substitute an 11th chord into a progression? I get you can incorporate them however you want into your own writing... but what about when playing with others? For example, if the chart of a song has a IV chord, would a I11 chord work over the IV in most situations? If you throw a major 6th into a I11 chord, that would esssentially make it a IVmaj9.",
        "answer": "i would recommend focusing on the melody where i come from, \"11\" usually only is used on minor chords. i don't quite see how your example adds up. in C assuming you mean 1,3,5,7,9,11 (which mostly no one would do, i'm not sure if you meant#11? or is it a minor chord all along?) and then you add a 6, that doesn't really make Fmaj9. anyway, it's not too good to think about it this way. just use the notes you need to support the melody, then afterwards you can argue about what to put on the page. Sounds like you are a bit goal oriented on using the number 11 on the page, and that might not be a good way to look at it. A useful example of something that might end up being called \"11\" is let's say it's the key of C, melody note is G, and it's a Dmin7 chord. in reality you might play C,F,G(notes) in the chord, and call it Dmin11 if you want. Or let's say you are in the key of Cmin and it's just a Cmin vamp for a while and you've got a melody that is focusing on the F note. then you might use F,D,Bb notes in your chord, with the Eb tucked in there too. or more likely even, oscilating between a Bb triad and Eb triad in the chord. similarly in the relative major version of that, in the key of Eb, you might see a F note on a Cmin chord, and the chordal player will play Bb triad (over C) first, before swicthing to the Eb triad (Cmin7). all these things might be called 11. but to be honest it's not too necessary to really use the number 11 when talking about chords, it's kind of confusing, and the way it's taught as a stack of 3rds up to 11 is a bit confusing and does not really represent most musical realities. because a full stack up to 11 would have 6 notes, and most chords have less than 6 notes, so most chords being called '11' wont really have all the notes. also stacking it from the bottom up is not something that normally happens in reality outside of a music textbook or class. usually when you see 11 on the page it just means that the melody note is a 4th above the bass. and the remaining notes are chosen sensibly for the situation. i hope that makes sense"

        "question": "hi Sam! quick question. you talked in one of the earlier questions about using a sophisticated hierarchical randomness in your method to produce your work, like using somewhere a random number generator to choose what to do. could you explain it in more detail (how the hierarchy works), and why you needed this to be productive for yourself?",
        "answer": "that's not my name but whatever i've used it for different things, and it works differently depending on what i'm using it for. but the main reason i use it is to help make decisions when i know that any decision would be right. one of the most important things i've learned is you can really make something out of anything. this is one of the most important things that i've realized, and it applies to songwriting, making videos, anything. and it's great news to realize this, but if you are also responsible for choosing what thing to do, it often undermines your confidence. think of it this way: the great news is you can make any piece of trash into something great. sounds exciting, right? but what if you're allowed to choose which piece of trash to use? you won't be able to think clearly. because part of the reason it works is because you know you have to be stuck with that thing, and you have to figure out how to make it good. if you're allowed to choose what thing to start with then you're just going to constantly question if you're working on the right thing and you're going to get cold feet on every project immediately because you're not sure if it's the right project, and you won't have any brain power left to actually figure out what to do on the project because you will be busy second guessing whether it's the right project. so that's why it helps to get all your choices into a list and make a firm plan to do whatever project is decided by the randomizer. one of the main places i've used this is when picking what songs to record. i've written hundreds of songs throughout the years, and there are so many left to be recorded. so usually when i put out a song i pick from this list. every song has tiny reasons why i think \"oh that's the wrong song for right now\" but if you have that attitude you're never going to be comfortable picking a song. i always try to 'actually choose the right one' but my confidence in the decision collapses every time, and i have to randomize. as a result i have recorded some songs that i probably never would have chosen otherwise, but i was able to make them into something good because i wasn't questioning the entire decision while trying to make the thing. i think a lot of artists use randomization in various ways when they feel there are too many choices. i also often get a random word suggestion as a starting point for writing tweets"

        "question": "This analysis of your latest video was posted in the comment section by shredup chopel, what do you think of it? Is it close to the idea you had in mind when writing the video? Analysis: Part 1: play by play The video opens up with our protagonist \"Steve\" introducing himself. The very next thing he tells us is that he drives a car thats stuck in a tree. He then goes on to admit he was lying and that his real name isn't steve. he then says that he's filing for an extension on his taxes because he didn't pay them but in the same sentence says doesn't plan to do them. Why? Because \"thats the way he likes to live his life and he feels like everything's gonna be fine\". The day ends. The next day he tells the viewer that hes skipping work again, implying he does it frequently, but clarifies that its because hes unemployed. The mailman delivers mail but he adds the details that he was late and wa s actual ly a woman. She then breaks into the same jingle steve did earlier saying \"thats the way i like to live my life...\" . All of a sudden theres a change of scenery and he starts talking about mountains that we can see are right behind his house yet he says \"I don't remember why i first saw the mountains\". He then says that they've ALWAYS been there. He wonders why they're there but whether he knows or not he has to accept that they're there. He says that he can't claim them. Then he does a complete 180 and states that he can and does so very quickly. He then starts the jingle from before. \"Thats the way i like to live my life..\" but he gets cut off right as he starts, its another mail delivery. This time the person delivering it is a bird but he doesn't mention anything about it nor does he mention anything about the mail being delivered straight to him rather then to his house. The mailman doesn't break into a jingle this time, only saying \"heres the mail.\" The letter is adres sed to s teve despite that not being his name, which he points out, and it asks how he climbed the mountain. Steve says he glad the person asked and gives a simple answer saying that its a simple two step process, first find the mountain, then climb it. After this steve breaks into the last jingle of the video but this time he says \"Thats the way we can get things done and thats how I do it, its easy and simple cause you know what to do.\" Steve stands there smiling when a downpour starts but steve doesn't react at all simply standing there and smiling. A 5 day weather forecast pops up on screen showing nothing but rain for each day and it moves rapidly showing rain for many more days then 5. Steve then says \"bye i'm steve\" despite saying it wasn't his name earlier and the screen cuts to black. Part 2: Breakdown of Steve This is obviously a very confusing story. The main character \"steve\" makes many contradictory and strange statements and bizarre things ha ppen wit h no explanation. To fully understand this we need to look at the story part by part then look at the big picture. First of all why does steve introduce himself as steve and then say thats not actually his name? The character steve seems to represent many things throughout the story, at times he operates the same as any normal person, or character in a story might but at other times he does very strange things. He changes his identity and says things that are impossible such as him driving a car in a tree, theres also a point where a talking bird delivers him mail. Steve doesn't pay taxes and doesn't have a job, He's also secluded from others in the mountains. These traits are indicative of multiple personality disorder and schizophrenia. The viewer isn't a character in the story but he talks to the viewer, rather then just narrating whats happening I think steve is talking to himself and the viewer is seeing whats happening through his eyes, this is why we saw the bird talk ing. The first real thing does in the story is file for an extension on his tax returns and then say he wont ever be paying them. Although this statement may seem like he doesn't plan to pay what he owes, I think whats actually happening is steve doesn't owe anything at all. Steve doesn't appear to live in a city but rather a rural area with mountains so it may be either he is excused from paying taxes because of his mental ailments or the government of his country doesn't require its citizens to pay taxes. Part 3: breakdown of events First, Either way the point of him filing for an extension is pointless, he also says he doesn't have a job. steve appears to live a life without a goal. He's secluded in the mountains and his mental afflictions may prevent him from growing or working towards something meaningful. His random bursts into jingles show how childlike his mental state is and the flashing colors show his warped views of reality. Despite this he t hinks ev erything is going to be ok and his more or less happy with himself. One day the mailman delivers the mail and this is when he starts to say something rational although pointless and unneeded. He says the mailman was actually a woman and was late, despite this statement being unneeded it makes sense and theres no indication of it being false. Yet when the mailman comes she also bursts into the same jingle steve was doing. The mailman may have similar mental issues to steve and the two of them are just role-playing, She isn't dressed like a mailman and its never said that she delivers anything to steve, simply dances and leaves. She also doesn't identify herself as a mailman but steve does, maybe its because she did deliver something to steve without him realizing. Steve might have just imagined the mailman doing the jingle as well. I think the two most important things here are that first of all the mailman was late, in the way that steve is late to life. As a fully grown adu lt he st ill acts like a kid but the mailman \"delivered\" something to him, a doctor delivering medicine. Steve gains newfound clarity and sees the mountains behind him. The mountains are his mental problems, the things he can't do becase of his mental condition. He doesn't know why he first saw them, he wasn't aware that he was being medicated but they've always been there, just like his mental issues. He feels like he'll never be able to climb them but after the delivery he is able to right away. The medicine is working. As soon as he reaches the top he tries to do his jingle but he can't, he's no longer happy. Theres another delivery but the person delivering it is a bird. This could be steves issues presenting themselves once again, but he doesn't say anything. The medication didn't solve the underlying problems but merely allowed him to hide them, this is why he sees a bird but makes no comment. To someone not seeing it through steves eyes he would seem normal. This is shown again when hes called steve and despite him not thinking that its his name he just says \"whatever\" and goes along with it, he doesn't know he's steve but he just hides the fact he thinks he isn't. He starts being interviewed about how he solved his mental issues, maybe by a doctor or family member. He gives a very simple answer that isn't very helpful at all because he doesn't know how he climbed the mountain and his issues are still there, they just went up the mountain with him but he keeps up the image of being a normal person. he does a jingle but its different this time, theres no mention of him being alright or happy he just says that he solved his problems. His issues are never solved until the end. The rain starts and steve just keeps standing there and smiling despite the heavy downpour and he doesn't go into a jingle or say anything and the weather forecast shows never ending rain. Steve is depressed. The medication is making him a depressed mess keeping his schizoph renia and mpd inside but he's no longer happy. Everntually steve accepts that this wont change. He says \"Bye i'm steve\" showing that he's lost who he truly is, he doesn't make an effort to find the happy person he was before by saying hes not actually steve and kills himself. This is a dark commentary on how the mentally ill live in todays society and the overmedication not being an answer. Steve was fine before anyone decided his pointless life wasn't ok and after they decided they fixed him steve lost the person he was when he was happy and can no longer bear his own life.\ufeff",
        "answer": "shockingly sad. i didn't think i could possibly read something so sad absolutely not. this analysis is sadder than anything i could have imagined \"filing for an extension on my taxes\" i thought was a nice line for that point in the video because it was a nice contrast to the much simpler items that come before it (drive a car, in a tree, what's your name, that type of stuff.) it was fun to jump to something much more 'grownup' and verbose. but the line also has a twist at the end because he says he's never going to pay the taxes. which i thought was a fun idea because if he's not going to pay them, then why is he filing for an extention, right this is almost an identical strategy to the taxes line. i'm skipping work again today (which seemed neat because it implies that you skip work a lot, so shouldn't you have been fired by now?) but adding \"because i don't have a job\" i just thought was a nice twist. steve is unpredictable. i wouldn't jump to conclusions. also there is a large goal coming up just a few seconds later which spoiler alert he achieves that's not necessarily true yet at this point in the video the flashing colors are not necessarily seen by steve, they are seen by the viewer. and the music is not necessarily something that steve is actually doing or taking part in, it is just a device for the viewer. think of theatrical musical productions. the characters break into song, but are we really expected to believe that the characters spontaneously sing songs that seem pre writen, about their lives, and it is already fully rehearsed and harmonized with multiple characters taking part, AND with musical accompaniment coming from seemingly nowhere? this first jingle takes it to an emotional level for the first time, i think at the right time. it reflects emotionally on what happened, for the first time. whereas the previous events (car, tree, etc) might lead you to think this story is just going to be a series of him telling you 'then i this, then i that.' but after about the 3rd or 4th thing i think it's important to stop for a minute to sing a simple song of human emotion, optimism, and reflection upon the events. sure it's a bit careless because we're kind of neglecting the tax situation, but that's not the strangest thing that's happened so far, in fact this first jingle seems to be the first bit with no new information, which in itself makes it feel new in that regard, because as i said we are getting to an emotionally reflective level on previous events, for the first time, without piling on new events emotionlessly. that's not true. it is implied that she delivers the mail every day, like most mail carriers do. the point of this scene (next day, mailman, etc) is to generally keep the ball rolling on the new information and situations, and to continue to keep you guessing as to what is going on. we've already set the stage in 'verse 1' with the name, car, tree and stuff, now the idea is to sort of continue the game. the point of the 'woman' line is, again, we're adding a twist to the end of the line. like the end of the taxes line, or the end of the skipping work line. the idea of a mailman who is a woman seems fun to me because the word 'mailman' sounds like it's a man. but it's actually a woman. and i just thought it was an interesting place to reveal someone's gender. right. i figured it was a nice time to go back into that jingle, because it is almost sooner than you would expect, but it is familiar, so things don't get too crazy just yet. and the twist here is, it almost sounds as though she's singing about her gender, almost as if she chose to be that gender. i figured this was probably a nice touch, because gender freedom is something that i think we've all been thinking about more and more these days. but again it's not totally clear why she is singing it. it is left slightly up in the air, which again i think is a nice strategy especially for a video like this where you are never quite sure what the heck is going on. i was planning on giving her some kind of postal uniform, but she looked better wearing the same type of clothes as steve. no one really knows why paper mail carriers are there anymore. nowadays we mostly use email for everything. which is another reason why 'mailman' seems like a fun idea. everyone knows what it is, and it seems familiar, yet in the back of your mind, what are they really doing? it's just a person who visits your house every day. which seems nice that is not necessarily true that's not true at all. if she were delivering medicine i would have used an icon that looked more like medicine, not envelopes. also this is off the subject but i just realized you did not notice that steve's house does not have a door. the point of the mountains is to add a new larger twist to the feel of the video. we've already gone through some 'daily' sounding sort of riff raff (cars, names, mail, paperwork, etc.) and we've also seen the same jingle twice, so it almost feels like we're in a pattern. so time for something bigger, different, at a different pace. the mountains scene is at a much slower pace, much more of an ominous, deep feeling. that's the most unexpectedly dismal analysis i could possibly imagine i tried to put some very subtle and peculiar inconsistencies in the way the grammar is phrased here. you might think it should say 'suddenly i saw the mountains which i had never noticed becore, and i don't remember them being there.' but it's different to say ' i don't remember Why i first saw them.' basically i'm taking common phrases but turning them around just a little bit in ways that i haven't quite heard before, but they feel the same. there was no delivery. steve's house doesn't have a door. right. again, using pacing and timing here. after a long ominous segment about the mountains seeming impenetrable and immoveable, downright unclimbable, we suddenly kill the music and ominous tones and unexpectedly we can climb the mountains. what's more is, i used present tense for both. so it's not even like 'i couldn't climb them, but now i can' it's an even more sudden switch than that, 'i can't climb them but i can' it's most like a quantum mechanical paradox. and it's off to the races, we jump back into the jingle because that's what you might expect, but usually it's a good practice to stay one step ahead of the audience. they already get the idea. so there is an interruption immediately medicine is a fun sounding and interesting concept, like mail, cars, or trees. it is likely that this video Could have had scenes about medicine, maybe if it continued, or if i wrote another similar video. if i wanted to use the idea of medicine, i would do it in a way that actually mentions it, because i do think it is a fun thing to mention. i have done other videos and tweets which mention the idea. i would not do it in a secret and dark way, that is not my idea of a good time that's ridiculous. the reason this jingle stopped is clearly an interruption from the mailbird. and it's very casual in nature. there is no indication that steve is disappointed by being interrupted. it's very casual. it's just another surprise, intertwined with something familiar (the mail). the surprise is that there is mail on the top of the mountain, and how did it come so quickly, how did anyone know steve was up there, etc etc etc. and it's a bird because why not. also i have no idea what kind of bird that is. some people said it was a kiwi but i just made something up. the script said it was actually supposed to be a penguin, but i was working off phone timers to get this thing done (video making takes a long time, you gotta stay on top of the time) so i just drew the fastest thing i could. turned out to probably not be a penguin. there is no medication in this video but i have noticed that there is a lot of medication in this analysis. again, just trying to keep it interesting. sure the mailman is a bird and it's on top of a mountain etc etc, but this is all part of the counter-swing of the pendulum from the slow, deep segment before about the mountain. from the suddenly climbing the mountain, it's light quick jumps, and before you know it we're reading a letter, and it's suddenly a q&a video, which at this point seems appropriate because what the fuck is happening so far in this video, it's about time we start taking some questions. this part was fun, because it was an excuse to bring back the name ambiguity. obviously the letter should say 'dear steve' because you naturally think this guy's name is steve, because the video is called 'hi i'm steve' with him in the picture, and the first thing that happens in the video is you see the guy tell you his name is steve. so honestly even i forgot his name wasn't steve, until i said it (\"dear steve\") and then i instantly realized the fun built-in opportunity to reference the name ambiguity here, which sort of anchors that as a recurring theme. also gives steve a chance to mug to the camera which i thought was neat. was very careful on the facial expression here so as to not seem too mad nor too happy. just kind of shrugging it off. that's not true, he is asked what i think is a very obvious question, how did he climb this mountain which he seemingly just climbed in 2 seconds. that question seemed to be the most important and relevant question at that time in the video. there are other questions, but that seemed especially relevant because it is about something very large that just happened moments ago. (also another added twist is how did someone ask this via postal mail so quickly) i think the more important part of this section is the part just before he gives the explanation. he looks in the air for a minute, and i feel like we're really not sure what tone this video is going to take. honestly the \"well i'm glad you asked that\" is something that's been lingering in my head for a long time, there is a music video for a 1988 song called 'da butt', and in the intro to the video, spike lee is interviewed and he answers the question starting just like that 'well i'm glad you asked that' in a very similar tone and i just thought it was great. so that type of tone on that line has been stuck in my head for a while now. and as for the 2 step program, i think a detailed setup with bluntly simple contents is always a nice device i think, i have done it in a lot of my videos, and i have always fallen in love with it seeing it other places. (there is a tweet somewhere, not mine, that says \"parts of the worm\" and listed underneath it just says \"worm.\") it's just a fun device, set things up formally and yet have the contents be way more simple than you expected it. And, getting metaphorical about the mountains, let's say it does represent challenges and obstacles (which i think it does) sometimes there is really no good explanation for solving them. you just do it. but actually now that i think about it, this 2 step program is very important because a lot of people miss the first step. identifying the problem is so incredibly important and solving it actually gets surprisingly easier when you just identify the problem! so actually i wholeheartedly believe in that explanation. yes, it's time for another jingle! and let's do a different one this time because we've already surely exhausted the other one. i think the music sounds very, very happy. he's also smiling and dancing. and the lyrics to the jingle are very happy. this part of the video screams happiness with flying colors, but i respect your opinion that's not quite what it says, it is more of a conclusion to his quick lesson. this is a general celebration that problem solving is possible. yikes, i am starting to wish i never read this analysis. so depressing. ok so after this 3rd jingle, there really is a sense of conclusion to this video, it seems like everything that's gonna happen has happened. we've used words, music, together in all the fun usual ways that i like to use them in videos. so what else can be done? well, weather speaks very loudly, at least to me, especially rain. basically the entire video up until this point has been full of words and music, the only thing left to do was rain. no words, no music. it was probably just about the last twist that i could have gotten mileage out of. it feels like stepping out of the paradigm of the video, again because no words no music. this is just what rain actually sounds like in real life. and again, i think it still keeps you guessing about what is going to happen next. the length of this section is really sort of the 'big finish' of the video. like i said, it feels complete at this point, so we go heavy on the rain, dragging out the time (even showing a weather graphic that further represents this time drag, showing endless rain in the future) and wrap it up! given that this line is almost exactly the same as the first line of the video, it seems hard to argue that we're \"lost.\" seems more charactaristic of something being \"found.\" ...A couple of nice bonuses i found in the last line, 1. it sounds exactly like the first line (hi/bye rhymes) 2. you don't normally introduce yourself when you leave, which makes for an interesting sounding phrase that you don't hear too often, and 3. adding further controversy to the name issue, as if he just admitted his name was steve? either way it's nice closure because he said that at the beginning as well. i wish i never read this i can't believe i responded to this. this is terrible"

I know you can write a song in multiple time signatures anyways.. but I say cut out the middle man, just think tempo/pulse of individual beats instead of grouping beats together.",
        "answer": "yes, but the majority of all music has a habit of falling into groups of 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. by putting bar lines around 4 beats, and also putting 4 bars per line on the page, it makes it way way easier to read. it's like using periods between sentences, or spaces between words"

'not so hard to do' was just bringing the collection down. i just didn't like it. i think i would have been more comfortable putting it there if there had been more other videos there. and i took down the 'foot' video because the suggested video images that popped up on screen afterwords were horrifying. they were all like insane foot diseases etc. it was very overwhelming, and they came up instantly after my video. it was just too much. i normally don't pay attention to that sort of thing, but this was right when i was first using youtube and i was pretty uncomfortable with that, especially because i was used to putting the videos on my own site, where they can live in peace"

        "answer": "i just call it a 'quiet verse.' i've never found a better name for it. it specifically means the verse that occurs nearing the end of the song, after at least 2 choruses have happened and usually after the bridge if there is one. the dynamic drops low, it mimics the verse, and very often jumps back up to a high dynamic to usher into the last chorus(s). very standard technique. in this case we've used a half-length-verse, and also a half-length pre-chorus."

        "answer": "ah, welcome to the waterfall. after enjoying that free-falling feeling of helplessly falling into the abyss for quite a while, suddenly you will remember that with a little organization, you can easily separate this into 2 distinct job titles. one where you just write down and log the new ideas as they occur, like a bolt of lightening, try to get down as much as you can in the moment, (this may happen anywhere! at the mall, at the zoo, remember to keep small tools on hand to be able to catch these ideas at any time. in todays day in age i recommend a smart phone, etc). And then, at another time, in another suit, at another desk, as a different employee, you will get down to work in a nice, quiet place. Which idea the 'worker' chooses to work on will have nothing to do with which idea was created first, or last, or anything else. There will need to be another decision system that chooses which idea to do when. and i don't know what the best way is, that is something you will have to manage within the company as a whole. but if all else fails, computer aided random number selection does work. So actually there is 3 job titles. the dreamer (idea creator) the worker (who works on the idea) and the manager, who SOMEHOW has to decide what idea to work on. i think it is very important that the worker and the manager do not play the same role at the same time-- the worker needs to never question the authority of the decision to work on the project at hand, or else they will not be able to focus on making that project the best it can be. the manager needs to make that decision, and then tell the worker what the project is."

        "question": "\"Hope You Have A Good Day\" is not six seconds, its twelve. You've labeled it wrong.",
        "answer": "that's not true. the reason the looping videos are labeled that way is because they were originally written for vine, where they automatically loop, seamlessly. and the loop is 6 and a half seconds long (or less). When posting those videos to non-looping sites, it would be rude to just post it 1 time through with no loop, you would never get to hear how it loops. so in most cases, such as \"chips\", \"letterman\", \"person\", \"how bout going to the mall\", and many others, i sent it around twice on the nonlooped version so at least you can hear what it sounds like. but i chose to still label the length of the content based on the length of the material that loops. this is to clarify the fact that the second time through is not different in any way. you are seeing the same (in the case you mentioned) 6 seconds of content, repeated. there is only 6 seconds of content, but you are seeing it displayed twice because it is meant to be viewed in a loop. i hope that makes sense"

        "question": "Hey, so i know that the vocal melody is probably the most important thing when determining the key of a song (you don't want to be in a key that makes it hard for you to sing the melody).... But, do you ever transpose the key of the song just to intentionally mix things up? Like, if you post a song in the key of D or whatever, you'd probably not want the next song you post to be in the same key,right? Do you think that's also something you should do when playing live (don't play two songs in the same key back to back)?",
        "answer": "that is true, it is ususlly better not to have 2 songs in the same key in a row. and maybe i have actually transposed things a half step sometimes to directly avoid this, but not very often (and maybe never actually) but it seems strange to do this because the songs may be released in different orders on different platforms for different audiences."

        "answer": "because at the time that i started making videos regularly, that was the size that automatically fit on the screen on the computer / web browser that i was using. 1280x720 (or larger) would go off the screen by default, and require clicking extra buttons to see the whole thing. actually, this is still the case on my current computer / browser. Another reason to keep the file sizes low on the site is because i do not use streaming on the site. smaller files means faster load time. if you prefer a streaming experience you can always use youtube, but i prefer to actually load the files because then you can pause/unpause (to discover those dank secrets!) and just really horse around with the play slider, which is generally a must-have for me when i watch videos. it's what drives me crazy about watching on youtube, you really can't manipulate the playback nearly as readily as i would prefer"

        "question": "Hey Bill I just saw on instagram that you use a very old version of Final Cut. I think you should switch to the pro X version because the magnetic time alone will save you a ton of time on your videos (you can also disable it when need be). I think you will also be able to transfer your current graphics to the new version of final cut. All this should enable you to finish something like the Japan video in 1 month. Although it may seem uncomfortable I believe that it is an absolute necessary step if you want to continue making longer videos within a reasonable amount of time. I am not an editing expert so I cannot offer you a tutorial. But if the tutorials on youtube don't help I'm sure one of your fans would be willing to help you over email on a step by step basis if you like. Would you be willing to consider it?",
        "answer": "it is important to remember that on history of japan, more than 1 month was spent on things outside of the program you mentioned. it is upsetting to me when people think they have any idea what goes on in the process, and make assumptions about what takes which amount of time"

        "question": "you replied to a question: \"i can find the prime factorization of 6 digit numbers in my head\" do you have a trick to do this? how would I find the prime factorization of 239429 in my head?",
        "answer": "since it's already odd and doesn't have 5, check for 3. the check for 3 is if the digits add up to another multiple of 3. you can also do this by knocking off all multiples of 3 you see in the digits, even if it's multiple digits next to each other. so delete the 9s, delete the 3, and delete the \"42\". and you're left with 2 which is not a multiple of 3 so we've ruled out 3. Now you just start moving through the prime numbers, checking each one. there are many different tricks here, but it's generally the same strategies for every other prime from now on. let's say we're checking for 7 (the next prime to check for). see the 23, on the left? that's close to 21, so let's change that to 2. == 29429. what this means is, we just subtracted 210000 from the original number. so what this means is, if the original number is a multiple of 7, then 2949 has to be a multiple of 7 also because we just subtracted 210000 (which is clearly a multiple of 7). basically we manipulate the original number by multiples of 7, until it is simple enough to see whether the resulting number is a multiple of 7. and if it is, congratulations the original number was a multiple of 7 also. in the manipulations, you are allowed to add or subtract any multiple of 7, and you can also multiply or divide by anything you want. so from 29429, i can see \"42\" in there, so you can just replace that with zero 29009 (we just subtracted 420, which of course is a multiple of 7). now let's add 21 == 29030, knock off the zero at the end (you can divide this by 10 and it won't effect whether or not it's a mutiple of 7, so you can knock off zeros on the end all you want.) so 2903. now let's add 7 == 2910, knock off the zero = 291. (you can see the strategy, we're adding/subtracting small multiples of 7 based on whatever can even off the end to have a zero at the end, because then we can kill the zero and the number shrinks and still has its same status with regard to being a multiple of 7 or not.) so from 291, take off 21 is 270, knock off the zero is 27. which is clearly NOT a multiple of 7. basically i'm adding and subtracting multiples of seven to get the number simpler and simpler until eventually we can tell if the resulting number is a multiple of 7. and if you couldn't see whether 27 was a multiple of 7 then you could just knock off the 7 and it's 20, knock off the zero is 2. which is not a multple of 7. So congratulations, the original number (239429) is not a multiple of 7. Next we check for 11s. i would start with the left again, because 23 is so close to 22. replace it with 1 == 19429. then add 11 to the right,(and kill the zero) 1944. you can knock off 44, and pow, 19, not 11. so 11 is ruled out. Then start again for 13. from the left, change the 23 to 10 (effectively subtracting 130000), == 109429. '109' is 5 above 104 which i happen to know has 13 in it, so replace 109 with 5. == 5429. 54 is 2 above 52, which i happen to know has 13 in it, so 229. what's the nearest multiple of 13 above 229? 260. is that a multiple of 13 away? can't be because the only one in that century with 1 at the end of it is 91 and it's not 91 away (it's 31 away, again non-13.) so 13 is out. now check for 17. repeat this process through the primes, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, etc etc. and you may be wondering \"how far do i have to go before knowing if the original number is prime.\" well the answer is, if you are checking them all in order and you do it correctly, the process is guaranteed complete once you reach the square root of the original number. the way to loosely figure that out is, look at 250000. square root of that should be 5 with zeros ...500 times 500 should be 250000. so in this case if you check all the primes up to 500 and you don't find a match then you know you can stop. but if you find a match at let's say 31, then you divide the thing by 31 and then you have a much smaller number to work with, and find the primes there. then when you're done just include 31 as well. by the way i didn't check 31 in this example so 31 probably is not in there"

        "question": "i don't understand the harmonic function of Sus chords. Seems to me like a chord that's dominant but cute, and like a shortcut to chords that leads to another colours. what do you think about it?",
        "answer": "a good starting point to understanding sus chords is: play a C major triad (C, E, G). ok now play it with F note instead of E: (C, F, G). that is called Csus4. ok now play Csus4, then C. nice! Ok now also there is a rumor going around that if you use 2 instead of 4 (C,D,G) that is called Csus2, but that one doesn't really take as much pleaseure in the resolve as the Csus4 to C resolve. but it's still easier to say Csus2 than to say Cadd2no3. even quicker to just say C2, which is what i usually say. also you may have noticed that Csus4 can be the same as Fsus2, depending on whether the bass player is playing C or F. i'm not sure if that answers your question."

At this point I am 20 and there is so much I want to prove, I want to grow beyond measures and make an impact in the animation industry (my life goal). I know I must resolve myself to this goal. Do you feel like you have to choose? Between a relationship with someone or working in solitude. I haven't received an assault of questions of when I am going to get married or settle down yet but I know in the few years I will. It's a suffocating feeling. I hope this isn't intrusive but did you go through something similar and what are you thoughts?",
        "answer": "it's a classic situation for focused and hardworking artists (or any career) to find themselves in a relationship where the other person realizes that the artist needs to make their work the #1 priority. it is a very common story, but not the end of the world. it just means those types of relationships won't work. this is very very common, and it is also common for hardworking and focused artists to find relationships that work. usually when the other person has equally strong passions of their own, maybe different, maybe even the same one. i've seen this work plenty of times. but the failed relationship you're talking about is a classic story, and very common among people in your situation. i've been in one of those relationships as well. it's no big deal, you just learn why it doesn't work, and you both move on"

I have about 10 years of piano lessons behind me, but I still can't seem to \"just make stuff up\" I don't understand how some people can just listen to a tune and improvise something that sounds incredible off of it. I know some music theory so I can do very simple harmony beneath a melody that I've heard, but I don't know how to make it sound good or jazzy. When I try to mess around on the piano I always revert back to trying to follow the rules I've been taught but failing to turn it into an effective song.

        "answer": "the downbeat usually means any of the 4 quarter notes (in 4/4 for example). the upbeat is the in between 8th note. the 2 and 4 can be called the 'backbeat' if there is a snare, clap, etc happening there. 1 and 3 would be the 'white beat' because that's when all the white people clap. god bless, they're trying their hardest"

I think there are distinct styles of music.. but just cause these styles exist doesn't mean that every band or artist can/should be categorized by these labels. There's plenty of music that blurs the lines, and plenty of music that doesn't really line up with any particular style. On the other hand though, there are a lot of bands/artists that do identify with a specific genre or style cause it has some kind of significance to them... I think there's musicians who are proud to say \"I play blues music\" or \"I play punk rock\" or \"I play reggae\" or whatever... what do you think? Are genres completely, 100% non-existant? Why or why not?",
        "answer": "you can make music any way you want, there's infinite ways to make it. you can also make up names for things if you think that helps, sometimes it does. sometimes the whole point of creation is to evade those names. sometimes the names mean different things to different people, and they almost always change after 10 years. i'm not sure if that answers your question"

        "question": "I was reading about how musicians use to get different effects and sounds from their instruments 'back in the day.' Some pretty cool stuff. In You Really Got Me, Ray Davies apparently used a razor blade to splice the speaker cone in his amp and poked pins into the cone. In Street Fighting Man, Keith Richards got an electric-guitar sound from an acoustic by using a tape cassette to record and overdub the parts and by playing right up to the mic. Link Wray used to poke holes in his speaker cone with pencils to get that fuzzy tone. You had all sorts of experimentation with reel to reel tape recorders to get echos and other weird effects. Lots of old blues guitarists would turn the gain and volume all the way up on lo-fi amps to the point of nearly blowing out the speakers to get their sounds. Sam Phillips (who produced a lot of those 50's rockabilly/rock 'n' roll records with Sun Records) would re-feed the playback from the recorder to the head, adjusti ng the s pace between the heads, tape speed and other stuff to make crazy echo and delay effects.... Today with all sorts of effects pedals, built in effects on amplifiers, digital recording sofwares where you can alter the sounds in so many different ways, do you think that these \"proto-effects\" or these old recording techniques are obsolete? When you're recording do you ever experiment with any of this type of stuff to create effects or different sounds, or do you it all on the computer, effects pedals, etc.?",
        "answer": "sure, but there are new techniques. or you can use old techniques too if you want. maybe even use future techniques those techniques you mentioned never really made sense for me because i grew up in the digital age. but there are plenty of interesting rebellious \"wrong\" practices you can do in the digital age, or in any age. for example in the video \"Are you the Real You\" i decided to not actually crop out the screen fully on some of those text items, so some of the computer menus and window edges can actually be seen in the video. it was originally a mistake, but it adds character so i left it in. another crazy technique someone showed me many years ago was to open a picture in a text program (it looks like nonsense text) and start changing the letters. the picture glitches out in weird ways. i've never actually used that but that's another example of ways you can have fun in the post digital age"

It's kinda tragic, but it's one of the reasons why I really like your site. I think some users are trying to force you into some kind of \"Genre\" of creator (whether it be your site or music or etc) so much that people seem to believe that you're trying to be irreverent, but all you do is just... *is*. Words kinda fail me there, and that's okay I think. People are looking at the pages that update \"top-down\" (as in \"updates as you finish content\" such as the music, videos, and most of the time the questions page) a nd autom atically assume that it applies to Literally Everything In The Entire World Ever All The Time Always when your notebook stuff is clearly labeled with a very definite Date Of Time, emphasizing Creation Chronology, but your site didn't exist forever so you come to this design dilemma for the content that was made Pre-Website: Emphasize Creation Chronology, or Update Chronology?

His quote was that \"the listener will not ever consciously say 'those are two new notes I haven't heard\". But, in fact, it will be refreshing to the ear.\" He also compared the same thing to comedy, saying that you can establish a comedic pattern, but then once the pattern is recognized you have to alter it.

        "question": "Hello! Couple questions for you... When writing out the script for your videos, do you also make notes for yourself about stuff like vocal inflections, tone, delivery, timing, etc? Also, is there any improvisation involved in the score/background music (I think you said before you do that part last, but do you fully chart it out before recording it?) or improvisation in the main jingles? For example in 'hi, i'm steve'... for the mailwoman's variation of the \"that's the way i like to live my life\" jingle there's a little keyboard fill that comes right after \"live my life\". Was that fill entirely written out note-by-note beforehand?",
        "answer": "yes. sometimes that stuff is obvious based on the words. but when i really want to clarify the specifics of that stuff, i record a quick audio or video demo / talk through, explaining and demonstrating whatever i think needs to be clarified. this is also where i demo jingles, and demonstrate exact note/harmony choices for the jingles the score is done after the narration and graphics, through experimentation. it is not written prior. all the vocal parts (lyrics, melody, harmony) is written very exactly during the script writing that was added very late in production. like on the last day probably. that is what i would call an 'auxiliary spice', i do it for songs too, basically it's during troubleshooting you notice parts where you're afraid it's too boring. so you throw something in to spice it up"

        "question": "I'm not quite sure how to put this... I know you say that the best chord is the one that supports the melody and that the melody and chords are inherently connected to each other... but I guess I'm wondering if you got any tips on working out specific chord voicings? I can come up with chords that I think are a good fit with the melody.. but too often I find myself just doubling the chord in my left and right hand (on piano btw) which probably isn't the best thing to do. I know it depends on the particular arrangement of the song, but what are some good ways to get around this? Sometimes I'll play different inversions. Like for example to do like a cm9 chord I might play a cm7 (C,Eb,G,Bb) with the left hand and a Ebmaj7 (Eb,G,Bb,D) with my right.... but I don't know. Sometimes that big full sounds good with solo piano, but it can be too much with a full band. As a general guideline, is it better to use less notes in the bass and put the bulk of the h armony h igher up?",
        "answer": "never do that. that's like drawing your character's face on their head and their ass at the same time in a certain range (bass/low) only use single notes. right in the middle near middle C, that is usually where the heart of your chord lives. Believe it or not, the melody actually should go there too, usually on a different instrument. in the higher range way above that will be sprinkles and twinkles. it's almost always a bad idea to play exactly the same chord configuration in different octaves. it's kind of like writing on a paper that's a gradient from top to bottom. if you write with the same color pen from top to bottom, on a gradually shaded page, the pen is going to have a different visual effect depending on what part of the page its on not good to think in 'chords' with both hands. think about building chords using the whole keyboard, and throw the 'stacked thirds' theory of chords out the window, and just start from scratch. find the notes you need, on the whole keyboard, and use only the notes you need. it might only be one note, it might be 2. and use whatever hands you need, in order to play the notes you need, wherever they may be. Another way of looking at it -- if you are by yourself, play chords with your right hand and play bass (1 note!) with your left. Or, if you are playing the melody and chords, and someone else is the bass player, then i guess play chords in the middle range with your LEFT hand, and do the melody with your right hand. and if your band already has a bass player and someone else playing the melody, then tie one hand behind your back. the bass should only be 1 note at a time. the way the notes work is, the lower you go, the less notes you can play. this is a very clearly defined thing, there is something called \"lower interval limits\" and i think if you look it up you will find very clearly when to stop using which intervals as you go lower. actually, don't look it up, just experiment for yourself. 1 note is the lowest -- for example, the lower interval limit is, let's say, the B at the very bottom of a grand piano. that's the lowest you can really go and have the note still sound like a note (i'm sure people will argue that the limit is actually lower, but i don't really care, beyond that low B it really turns to mud). actually screw it let's say C because it's easier for this example. so let's say low C on the 88key piano is the lowest limit for single note (this also happens to be right at the bottom of the range of the 5 string bass guitar) ok so that's the lower limit for 1 note. next thing to look at is a perfect fifth. the lower interval limit for a perfect 5th is exactly 1 octave above that -- which in this case means C and G, in the second octave of a grand piano -- so the second lowest C and the second lowest G. This would be about as low as you can put perfect 5ths and still have them sound coherent (again, people will argue that you can go lower, but for the sake of this example i'm keeping it at C). Next look at 4ths -- this piggybacks on the 5th -- the same G, and the next C. that is the lowest your 4ths are going to work. I should mention, in heavy rock bands with distorted guitars, all those heavy metal riffs are usually written with \"power chords\" which is root-5th-root, hugging the lower limit, and the bass is an octave down, also hugging the lower limit for single note. standard tuning puts both instruments at E, and many bands downtune and B is just about as low as they usually go, before it starts becoming unintelligible. this is another simple way to observe the lower-limit phenomenon in common practice among distorted guitar metal bands, etc. So piggybacking on what we have so far (did i mention we are just climbing up the harmonic series) the next note on top of that C would be E. so for major thirds, that would be the lower limit for 3rds. counting Cs up from the bottom of the grand piano, that would be the 3rd C and the E above it. that should be about as low as major 3rds will work. continuing on, the next note in the harmonic series is G, so the minor third right there (E-G) in that octave should be the lowest that minor thirds will be happy. again, the lower limits are actually perhaps a few notes lower than all the ones i'm mentioning, i'm just putting it a little higher and keeping it in C for the sake of the explanation. that is basically how it works. tigher clusters gradually work better as you go up, bass only works with single notes, a little higher and 5ths work but not 3rds, and then the 3rds become clear a little higher, etc etc. i hope this makes sense. imagine your pen gets thicker as the notes get lower. so you have to write bigger and make the linest further apart. where as up higher, it's like writing with a smaller pen, you can do much more complicated smaller designs and still see it. i just realized i have probably explained this entire thing on this questions page at least a couple of times before"

When I say things like \"if I stop running I will die,\" or \"if I keep eating chips and jerking myself off all day I will die\" to people they usually think I am sick or something. I know I'm not sick but sometimes things I say don't fit into others' worldviews. What should I say to the people I care about and who care about me but just happen to think differently than me?",
        "answer": "that sounds about right that's not true, just because you aren't doing the thing that is the main point doesn't mean you are not doing it. for example if you are playing a video game but are not doing very well and not really scoring points, you are still playing the game. you are just perhaps not doing very well at the game perhaps 'hi'"

        "question": "in i wanna be a movie star is the chorus like 16/16 or whatever and then the verse 9/8 or am i just really bad at figuring out time signatures? speaking of, what is the difference between 4/4 8/8 16/16 2/2 or anything else like that",
        "answer": "the chorus has 9 beats in the cycle. you can break it up however you choose, but i chose to hear it as alternating 4/4 + 5/4. the verses are initially based on that pattern but break it also. those are all mathematically the same (like the bars will look the same on paper) but usually the second number says what kind of note gets the beat. so like, in 4/4, the quarter note is where the beat is. in 2/2 (also nicknamed \"cut time\") the bars look exactly the same, but the half note gets the beat (you tap your foot on the half note intead of the quarter note.) the main difference would really be the tempo -- cut time (2/2) is designed for the bars to basically go twice as fast. and when you see a tempo marking on the top of the page, it will say \"half note = xxx b.p.m\" instead of \"quarter note = xxx b.p.m\". so in cut time (2/2) the bars will usually go by twice as fast. what the point of this is exactly, i'm not sure. i think cut time was used much more 100 years ago. perhaps people were too lazy to write 16th notes and preferred to use 8th notes for the fast stuff instead. i'm not sure. 8/8 and 16/16 are really never used. time signatures ending in 8 also don't necessarily follow this rule of what note gets the beat, for example sometimes 7/8 is used when in reality the quarter note should get the beat, and the actual time signature would be \"3 and a half/4\" but no one says that for insanity reasons. also 6/8 is very very commonly counted as the dotted quarter note getting the beat, in which case the actual time signature would technically be \"2/2.66666\" which again would be completely insane to see written on the page"

But it's obvious from this page that your actual music knowledge is vast and that you didnt stick to messing around and actually took some serious time to study music and music history, get acquainted with various styles including classical and jazz and also you even revealed that you actually had some formal tutoring/training as well (7.13.17 11:58 am). Isn't it a little disingenious to just say to people to mess around with music when there's so much more to music than that? Sorry if it sounds like an accusatory question, i dont mean anything bad by it. Just feel like youre underselling how much work one has to put in to be bill wurtz or jay z or bono or whoever",
        "answer": "over and over and over again, people talk about learning music like it's something that someone else has to give to you, or like it's something that someone else can just make you do. that's just not how it worked for me. sure, there is a lot of language for music, like knowing the note names, even knowing what the common industry names are for chords. but that information is all out there readily available ESPECIALLY now with the internet. the only way any of that information is going to make sense is if you actually try it out. and when you are ready to learn what things are called, i think you will find that the information will be readily available. i will also readily provide that information as well. like for example, if anyone asks me what any note is called, or if anyone says \"is there a special name for when you play C, Eb, and G at the same time\", i will readily and gladly say \"that's a C minor chord.\" but if someone asks 'how to use theory to get music to sound good', i will explain again and again and again that the way to do this, and the way to learn how to do it, is by using your own experience, your own mind, your own hands, and your own ears, otherwise you're just not going to get the good stuff. i will keep trying to explain this to people until the apocolypse, maybe even after that"

I estimate you are at a level of about 7.9 Wurtz so I doubt we can go higher.

        "answer": "at this point, i have fully re-realized the importance of doing videos for songs. this is clearly illustrated in the fact that everyone thinks that movie star is a brand new song, everyone wants longer versions of the steve songs, and hardly anyone has heard of 'got to know what's going on.' most people never heard of movie star before the video. it is common knowledge that videos are vitally important for song publicity, and i have known this for a long time, but earlier this year i was hooked on the idea that i could do them without videos, for a simple reason which is that i can do songs about 4 times faster if i skip the video. this is a tempting strategy, but as i said i'm currently back in the viewpoint that videos are needed. what i'm trying to say is, i highly doubt that my next project will be a videoless song. it might be a new song together with a video, or it might be something completely different"

Another roadblock is that I don't own a kit (I live in an old apartment building, with VERY thin walls), so I practice either by tapping my feet while tapping on stuff with my hands, or by \"air drumming\". I really only get to play on an actual kit once a week or so at most (when I go over to a friends house for band practice). Any tips or advice???",
        "answer": "you can probably get pads that use a kick pedal, and you'll also need some regular drum pads, and then get like 3 or 4 snare stands, make sure they can go up high (so you can simulate the position of a high hat) and get a drum throne. and sticks of course. mentally, you can do a lot just in your mind, and simple tapping, when it comes to pattern practicing and independence, etc. You can actually even practice patterns with just the slightest twitch of your arm and leg muscles, and you will be able to simulate hand and foot patterns, and give your mind the necessary practice for integrating hand and foot patterns. But another important piece is the physical mechanics of the sticks and pedal, which you'll need to do on pads"

        "question": "Do you ever have a very specific idea of what you want (maybe like a specific graphic, visual effect, sound effect/tone, etc) but you don't know how to actually go about executing your idea? For reference, there's blogs and vlogs but I want to make condensed what I'll call \"slogs\" (sound blogs) where I record all the sounds around me (speaking, car sounds, music, radio, footsteps, cooking sounds, animal sounds, literally any sound that can be picked up by a mic) for 24 hours.. then I went to take that 24 hour recording, splice it into 10 second fragments (or maybe 5 seconds or 15 seconds, haven't decided) and layer all the spliced clips on top of eachother and play it all simultaneously so you have this cacophony of 24 hours worth of sounds smashed into 10 seconds... but I don't think recording softwares can handle that much audio files, and cpu or phone batteries don't last 24 hours.... I really want to do this, but I don't see how it can be done... . and it 's wildly frustrating for me.",
        "answer": "i think the challenges you mentioned are very possible to overcome. use a digital voice memo recorder. the one i use can hold 17 hours, and the battery life lasts for probably 10 hours but maybe more. i bought it 8 years ago, so i'm sure they're better now. but i was going to suggest you use 2. with a little practice and planning you could alternate between them. it is likely that you would only need to switch once. the next challenge is editing, but i think you can use multiplication to your advantage. and you will probably use different programs, depending on what does what better... or maybe you can do it in one. i'm pretty sure there are programs that will open a 24 hour file. really you just need to use that program to break it into 24 pieces. make sure volume is at 0 (even, not plus or minus anything), and there is no master compression or anything (garage band for example has some automatic compression i think but that will mess you up for this project). then once you have it down to 1 hour pieces, i would suggest opening them up in a program like logic or protools, and just put them all in on 24 tracks. that should be reasonable. again, no compression, and from here on, make sure that all tracks are set to about -15db, because the noise is going to stack up. export this 1 hour of 24 tracks stacked together. then open a new file and import this, and cut it into let's say 30. 30 tracks of 2 minutes each. make sure you set your time settings to be by time, and grid snap to minutes, OR if it is on a musical bars/measures setting, just set your tempo to 120 bpm (which it likely already is by default) and 2 minutes should be exactly 60 bars. so cut every 2 minutes, that's the beginning of bar 61, 121, 181, 241, and so on. stack them all down vertically, so you have 30 tracks of 2 minute regions. export this. again, NO master compression, and i think from here on you can keep your volume at 0 -- the trick is to make sure that it was low enough on the one where you lowered it. maybe even -20 would have been good, to be safe. so now you should have 1 file that's 2 minutes long that has everything. repeat the process, you are almost done, split this into 8 if you want 15 second final length, split it into 12 if you want 10 second final length, or split it into 24 if you want 5 second final length. at 120 bpm, 5 seconds is 2 and a half bars. 10 seconds is 5 bars, 15 seconds is 7 and a half bars. (that's if you are in a musical program measuring by bar. otherwise just set it to time grid). split it up, stack it up, no compression, keep the volume at zero, and then you should be done. I think this process is actually within reach. the exporting could take a while in the first round. but i think if you try different programs and perhaps toy with the values in this system, i think you can get there. Now, here is the bigger challenge, which i don't really have a solution for -- you're going to have an insane amount of walking noise, pocket noise, or even if you keep the thing out of your pocket the whole time, there is going to be loud unwanted noise any time you touch the device, or if you set it down, basically unless you are holding it the right way in your hand for the entire time. that is probably going to be the bigger challenge. because i think over 24 hours, all that noise will add up and that will be all you hear. you won't be able to hear any of the ambient noise you're looking for, because the direct mic contact noise will be about 5 times louder and i think it will fill the whole time when stacked 144,000 times. now it might be possible to use a noise gate that actually silences anything above a certain db. i'm not sure if these exist, i only know of noise gates that silence anything BELOW a certain level, or just flatten anything above a certain level, which is not what you want because you will still hear all the mic contact noises. but if you can get a noise gate that can silence anything above a certain db, i think that could be just the ticket, with some experimentation. i would recommend putting that on at the 1 hour level, applying it to all 24 1-hour tracks. i hope that helps"

'What's up' is easy to answer cause you can just say \"not much\" or say what your up to. But when people ask me \"what's good\" I feel like I shouldn't say \"not much\" or \"nothing\" cause that seems like it would be very depressing. \"What's good?\"... \"Not much\"....that makes me seem sad. Are you familiar with the \"what's good\" greeting? How would you normally respond? Am I supposed to just think of any random thing that I think is good?",
        "answer": "that is a good point. yes i am familiar with what's good, but i don't know what the current default response is. nor to what's up, to be honest. although actually they both mean \"hi\" or \"hey\", so \"what's up\" is actually an ok response to any of them. a few years ago, 'chillin' was actually a very default response to 'what's up', but i fear that i've been living in a cave for so long that that has most likely shifted since then. and it would be very helpful if someone in the know could actually update me on this"

They probably don't believe me that it's real. This happens because some lights flicker with the AC power at 50 or 60 Hz, and some of the segments are out of phase with the others. So if you vibrate your head up and down at about the same frequency, you see some lights appear to be higher or lower than others, depending whether your head is at the top or bottom of its vibration when that light flickers.

        "answer": "you really need to get this. it might seem scary at first but it doesn't take long. look at it this way, take a small range -- like the range right around middle C, (because that's actually the range the probably most chords will want to be) -- and make every chord fit right in there. because this is actually what your inversion skills are going to be used for. playing multiple chords in 1 range without having to jump the range just because you only know a certain inversion. so just pick one small range and make all the chords fit in there. then slide the range up by a 5th or so, and then do it again, find all your chords in that range. you need to be able to do this and i think you can actually learn it very quickly"

        "question": "what is attack, decay, sustain and release?",
        "answer": "attack is how quickly the note starts. so if 'attack' is set all the way short, the note starts immediately when you press the note. if 'attack' is set to a longer setting, the note will gradually fade in when you press the note. Decay is what happens to the note when you keep holding it down. very short decay means the note will drop off to silence immediately, even if you are holding it down. longer decay means it will fade out very very slowly as you hold it down, or maybe even never fade. release is what happens to the note after you let go. short release means the note disappears instantly when you let go. long release means it lingers after you let go, and fades slowly, or even if you set the release to maximum, it will probably stay forever. Sustain is an additional bonus option. instead of \"decay\" decaying to 0 volume, you can set 'sustain' at a certain level and that will be the volume level that it decays to while you are still holding the note down. then when you let go, the 'release' happens from there. so for example, if you set all 4 sliders (attack, decay, sustain, release) to \"medium\", and you press your note and hold it, the note will fade in at a medium pace, then drop down at a medium pace to a medium level. then when you let go it will drop to silence at a medium pace. i hope that makes sense"

But what bothers me most is that most young people or even older ones are not into opera at all, I think mostly because cultural marketing isn't done very well and doesn't manage to draw new audiences. How many times have I heard people found it \"annoying\"... I would find it very frustrating if my job were something few people are interested in. But here in France, you can only have recognized diplomas and be assured you can maybe get a job if you study \"\"classical\"\" music... I'm confused. What should I do?",
        "answer": "\"assured you can maybe get a job\" seems legit..... on an unrelated note, opera is 97% obsolete. that doesn't mean it's not good, and that doesn't mean you're not allowed to do it, or like it. but 'opera' is mainly a thing from a very different time than ours. i mainly cite technological reasons; microphones and speakers were not invented back then"

        "question": "so i've been playing around with learning songs by ear, and that's been working pretty well! but so far i've only been able to get pretty slow, uncomplicated ones. (e.g. most recently: peter gabriel's \"here comes the flood\" - the stripped down version, and schubert's \"du bist die ruhe\") i can almost always easily identify which notes to play until it gets up to like, 4 or more at one time. i have to sit there and go into hyperfocus and even then it takes me a minute. ive always thought i had a pretty good ear but maybe not - is this something i can develop with practice and experience? do you think it comes more naturally to some than to others?",
        "answer": "for the peter gabriel song, are you doing the vocal melody? for this one you will need to expand the range to include down to the G below your low C. i don't know if that helps. Also, I should mention, when you are learning these melodies, they will not necessarily be in the same key as the recording -- meaning, they will sound like the song if you play it by itself. but if you compare it with the recording, the whole thing may be higher or lower. also, not every song is possible to play all in 1 key. some times it borrows notes from other keys (for example, in C that means using the black notes). are you familiar with the the traditional alphabet song (also known as twinkle twinkle little star), or row, row, row your boat, or happy birthday? Try those. hint: happy birthday will actually require you to expand the range down to G, when playing it in the key of C. happy birthday would start on the low G note. the other 2 songs should start on C and only use the notes from C to C. let me know if this helps. all this is called \"playing in the key of C\", where the C note will feel like your home base. for example, if we were to play these songs in the key of D, all the notes would be up a little higher, and as an added twist you have to swap in a couple of black notes to get it to sound right. but you will learn that later"

        "answer": "there are 2 ways to be introduced to black keys. let's start by staying in the key of C. play the first 5 notes, up and down, c,d,e,f,g,f,e,d,c. this is part of the \"key of C\", specifically the key of C major. actually, it's all 7 notes all the way up. c,d,e,f,g,a,b,c. but let's just look at the first 5-- c,d,e,f,g. try JUST c, e, and g, all together at the same time. that's a chord. the name of that chord is C major. it is like your home chord in the key of C. ok great. now, plot twist, let's try a black note. instead of E, play the black note to the left of it instead (that note is called \"E flat\" which is written as E\u266d or Eb if you don't have the flat symbol handy... whenever i type Eb it means \"E flat\") ..... so any time you would have played E, play Eb instead. so going up the first 5 notes of the C major scale but switching in Eb instead, you get C, D, Eb, F, G. and back down, G, F, Eb, D, C. you'll notice it has a darker sound, like \"sad\" basically. this is called C minor. try the chord, C, Eb, G. that is a \"C minor\" chord. the C minor scale going all the way up is usually C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C. but the top part of the scale has a few different options that come into play that we'll worry about once we start seeing them actually in songs. mess around with the notes in C minor a little bit, especially the first 5 notes. for a challenge, see if you can figure out \"the ants go marching 1 by 1\", which is a kids song in a minor key. hint: you will need to include notes all the way down to the G below your root C. hint: the word \"march\" will be on C, and the word \"one\" will be on Eb. let me know if you can figure this out"

        "question": "I dont understand how people identify time signatures in almost all music (pop, rock, jazz, etc, etc). I play classical music, and i think the system is a bit different, but im not sure. Would you care explaining a little about that?",
        "answer": "i think it's the same step 1 is, find the beat. so as the music is going, see where you would tap your foot or nod your head, or wave your conducting wand. in most songs, this is pretty easy to find. of course you could always make crazy songs where you can't find it, but in Most songs you can find it. however, in most songs you can also do it twice as slow (or half as fast) if you want. in some songs, it is at just a certain tempo that you're almost not sure whether to tap the beat at one speed or twice as fast. this is ok, any piece of music can be written in multiple ways, you could set the tempo twice as fast and write all the notes as half the values and it would mean the same thing. but in most songs, it is reasonably clear where the foot-tap is. and i will go a step further to say that most music usually has these beats grouped together in groups of 2, 4, 8, etc. the way most music is written on paper is in groups of 4 beats, with bar lines dividing the bars (or 'measures'). most music uses 4 beats per bar. that being said it is really up to you to decide where the begining of the bars should be. but i think in most music there is a clear answer. to learn how to detect other time signatures besides 4/4, just start finding examples of them and then you will get better at hearing them. but when songs use 3-based time signatures, it can often be represented in multiple ways, many of which actually still heavily involve 4s. 2s, 3s, and 4s, are used all the time in music. it is very rare that music consistently uses a 5 or 7 pattern all the way through. usually when time signatures like 5 or 7 happen, it tends to be only once, and then goes back to 4. it is quite common for songs to need to add an extra beat or half a beat here and there, particularly at the end of the chorus or at the end of a section. this is accomplished by having 1 bar that is a different time signature. it is much more rare to have a song that entirely is based on a 5 pattern or a 7 pattern or another higher odd number. i'm not sure if that answers your question actually, but i think my most important point is that most music is in groups of 2, 4, and 8. and the way that is most commonly written on paper is with 4 beats per bar, and the time signature is called \"4/4\" (actually the first number is written above the second number but that's not easy to type here) the top or first number represents how many beats per bar. the bottom (or second) number is supposed to tell you what kind of a note gets the beat. so 4/4 should technically mean there are 4 beats in a bar and a 'quarter' note gets 1 beat. i realize there are holes in this system and many time signatures really can't be analyzed quite this way but that is the way the idea is supposed to work"

(right now I play drum kit and tenor drums, so I know how rhythms work but I don't know how to form cool chords and stuff like that). Do you have any suggestions of any resources or things that I could do to learn some more theory or learn how to play some common chords and stuff?",
        "answer": "i don't know what every one really means by 'music theory,' it is a phrase that people use here in the questions over and over again, in a way that doesn't quite make any sense to me. but the best way to learn music, in my opinion, is by doing it and experiencing it, and experimenting. you can make many theories that way, and i don't know if that counts as music theory but it should, because they are theories you have about music"

I'm just curious if this ever actually happened, that you made a complete, finished recording but ultimately decided not to post it?",
        "answer": "no, it seems like that could never happen. that strategy is kind of a paradox. because if i finish it, that means i tried my best the whole way and finished it. which means i definitely can release it. but the reason the strategy was in place is so i don't start second guessing the song choice early on in production. it helps me suspend disbelief and just give it a try. it is a strange paradoxical strategy, and ultimately lost some validity after 'california' because at that point i firmly established a weekly song schedule and announced it publicly. and i wouldn't exactly have time to do an entire song and then abandon it. so when i chose the second song i pretty much knew i was locked into it, even though i might have wanted to abandon it"

        "answer": "i guess just start with songs where it's really obvious. and then get a feel for what it means. then you will be able to figure other songs out. although i don't know, i've never had trouble with it, and i know many adults who still assume songs are in the key of the first chord, even when it seems obvious to me that that's not really the key. i don't really know why some people get this easily and others don't. it's kind of like seeing a house and knowing whether you are looking at it from the side or the front. i don't know how to really explain that to someone"

        "question": "Got any tips for \"soloing over chord changes\"? Pretty much all the videos/tutorials for this kind of thing I've seen online are all just saying \"use this mode over this scale degree\" and/or \"highlight the chord tones.\" Which, yea, that works... But, I don't really like looking at playing music in this kind of way. Whenever I improvise/solo I try to base what I'm playing around the main melody (kind of like a 'theme and variation' type of thing). I think when you're improvising, you shouldn't be thinking about scales and stuff, you should be thinking about the melody and harmony of the song. But, honestly, looking for work as a musician, being able to improvise off of a lead sheet is a good skill to have. I know there's a lot of gigs out there where you just kind of flip through the 'Real Book' and take turns comping/soloing over whatever song you happen to turn the page to. If somebody put a piece of sheet music in front of you that you've never hear d or pla yed before, how would you put together a solo that sounds good/interesting to you? Can you sight read the melody, but instead of playing the melody you're reading, come up with a variation of that melody on the spot as you're reading it for the first time? That seems really difficult.",
        "answer": "i think that's a great strategy i agree fully there are a couple of strategies. when you start to know a lot of songs, you start to recognize where a song is going and what it's doing, especially if it's a relatively 'normal' type of song. Look ahead, like to the whole line, and you should be able to get an idea of what's happening, at least if it's anything reasonably 'normal' going on. it should jump out at you. the more songs you know and the more experience you have, the easier this will be. But some songs might be more unexpected, experimental, and you might not be as sure where they're going. So if things start to feel uncertain, that's where you have to just start to zoom in slightly closer, and only look at 2 bars. worst case scenario, you JUST look at the one chord, and then just use the 'available notes' in a technical way. But usually you should be able to zoom out to AT LEAST 2 chords, or hopefully more. and the farther you zoom out, the better an idea you should get of what's going on. but let's say it's worst case and you really aren't sure where things are going and you are just looking at 1 chord, i still think 'scales' are not quite the right way to look at it. Just be aware of what the good notes usually are, and sort of rank them. The real good notes will vary depending on the context of the song obviously, and if you really know the song this will change everything, but as you said you are looking for tricks to use when you really don't know the context and all you have is a chord symbol staring you in the face. just sort of rank the notes. and there are all kinds of clues that will change things. so let's say the chord you're looking at is Fmaj7. well even still you can look at context. is the song in C, or in F? that will usually change the context. but on Fmaj7 your strongest notes are going to be E, A, and C. next probably G. If the chord is Cmin7, your strong notes are going to be Eb, then G, then Bb. again, context will always change this, but these are sort of the technical best options for when you really don't understand the context, for whatever reason (like if it's just a strange song doing a disorienting thing). for dominant 7th chords, there are a million zillion contexts for those chords, so you're really gonna have to know the song to figure out what's going on there, but your guaranteed available notes for example on G7 would be B and F. beyond that, anything else is kind of risking it, because 7th chords can be in all kinds of crazy contexts. sometimes specifics will be added. so let's say if it says G9 (which means G7 with a 9 on it) then you've got B, F, and A for sure. almost even favor A, because if the writer wrote G9, that must mean the A note is important. so just go for that note. if it's G7b9 then you'll be fine with B, F, and Ab. Zooming out a little bit more to a 3 chord sequence, things get clearer. since you mentioned the real book, I'll mention certain things that would occur there. if you're in Cmaj and you see D-7, G7, Cma7, you should really be looking at that whole figure altogether. basically what that figure means is \"we're coming in for a normal landing on Cmaj.\" so just, i dunno, just get used to stuff you can play over that. don't think about the chords individually, think about coming for a landing on Cmaj at the designated time. your F note is going to be in the running for the entire time BEFORE the landing, and when the landing hits you will want to be on E, G, perhaps B, maybe D. prior to the landing you will want to be using notes like D, F, also G, A, etc.. Looking at the case of a minor key version of the same thing, the familiar pattern (again speaking in terms of the real book) would be something like Dmin7b5, G7b9, Cmin. again, this means \"coming in for a landing on Cmin\"... resolving to C minor is a little bit more interesting, and a bit more crazy things are usually possible. Ab note will feature prominently BEFORE the landing, and you will want to land on G, Eb, perhaps D if it's a Cmin9 specifically, etc. before the resolution, B, D, F, also Eb, Bb should all be fine. When a G7 resolves to Cmin in the key of Cmin, that is an especially strong case of \"not all notes behave equally\" -- this is really always true, and again that's why i don't like to use scales because scales implies that all notes are equal. and that's really not true. it's like characters in a movie. sure all the characters are there, but they all have different personalities, have different roles to play, and are featured with different levels of prominence. Again, in general when improvising, always zoom out as much as possible and try to gather a sense of where the landing points are, identify when it's getting to where it's going. usually you can tell pretty clearly by zooming out, and it gets easier the more experience you have. If you have a clear idea of where the thing is going by the end of the line, or by the beginning of the next line, you can really lean back and go wherever you want to go in the meantime, because you know very clearly when it has to get to where it has to go, and it will feel fine. it's like going down a staircase. you can do as many backflips as you want and you don't even have to touch any of the stairs as long as you land at the bottom of the stairs at the right time"

        "question": "Hi! So I just started learning guitar a couple months ago, and I'm still very much a beginner. One thing I'm trying to do to get a better \"ear\" for music is to pick out little patterns and phrases and stuff that catches my attention. There's this one thing that I hear all the time... I heard that one Charlie Puth song, One Call Away, on the radio today. Towards the end of the song (starting at around 2:19 in the album version, not the music video) when he does like a stripped down, variation of the chorus he sings the line \"nothing on me\" and he adds this little twist that makes it sound different than the other choruses in the song. Like he adds some kind of extra chord or something. I'm drawing a blank on other specific songs I've heard something almost exactly like this, but I know it's something I hear very often in a lot of music, especially pop and R&B type stuff. I can't seem to figure out exactly what's going on though, or what the little cho rd varia tion thing is. Can you maybe help me out on this?",
        "answer": "F7. song is in key of Db, so that means it's a 3 dominant7 (going to Bbmin, or 6min) you're right, very common, very standard. very simple useful tool, been used since just about the beginning of time. but not everyone always knows how to use it. that's great news for you, if you learn how to use it. this is off the subject but bruno mars loves this chord and uses it all the time. (i.e. bullet right \"Through\" my brain). very common chord, again, will always be useful no matter what year it is, even more useful during time periods where no one seems to be using it. because it always works. and knowing how to use it will be to your advantage because like i said not everyone always knows how to use it"

Do you do anything like this? Do I have to go back and relearn the proper name for each chord?",
        "answer": "yes the only reason to know names of chords is to communicate with other musicians about what you're doing, particulaly when working together. so the next time you're working with another musician, especially if that chord comes up, you could say, 'hey what do you call this chord? i call it blah blah' and they might say 'oh i think most people call that blah blah' so now you might try calling it that the next time you are in a collaborative or working setting, and when you are by yourself you can continue to call it what you want. OR they might say 'oh wow, i never had a name for that chord, i like the name you gave it, i think i will start calling it blah blah also'"

        "question": "Hey Bill, you keep an audio journal. I am interested in keeping a journal, but I'm torn between audio and text. On one hand, audio is extremely easy to /create/. On the other hand, text is much easier to /manipulate/. For example, easily skipping back and forth, seeing context, and (most important!) search. Right now, I use speech to text on my phone, but I have to edit it because it's fairly inaccurate. So, I want to ask, why did you choose audio? How do you deal with the inefficiencies of audio manipulation?",
        "answer": "i didn't. i originally chose text the way i do it is i just talk to the thing for hundreds and thousands of hours over the course of many years, being excited about the fact that i can one day cut it together tightly with captions and graphics to actually make it interesting, but keep kicking that project down the road year after year while still recording more and more audio on a regular basis. then right after i get a big youtube hit i decide i can let that ride for a moment and get the journal edits project started once and for all. so i go through about 7000 clips and edit together the last 5 years worth of material, which takes 3 months, meanwhile my general audience thinks i'm 'dead' and have 'quit', then finally once i release the journals on a brand new page containing the journals all the way up until the date i started the editing, people look at this brand new content and asked why i 'stopped' after the latest journal date, which is not the date that i stopped at all, but rather the date that i started the entire editing process. then a year and a half later when i finally try to do another round of editing/releasing, again i find that it's taking up all of my time and i can't get to regular videos/music. and people still ask why i 'stopped' doung journals even while i am editing and releasing them, and they also ask when the next main project is which i still haven't gotten to because i've been doing journal edits. i'm not sure if that answers your question"

I know you want to write the parts in the range the singer is most comfortable singing.. but in terms of the specific voicings, are there voicings that you think work well on piano, but not so much with voice (or vice versa)? I guess, in general, im curious if you approach voicing harmony differently for different instruments? Would you write a vocal harmony differently then a horn arrangement, etc? Or do the same techniques apply across the board?",
        "answer": "it's pretty simple. i think it's important to start simple. only put a harmony on like 1 thing. like maybe that special line in the 2nd verse. only add 1 harmony note. i think it's ususlly pretty clear what to add. but the only way to know is just try it. one important thing to remember is keep the mix lower than the lead. put it on loop and select your harmony tracks and slide them down until it sounds right. harmonies mostly will work best in the 'chord range' which is usually like middle C and above. if your lead vocal is male and in the mid-low range (like below middle C) just remember that your harmonies will usually want to be higher. then just try stuff and see what works"

        "question": "Hey, I asked a question a little while ago about vocal harmonies. Another thing I'm curious about, that I forgot to mention in my other question, is doubling notes in different instruments. For simplicity sake, say you have a good old ii-V-I in C. If the bass player is playing the roots, D to G to C, then on piano I won't want to play the chords starting on those same roots. So I'd maybe play FACE, FABE, then EABD. Okay. So, then say I want to add maybe a 4 part vocal harmony over that, or a 4 part horn arrangement. Would I want that arrangement to have the same extensions that I'm doing on piano (Dm9, G9/13, Cmaj6/9)? Is it a good strategy to take the same notes the piano is playing, but just voice them in a different order/inversion? Do I want to double all those same notes? I know there's not set \"rules\" or anything. And you can write horn arrangements/vocal arrangements in any way that sounds good to you. But I'm new to this kind of thing, and ju st inter ested in any tips or \"strategies\" you may have.",
        "answer": "doubling notes is fine and nice you have to specify which octave. chords behave differently texturally depending on which octave, especially when we're talking about arranging which instruments play what playing what melody, is there a melody or are they playing their own melody usually i think you'll find when arranging for a band, you're usuallly going to want to not go too far beyond what a single piano player could play with 2 hands. (or even one.) Doubling notes is fine and great. i think if you were to take all the notes that anyone is playing at any given time, octave specific, and diagram them on the piano, i think it should really usually only be between like 4 and 9 notes. but you'll have to try and see. but if you have multiple chordal instruments, horns, voices, whatever, i think it would be a bad strategy to try to put everyone on different notes on purpose. on that Dmin7, everyone should gravitate toward that F note, and/or the A and C notes, right around the middle range, and when theres more players just be gentle and let those notes just sing and glow as each instrument approaches those voicings in whatever way their instrument works best-- so ideally you should get a nicely layered sound that just sounds like a 2-4 note chord that sounds like a very healthy blend, where all the most important notes are being played by approximately 2 and a half people. but you'll just have to try and see"

Since you mentioned that it would be boring to just hear you speak/ramble on about your life.

Thank you very much for your time.",
        "answer": "there are 3 worlds you may find yourself in when playing piano, with regard to which hand does what. world 1 is where your left hand plays the bass notes (one note at a time) your right hand plays the chords, and you are singing the melody (or someone else is singing/playing the melody. World 2 is where you already have a bass player playing the bass notes, and you have to take care of the chords and the melody. world 3 is where you are in a band where someone else is playing the bass, and someone else is playing the melody, and you are only playing the chords. so in other words, we have 3 different elements- bass, chords, and melody. and depending on the situation you are playing in, you may be taking care of a different number of those things. each situation requires totally different things"

        "question": "How does one figure out the time signature of a song? I know what time signatures are but I have no idea how to figure them out in songs that are more than just like one instrument (so most songs)",
        "answer": "step 1 is, find the beat. so as the music is going, see where you would tap your foot or nod your head, or wave your conducting wand. in most songs, this is pretty easy to find. of course you could always make crazy songs where you can't find it, but in Most songs you can find it. however, in most songs you can also do it twice as slow (or half as fast) if you want. in some songs, it is at just a certain tempo that you're almost not sure whether to tap the beat at one speed or twice as fast. this is ok, any piece of music can be written in multiple ways, you could set the tempo twice as fast and write all the notes as half the values and it would mean the same thing. but in most songs, it is reasonably clear where the foot-tap is. and i will go a step further to say that most music usually has these beats grouped together in groups of 2, 4, 8, etc. the way most music is written on paper is in groups of 4 beats, with bar lines dividing the bars (or 'measures'). most music uses 4 beats per bar. that being said it is really up to you to decide where the begining of the bars should be. but i think in most music there is a clear answer. to learn how to detect other time signatures besides 4/4, just start finding examples of them and then you will get better at hearing them. but when songs use 3-based time signatures, it can often be represented in multiple ways, many of which actually still heavily involve 4s. 2s, 3s, and 4s, are used all the time in music. it is very rare that music consistently uses a 5 or 7 pattern all the way through. usually when time signatures like 5 or 7 happen, it tends to be only once, and then goes back to 4. it is quite common for songs to need to add an extra beat or half a beat here and there, particularly at the end of the chorus or at the end of a section. this is accomplished by having 1 bar that is a different time signature. it is much more rare to have a song that entirely is based on a 5 pattern or a 7 pattern or another higher odd number. i'm not sure if that answers your question actually, but i think my most important point is that most music is in groups of 2, 4, and 8. and the way that is most commonly written on paper is with 4 beats per bar, and the time signature is called \"4/4\" (actually the first number is written above the second number but that's not easy to type here) the top or first number represents how many beats per bar. the bottom (or second) number is supposed to tell you what kind of a note gets the beat. so 4/4 should technically mean there are 4 beats in a bar and a 'quarter' note gets 1 beat. i realize there are holes in this system and many time signatures really can't be analyzed quite this way but that is the way the idea is supposed to work"

I am going to swim, do YOU (someone) want to come? It's ME (YOU; bill) do YOU want to come to my house? I just end my homework. WE (YOU; bill and other people, or just someone else) are going to the carnival, are YOU (someone, or more people that you are talking to) coming? end of the examples. ok, those are the examples, I hope it help you, but I (the one that wrote this) don't know if you (bill) were talking about this, or you mean something else. whatever, bye bill!",
        "answer": "right, thanks, i know all that already. it seems you didn't really read the question, which was about which pronoun to use when talking to yourself. which is a situation when you ARE the person you are talking to. which makes you both \"i\" \"you\" and \"we\" all at the same time"

Do you have an overarching concept or vision that guides your work? Zappa called this 'conceptual continuity' and it was a huge aspect to his music. I've also noticed this a lot in Prince's music (a lot of songs are self-referential or reference other songs, and there's certain little recurring rhythmic patterns that he uses, and certain ideas, like sexuality and spirituality, get revisited often). Dwayne Thomas Jr., a great bass player, takes it a step further and says that you should write down your own artistic vision and read it daily... So do you have your own, specific vision or 'conceptual continuity'? It doesn't have to be something that is clearly evident to fans, but just something in your own mind that your working towards, or kind of ties everything together for you?",
        "answer": "there wasn't, until i realized that in a finite life-time i had better start acknowledging one. in other words, it is tempting to want to do a million different types of things under different names and be the best everything separately, but at a certain point i realized that in just 1 lifetime it's going to be much better if i just admit that i'm just one person. which was the kind of breakthrough that led to me getting a site, settling on one name, and adopting a \"more is more\" strategy of choosing which things to put on the site"

        "answer": "i don't really have any fast techniques. usually it just involves asking a lot of questions and using process of elimination to eventually narrow it down. you have to be patient, it can take a while. but in the past few years i've succeeded at it enough times that i am confident that the answer is always there if you wait for it. some examples of questions you might want to be asking, let's say for example you have your chorus and now you're trying to figure out what the verse figure is that comes before it, examples of questions would be-- does it want the same chord for or different chord form? in many songs it is a no brainer that the verse and chorus use the same form, and that's fine. some songs it is supposed to be different. so first we want to narrow it down and see which one feels right for this song. often you get a clear answer yes or no. just a lot of narrowing it down. another thing which SOMETIMES works is see what goes well AFTER the chorus, like see what would be good for a second verse. but you're still going to be left with the puzzle of what will do best as the first verse, especially if the first verse starts the song. i have no good tricks for this, just spend time narrowing it down and trying things and seeing if they work. and i've gotten this now enough times that i always know there is a solution, so i know to be patient with it and keep asking questions"

        "question": "I was watching the Joy of Painting the other day. I don't know how familiar you are with Bob Ross' videos... but his approach to creating art is just unbelievable. And insanely inspiring. In almost every painting he'll say something like \"now it's time to make a big decision\" then without seemingly even thinking about it he'll just paint a giant fucking tree or mountain or something right in the middle of the foreground, that takes up a huge chunk of the painting, even covering up things he's already painted in the background... and it winds up working beautifully. I know so many artists, writers, musicians etc who are so meticulous and who spend more time thinking about what they're gonna do, then they do actually doing the thing. Like when I'm writing a song... I scrutinize every single phrase.. is that the best rhythm? Should I use a different chord to harmonize this note? Should this be louder or softer, should I use this effect, etc. But if I w ere Bob Ross, I would just throw a big old wrench into the song on a whim, and make it work. ('This is your world, and in your world, notes can live wherever you want them to. Let's put this note here. That's nice. Let's put this chord here'). Do you think that you're able to approach your content in the 'Bob Ross way'?",
        "answer": "extremely well the important thing to remember here is he is doing a regular scheduled TV show with firm time limits. this is one of the gorgeous things about a regular content schedule, with time limits. things get done. and after doing so many shows of exactly the same length, you become very good at knowing exactly what is gonna work in that time frame. you know exactly how much time you have to do the sky. you know exactly when you have to decide on your mountains. you know exactly when to get to the tree highlights. and exactly when you'll have a moment to tell a brief story about some crazy shit you've seen in alaska"

        "question": "thanks for the help earlier! i'm the one learning the peter gabriel song Here Comes the Flood. (i'm not asking about theory btw hahahaha, please don't move to space, we like having you here.) what i'm trying to learn is the full, accurate piano part in the original key, from the Shaking The Tree version. i don't think i communicated my questions very well though, or at all, so i'll try again. i have experience in percussion, but also some guitar and mandolin, learning with tabs and by ear - i'm the one that thinks strings sound soapy. but i can JUST BARELY read music at all. i am teaching myself piano, and how to read music. right now my ears are ahead of my fingers and feet, which are all MILES ahead of what i can actually read. there's a lot of \"music language\" that i've been exposed to but don't really understand yet. i want to learn this stuff so i can play and communicate with others better, and to be able to write down things i make up. my strategy is: A) have fun learning songs that i like as accurately as i can, by ear. B) learn to read using beginner music books and get frustrated because i can only read things like hot cross buns so far. (maybe a tad more advanced than that.) it was fairly equal a month ago but now i spend 95% of the time i play on A and 5% on B. so, i haven't progressed on reading much. that's problem 1. problem 2 is: i think i have a pretty good ear. BUT i sometimes hit a limit: when it gets to be 5 or 6 or more keys pressed at the same time, it all starts to sound like One Big Thing and i have trouble distinguishing the notes, especially low ones. (keep in mind that i can't NAME the notes/chords from hearing them, i can just copy what i hear after hunting around a bit.) i know some musicians are able to identify notes in big chords really easily and accurately, and it seems almost like they were just born with that ability, which is kind of scary, because maybe tha t means that i was born with the abilities i have and can't upgrade them. so my questions are: 1) will my ears develop the more i use them? 2) is learning music going to be a bit frustrating no matter what, given my situation, or could i be doing something better? or just have a better attitude lol. do you have any advice???? thanks, x",
        "answer": "i think if you keep using a pause and hunt strategy, (make sure you are using a local copy of the file, not streaming. if it's streaming like on youtube or something you're never gonna be able to unpause-pause as quickly as you need to) if you keep using the pause and hunt strategy for more and more songs, you will learn more and more and there will be less and less things that confuse you, and less and less things that fall outside your familiar classification system. if there are any chords or notes you are wondering about, i will be able to tell you if you show me where you heard it yes it sounds like the right thing for you to do, and it sounds like you are doing great"

        "answer": "i think of F#sus to mean the notes F#, B, C#. which is used in the verses on the word \"do\" (supposed to \"do\"), but it is never used in the chorus. the one in the chorus is different in that it contains E. there are many names for this chord, including F#7sus which i understand may seem on paper to be similar to F#sus, but whether or not it contains the E i think makes a big difference in this case"

        "question": "Hi Bill. Maybe you can help point me in a good direction for this. I know it's a topic you brought up in a few of your reality vids. So, I have a seemingly endless supply of unfinished songs. Some of them are just little bits and pieces, some of them are nearly finished. But I can probably count on one hand the number of songs that I actually finished and recorded this year. I want to finish my songs. I want a nice base of full, completed, solid recordings. But I LOVE to write, much more than record. The ideas come faster than I can keep up with. I have multiple binders filled with sketched out charts and I don't how many rough audio demos. At what point do I need to say, ok stop writing, and finish what you've got? The issue is if I finish what I got that would mean going a very long time without writing, which is my favorite thing to do. I know it's different for me than you, because I don't have a fanbase awaiting my next move and deman ding mor e content... But I know this is something you've had to deal with. I'm sure you've been asked this a lot too. But any advice you have would be awesome.",
        "answer": "are you kidding? you are exactly me update you are exactly me in 2013 there are layers and layers to this issue. without telling my entire life story (again) i don't think there is any quick way to say it. i want to explain my entire experience with this, because your situation sounds so similar to mine, but i probably won't be able to stop myself from explaining every little detail. and i know i've done it several times before on the questions page, and i think most of the important points are covered in the reality section also. but there is a whole jungle of promising solutions, and additional setbacks, and more solutions, and this is an ongoing windstorm that i am still dealing with today. there are a lot of strategies for this. seriously. if you want to know more i can explain"

        "question": "Howdy Bill! So I'm thinking about buying a bass to toy around with. I've been playing piano and playing in a band for a while. So I'm familiar with how to write bass lines, and how the bass fits in with the overall harmony/rhythm of a tune... But I really wanna learn how to actually play the thing! Couple questions for you... Bass strings? What are the advantages/disadvantages of round wound vs flat wound strings? Do they sound different, or is just a different feel to them when playing? Also, what are the advantages/disadvantages of using heavy gauge strings vs light gauge strings (different sound or just different feel)? One more question, how important do you think it is to learn \"proper\" right-hand technique? I dabble on guitar a bit, so I think I can play the bass lines just fine.. but I want to make it sound good, which means more than just hitting the right note at the right time. Would you recommend watching videos showing right hand fingerin g techni que and all that kind of stuff?",
        "answer": "you'll never believe this, but i'm actually not the right person to answer those questions. maybe in 5 years i will be it's most important to make sure you're not hurting yourself. if something hurts, stop and relax and try to make sure you are doing everything at the most natural angles. try not to have your wrist bent too much. this especially goes for your left hand. this ultimately means you will have to set your strap really high. but i think if you are serious about the instrument you will put it high. this unfortunately could mean trouble with the fashion police if you happen to be living in the year 2000. but otherwise it should be fine maybe. i just use a regular finger technique. it's not that hard to figure out. but i guess there are a lot of different ways you could do it"

But I would like to know what step 2 is (I have some staff paper). I know how to read sheet music (I know the notes that correspond to the lines/spaces of the treble and bass clef), and I know how to read rhythmic notation... But I have a hard time actually just sight reading and playing a piece fluently without having to take a second to figure out each note/rhythm pattern. (Maybe i'm skipping a couple of steps in your step-by-step system)",
        "answer": "just go to the store and get a book of songs and start practicing. read just the melodies if you want. do it with a metronome. set it slow enough so that you can do it. maybe even be aware of you handicap compared to the original tempo, for example maybe 75% is reasonable. so if the song is marked 100bpm, set your metronome to 75. or maybe even 50 if you need to. and practice looking ahead. that's the key to the game"

        "question": "possibilities scare me. each one of them comes with a -and more- different future(s). nobody can see them all, which makes the first move even more scarier. it's where you become the aphelion itself, the furthest point from the sun. you don't know what will happen if you begin your journey. stars may burn you, you can get lost in emptiness of nothing, everything may be terrible. even if the end is bad, it's existence is relaxing since it means everything is temporary and nothing lasts forever but when you ARE the aphelion, the end is far away as much as your dreams shining bright like the sun. there is an infinite space of possibilities between you and your biggest fears, as much as everything you have ever wished and everything you have gone through is for you to be at that point. there are so many ways to start changing your world and the world, to write, to tell stories and the universes i imagined, so many words... i don't have the guts to start all over (again). you lived similar yet different things in music, at least that's what i understand. i really need your help. i can't get focused on just one project, inspiration and creativity are like my curse and i give a deep meaning in every damn thing around me, i want to write about all of them. i always try to calculate the chaos of probabilities in my mind, i of course can't. this makes me leave everything i started unfinished and like if i am in a vicious circle, i find myself in that aphelion point AGAIN to start another project after the other one i only completed the first layer of. i begin to be afraid of taking the pen in my hands that is basically my life. how did you do that? how did you dare to make the first move and just make music?",
        "answer": "the deeper you get into that situation (your situation) you'll notice the prize gets higher and higher for just doing 'something' and finishing it. so shrink the project size and lower the bar until it is completely manageable. do a short thing and it doesn't matter what it is. then save it and date it and do your next thing"

        "question": "Regarding the french augmented sixth chord: The chord is used in cadences. In the key of c, the French augmented sixth chord would be Ab-C-D-F# leading to the 'clean V' (as I call it), G-B-D-G, or even better, the Gsus4. The most common use of the augmented sixth chord (google it if you're into nerdy music theory) is the German augmented sixth chord; Ab-C-Eb-F# (in the key of c), that then leads to the cadential dominant 6/4 chord (G-C-E-G) that leads to the 'clean V' and finally to the tonic of c. As a professional classical musician, the German aug. sixth chord is by far my favorite chord (in cadences), so I guess my question is; now that you know about it and you're good at writing catchy jingles, would you consider using it in your music?",

        "question": "Doesnt a tritone substitution basically mean just moving a half step down into the chord? Like in C, you'd play a Db instead of G to move to C. But I thought moving a chord either a half step up or a half step down to the 'target chord' was a trick that works no matter what chord your playing? Like if you playing a blues song in C and for the little V-IV-I turnaround you hit a G#7 before going to the G7... would that be a tritone substitution too (the 5th of G is D, tritone of D is G#)?",
        "answer": "i think it's supposed to be a 7th chord with a tritone in it Db7 instead of G7 in this school of thinking, 7th chords descending chromatically is a legit and normal thing, just like 7th chords moving down a fifth / up a fourth is considered legit. in either case, the internal tritone harmony (B and F notes in a G7 chord) can be seen as moving down chromatically regardless. i think tritone substitution refers to any time you have a 7th chord with the tritone harmony in it (like a G7 chord contains the notes B and F) and then you switch the bass note for a Db note, which essentially makes a Db7 chord instead, because the core notes (B, F) are the same. Additionally, any other notes you were using in the chord can usually translate to the other, and usually a light-dark or dark-light transformation occurs. for example if you had G7 with 9, 13, (the 'light' notes) and you flip the bass to Db, and leave all the same notes, they become the 'dark' notes on the Db7 so it becomes Dbaug7#9. This whole line of thinking is generally only applicable in the school of thinking that the notes B and F with G in the bass should resolve to C and E, with C in the bass. or B and F with Db in the bass resolve to F# and A# with F# in the bass. so why not switch"

        "question": "i tried to find everything i've ever written; stories, fictions, novel ideas, lyrics, text roleplays, one-shots, prompts, poems and even the stupid weird, you know, \"things\" from primary school. i gathered all of them and checked them over to see if they are useful, to take the good ones and finish projects. after all this time i didn't write anything but a scenario for a school play, probably because it destroyed my whole life and i gave everything i had to it (i thought it would be a simple and small play since we do it for school but since i always want to do everything perfect, i somehow kinda became the director and wrote 13000 fucking words, with history researching, songs, stage decor, costumes, lighting etc it took 7 damn months of my life and i even fucking translated a nurse's journal and a soldier's war letters in Ottoman Turkish which was simply Arabic, a language that i don't know, for play to be realistic), i hoped reading m y old wo rks would make me do something. it didn't. i don't know why i stopped doing what i do best. maybe i was tired and no matter what i do, i can't encourage myself to start again but i have to. it's not about inspiration, i am always creative but sometimes power of imagination is too much and i feel like i'm going insane. i want to write about whole universe(s) but i can't, and possibilities every little thing creates... so this is the situation. i am sorry, it's long but i needed to tell. and the question is: should i complete my old projects, creating in a small scale like you said or should i go after the one i have always wanted to do which can change my life by starting all over? there is another choice, i can use my good works for beginning that big project but i'm so fucking afraid that i'll never be able to finish it.",
        "answer": "ah, you are drowning in infinity. this will probably be confusing and hopeless for a little while longer, just keep brainstorming and thinking of different possibilities.... just when you think there's no solution, you'll realize that you are actually safe on solid ground, and instead of drowning it's actually just raining infinity. so just get some cups"

        "question": "Hey, so I think you say that you usually write the melody and harmony of a song together... Just wondering where rhythm fits into this? I guess a melody has its own implied rhythm. But do you usually write/record drums and bass last? Do you often switch it up, like a cool little rhythmic pattern pops up in your head and you think \"oh, that needs a melody\"?",
        "answer": "melody has rhythm drums and bass are not necessarily part of the writing. sometimes there will be hints at what's supposed to happen, but writing the song usually does not include deciding exactly what everyone is going to play. when it comes time to do the song, then the players (which all happen to be me) use their best judgement for how to do the song. it's like making a movie or tv show. the script mainly has dialogue, and some basic info about scenes and sets. but the writers don't build the sets, and they are not making decisions about every little item that goes everywhere on the set. that is done by the set designers, but they are doing it based on the way the script seems to imply it should be, even though the details may not be written in the script. they are using their judgement based on the what they can infer from the script the vast majority of songwriting for me is based on the melody/lyric, but a small number of times i have found a certain groove or chord sequence that i think is basis for a song, so it is entered into the song list. i don't recall if any of those have ever made it to the next step"

        "question": "How come when I listen to \"Tell Me Something Good\" (the Chaka Khan song) I always lose track of where the beat is? I can tap my foot to the 'pulse', but when I try to count out the beat (1-2-3-4) I always get thrown off, like I'll think I know what to call \"beat 1\" but as the song goes on it seems like where I was counting beat 1 gets off place.",
        "answer": "i've only heard that song a couple of times but if i recall correctly the verses have sort of a backwards groove, i believe the clav (funk keyboard) is playing downbeats, in a way you would expect upbeats to be played. so it might be easy to hear the verse backwards. the top of the chorus is \"Tell,\" and likely that part is easy to hear correctly. but the verse surely flipped you around. and the more you get to know the song from that perspective, the harder it will be to un-hear it that way"

        "question": "Are you happy with the length of hotewig? In sure it was tough to work on a project for almost a year, especially while getting so many questions about when the video will be done, why aren't you posting any videos, etc... ideally, would you have liked to make hotewig even longer and more detailed/inclusive? Or when you first stated working on the project did you kind of set a time limit for how long you wanted it to be (like you told yourself you wanted it to be around 20min or so)? Btw I love the video as is, and I don't mean to sound as if I'm criticizing it or anything like that. Just curious how the finished product compared to your early expectations in terms of detail and length.",
        "answer": "i was hoping it would be about 5 to 7 minutes, 10 maximum. but it turns out the history of the entire world is not a very short story. i was trying to shorten it as much as possible at every turn but it went beyond 10 minutes, and with each passing minute of writing i kept promising myself that it would absolutely not go longer than 12 minutes, 15 minutes, 17 minutes, etc etc. ... when i finished the script it was timed at 21:45. then over the course of the preliminary graphics design, i was making a lot of changes and cuts and managed to get it down to about 19. was very concerned that it was too long, not only for production's sake but also for the viewers' sake"

        "question": "So today was my second day of genetics in college. We have a flipped classroom format, so we read all the material and do the problems before we come to class, and then in class, we go over the problems. So, as required, I teach myself all this material and then go to class. And I sit there for one and a half hours, listening to at least one of my classmates screw up almost every question, discovering that some of them don't even know what 2^4 is. I mean, come on, Bill. Am I just wasting my time in school? I know that you at least went to high school (and partially to college, I think, I dunno), but you knew that (1) you learn better when you taught yourself and (2) you had nothing to gain from school. What do I do now? I mean, I've always loved school, but that was because it was easy for me. I never had to do anything because I always taught myself everything I needed to know. Now, though, I'm kind of yearning for a challenge: as you said, I wanna be somet hing, go somewhere, do something. I want things to change. None of this seems to be happening for my in school. Though I can't just drop out. What other choices do I have?",
        "answer": "nowadays there are many ways to learn. but one of the things that school/university can offer is it may help you get ahead in society, regardless of what is taught in class"

        "question": "Hey Bill. I am trying to make music, and I put in some synth chords and drums. Now I'm trying to add new instruments and sections to my song. I pick an instrument and write a harmony for it, record it, listen to it, and it sounds bad. I do this like 5-20 times before getting something that works with what I already have, and all this trying things and not having them work out makes me sad. Ergo, working on music tends to leave me sad instead of satisfied. What should I do?",
        "answer": "what about bass without hearing what you're doing, i can make some guesses. make sure something is doing the 'bass' -- that means, make sure there is something playing single notes in a low range (between 1 and 3 octaves below middle C). just try some things, you will soon learn what you want to do. but you need to be using that range, at least for some of the song (hopefully for like the 'main' parts of the song. or perhaps the whole time). also another thing i can suggest, don't be goal oriented in piling on instruments. and the main thing i would suggest is, make sure you know what the song is about before adding any instruments, or at the very latest you need to know what the song is about by the time you have added the second instrument. also there is a 90% chance your song should either have words associated with it in some prominent way, or if not it needs to be strongly associated with a video or story line. instruments are just nebulous sounds -- very powerful, but nebulous -- if you want to really get things done here, you will need something that makes sense to the front part of your brain. (words, concepts, characters, things you can identify like a cat or a dog, etc. that sort of thing) ... if you have that, then the instruments and sounds can work to their full effect, seemingly enhancing the power of those items in front. just some general hints from the way i usually look at things, although there are surely other ways to do it"

        "question": "Hi, I was the one who asked about Ryland by Julian Lage (on World's Fair). There are really quiet notes in the first and second measures of the song (if you are thinking of it in 6/8) starting on the sixth 8th note that goes A D A D A. And the next time it happens is on the down beat of the 4th measure and the notes are G E G E. There are other times it happens with different notes too. My first guess was that they were harmonics because some of them seem out of tune but I can't figure it out.",
        "answer": "i'm hearing different ones than you are mentioning, like the one that comes out most prominently is the top of bar 2 (in 6/8) there is a loud F note (out of key). this is a hammer-on, from the wrong half of the string. this only happens acoustically, and it happens worse when you are playing in the middle of the string (or in the high fret range). if you do a hammer-on, it vibrates the correct half of the string (which gives you the note you want) but also the back half of the string (to the left of your left hand). on electric, you usually wouldn't hear it. but unplugged, the 2 notes will be of equal volume if the note is near the middle of the string. so in this case it is exactly in the middle of the string (12th fret) so both sides resonate equally. on a fretless instrument i think this would be the same note, but because it's fretted instrument, the target point to press is actually on the right bar of the fret, not the left. but the reverse note is happening from the other side, from the bar on the left side of the fret. so it's a slightly shorter distance. so you'll get F instead of E. this is not the note that you mentioned, but it seems to be the loudest and most obvious one right from the very beginning. the reason it is particularly problematic is because he's hitting it harder, for groove's sake, since it's the downbeat of the bar. really to avoid this in an acoustic close-mic situation is you have to try not to hammer as hard with the left hand, and do more of the work with your right hand. the rest of the quiet out-of-tune notes i believe are also unwanted reverse hammer-ons, but as we get closer to the left (the head? neck? sorry don't really know guitar terms, i am not a guitar player) the reverse hammer-on would be quieter, and higher. wherever you do a hammer-on, the lower (longer) of the 2 notes will be louder. that's just my analysis. i'm not really a guitar player"

        "question": "I am looking at a piece of sheet music and it has 2 sets of quintuplet 16th notes, and a set of sextuplet 16th notes, all noted together as a triplet.. like there's 2 sets of 5 sixteenth notes with the little bracket and a 5 over each group, and then six sixteenth notes with a little bracket and a 6, and then over all 3 groups there's one long bracket with a 3... what is this mean? Ive never seen a tuplet inside of a tuplet before... How am I supposed to play that?",
        "answer": "tuplets actually have a hidden number. any time you see the \"3\" for triplet, it's actually shorthand for \"3:2\" which means '3 notes in the time there would normally be 2 of these.' when 5's and 6's are used, it can be ambiguous whether it means 5:2 or 5:4, but regardless it is easy to figure out by looking at the context. but the time under the triplet bracket should be divided in 3, and then each of those thirds divided into 5, 5, and 6. or, for a reasonable human, just play 16 (oh wow, just realized the strange implications of this) notes in that time .... So really all this is saying is, play it like 32nd notes (or 16ths, depending on whether the triplet bracket takes up a whole bar or half a bar, that you can discern by looking at what else is in the bar)... so yeah basically the only technical difference between this and 32nd notes is basically they are just asking you to play the first 10 notes slower by an extremely negligible and unnoticeable amount. unless of course the rest of the music is in triplets anyway, in which case it would be normal to divide it in 3's. a lot of questions here that the context will answer. such as the tempo, and what the notes are"

        "question": "Hey, I asked the question about that 5,5,6 triplet thing! So, the song is in 4/4 time (slower tempo, about 80bpm). The full measure is a dotted eighth, then a sixteenth note tied to a quarter note, then that 5,5,6, triplet thing. So that 5,5,6 triplet should take up 2 beats. So, it's like dividing 2 beats into 3 equal parts (3:2 quarter note triplet), then taking those 3 equal parts and dividing them again into 5,5, and 6 respectively? This piece also has several septuplets and pentuplets and all that kind of stuff... In general, what are some good ways to figure out how to hear/play this kind of timing? I can conceptualize it, and I think I understand how it works. But the challenge is like, okay, so how do I actually play 7 equally spaced hits over the span of 2 beats, or whatever? I can play 3:2 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 note triplets because I hear them used all the time, and can just play it without actually counting it out, i just know how it sounds.. Is it possi ble to be able to sight read these kind of weird tuplets/polyrhythms? Or is it something that you just have to hear each particular rhythm over and over again until it sinks in?",
        "answer": "so basically if you just played this as 32nd notes, no one would ever know the difference. we're talking about squeezing 16 notes into 2 beats at 80bpm. grouping it evenly in thirds as 5+5+6 is not really going to be distinguishible from even 16, from the listener's or player's perspective. i would ask the composer what the point was of writing it that way, and maybe they could give you some insight as to how it's played. sometimes composers like to showoff on the page how many crazy looking numbers they can put in, now i'm not suggesting that this composer would do such a thing! but it's worth a thought you could think of it as 4 sixteenth notes and 3 triplets, but slow it down a little bit so the middle click is halfway in between your 4th and 5th note no matter what year you live in or what country you go to, these types of complex mathematical exercises will be used in less than 1% of music. most often when complex number tuplets are used, (5, 7, etc) it is really only an approximation of something else, more musical perhaps. always check with the director or composer because they might be able to describe what they are looking for"

        "question": "Hi Bill! I'm learning piano, and I really love that funky synth sound. But sometimes I have hard time figuring out certain chords I hear (maybe cause the notes of a chord played on a synth blend together more than a piano chord?)... But I was wondering if you can help me out with this. In this song, could you tell me the voicing for the chord that plays around the 1:44 right after 'just can't wait no more'? Also those little chord hits that play around 2:44 right after 'baby I'm sure you would'? Here's the song. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVSfnXeYmtQ",
        "answer": "that's a closed Bmin7 voicing, but it might likely have been played as Amin7 and bent up, depending on whether the player prefers to pull down the bender first and bend up to the chord, or play the chord first lower and then raise the bender. so you could play G,A,C,E, and bend it up, or pull back the bender first and play A,B,D,F# and then bend it back to center. also important to mention that this tape is also running just a hair sharp Amin6. very densely, possibly doubled in octaves, because there is definitely high A (880), but the F#(the 6 note) seems to be coming from more than an octave below. and in between you surely would have your C and E. it's just really dense and thick. also drenched in vibrato. it's Amin6, which means it includes notes A, C, E, F#. intuition tells me that this sound is automatically doubled an octave, and it's a one handed 5-note voicing with A on both ends. left hand would be working the bender/vibrato wheels"

        "answer": "sure, you could think of it that way. any interval when stacked will eventually get back to the same note. 4ths are just reversed 5ths, so the circle of 4ths is really the same as the circle of 5ths. 6ths and 3rds are the reverse of each other if you flip the major/minor, so everything i said about major/minor thirds would basically be true for 6ths as well if you switch the major and minor. it's just the notes will be further apart because they will be in the next octave. major seconds get back to the same note after 6 notes, it's called the whole tone scale, and it is a cliche device for a 'flashback' sort of sound. minor 2nds is just the chromatic scale, and you get back to the same note after 12. 7ths are the inverse of 2nds, again with the major/minor reversed, just like 6ths vs 3rds"

But I downloaded your 'medium length' songs and was playing them on shuffle on my computer... And I could swear some of them worked perfectly being played back to back. Is this just my imagination? Or did you write any of your 'medium length' songs to purposefully go with other songs in a particular order?",
        "answer": "if there's any order to the songs, it would be the order they were written. which unfortunately is not preserved whatsoever in the recording, mainly because i can't record songs nearly as fast as i can write them, so i've always been hopelessly behind on recording, so i have to pick and choose. for example, 'new canaan' is really part of a series of 4 songs (well actually 5) but new canaan is the only one of those that has been recorded so far. 'future song' was written immediately after 'the song song' and i consider them sister tunes, but they were recorded 5 years apart"

So good.",
        "answer": "i think the original chart, as written in 2009, is posted on the expert page of this site. the song is mostly there, but some small revisions occured in 2012/13. the license plate line was a revision. i think the original line was \"not much for words and i'm not much for rhymes, but that don't mean i can't buy a coffee\" and i think there was a revision on that that went \"looks like a ?(some number) figure income town, but that don't mean i can't look around.\" and then the final revision, sometime in 2012 or 2013 was the license plate line. i was so happy with this line that this used to haunt me throughout 2013/14, whenever i would see a connecticut license plate i would be reminded of that line, and get burningly sad that that song hadn't been recorded yet, and no one had heard it. thankfully now it has, but there are many other songs of course, unrecorded, that still give me the same feeling"

But the way it's voiced, I think is something like ACEG(raw), ACDF#(flame), GBDF#(live),to GBCE(wire). I think that's pretty nifty! You got those 4 chords played in succession, but with very little movement between the voicings. That got me thinking. I know there are no rules when it comes to writing harmony, and you can do whatever you think sounds good.... but do you get Bonus Points if you keep the voicings as close as possible when changing chords? I think having chords that 'bounce around' can definitely work and sound good sometimes, but there's something extra satisfying and special about having as little movement as possible.",
        "answer": "this is a very standard chord sequence and harkens back to generations past that's normal, that's how it's supposed to be done those aren't bonus points, that is a passing grade that's true inverting your chords so they fit in the same range is normal, and healthy. it's like putting your meat and potatoes on the same plate"

        "question": "hey bill can you give me some advice? i have aspergers, and i have been discriminated A LOT for it, which totally wrecked my self esteem. trough out middle and high school i've been treated like i'm a fucking retard. so much that even I believed i was a retard. i refused to shut up about having aspergers / being autistic tho, because i want people to know who i am. when i was 21 i decided to turn things around and stop telling anyone i was autistic, and tell the people who knew / still tought i was, i told them that the diagnosis was not right. not because it wasnt right, i dont know it if it was right. but that diagnosis made people not treat me right, and refuse to listen to who i actually am because the assumed they already knew, because they had read an article about aspergers or something. so right now in my life hardly anyone knows i used to wear this label. it feels good because for once people will actually listen to who i am instead of assum e. BUT t he misconceptions about aspergers remain. even with new people in my life, some of these people still think autistic = retarded / incapable of anything except math. i feel bad because by shutting up about my diagnosis i am not helping other who still get discriminated. should i 'come out' again as having aspergers? so that people will know people with aspgergers actually all have a different personality that is build up of many layers just like everybody else?",
        "answer": "i say flip it, instead of letting someone else (mr. asperger) name your personality after them, why don't you try naming other peoples' personalities after you"

        "question": "Hi Bill! I was hoping you could maybe give me some tips on this. So, I play in a band with 2 guitarists (me being one of them). And for certain little sections in certain songs, I want to figure out a way to intertwine the rhythms of the 2 guitars in a way where it sounds like just 1 guitar, but with like a delay/echo type thing. Do you think if I play the same part the other guitarists plays, but slide the whole phrase forward like a 16th note (or maybe an 8th note?) that would kind of give it that delay/echo type sound? I don't have any recording equipment at home to experiment with.. but do you think this technique would work? Any tips or advice on how to make it sound extra crisp and natural?",
        "answer": "if you are talking about live playing, i don't think this is a reasonable strategy. it sounds more like a fun/impressive stunt that would require a lot of practice to do it right \"AMAZING, watch 2 guitar players emulate a delay pedal, just by playing at slightly different times!\" not worth it. a fun stunt maybe, but not a good strategy. if you're talking about recording it, sure you could shift one track a little later and make it a little quieter with a little more reverb, but it would still be much easier to use a delay effect. very easy to get access to one. perhaps even easier than getting access to recording equipment, which is also easy"

        "answer": "it is a derivative of Africa. it is authorized, and the songwriters of Africa are properly credited and paid. popular songs very often are either covers, samples, or derivatives of previous popular songs, and most of the time the original writers are credited and paid. one of the most famous examples is \"surfin USA\" by the beach boys, which has the entire same melody as \"sweet 16\" by chuck berry, who is credited and paid for \"surfin USA\" also. another famous example is Gansta's Paradise, which originally a Stevie Wonder song, who is credited and paid for Gangsta's Paradise as well. Another more recent example is Sam Smith's \"stay with me\" which was found to have nearly the same melody as \"won't back down\" by Tom Petty, and after an out-of-court settlement, tom petty is now credited and paid. there are hundreds more examples, and this has been common in popular music for many generations."

        "question": "How come when you have 4 eighth notes in a row, sometimes there all 4 grouped together and sometimes it's written as 2 groups of 2? Is there a difference?",
        "answer": "the rule i follow is, never beam more than 4 in a row, and don't beam across the 'imaginary barline' halfway through the bar. so if it's \"1 & 2 &\" beam all 4. if it's \"3 & 4 &\" beam all 4. if it's \"2 & 3 &\" beam it as 2 groups of 2 and leave the middle open. when it's the full bar, beam 2 groups of 4. for 16th notes you can apply similar rules except the 'imaginary bar line' would be between each beat, so again groups of 4 maximum, but don't beam anything across the imaginary barlines"

        "question": "When you were at the 8th annual shorty awards and that nico guy performed what was going through your head?",
        "answer": "well, here's the thing- they did their hit song \"am i wrong\" which i think is a wonderful song, and i've had a strong attachment to that song ever since i first heard it on the radio. but here's the problem (there's actually 2 problems) the first problem was their live performance had no live elements at all. it was the studio recording with the lead vocal muted. there was absolutely no live feel to it, and the studio vocals were a bit better, because it had better editing. so we were basically hearing the exact original recording, except with slightly worse vocals. the other problem was, unfortunately, the song did not go over well with the audience. they did their best to energize the crowd by shouting things like \"shorty awards\" and \"put your hands up\" etc etc, but it just wasn't working. again, i absolutely love the song and i love the recording, so this is not a complaint about the artist or the song, this is just my analysis of the situation"

        "question": "Sorry if I'm oversimplifying this (I know you do all types of content... scrambles, the question page, reality, jazz, improv, notebook, etc)... But it seems like you kind of \"made a name for yourself\" doing all the vines and short videos. Then you didn't want to get pigeon-holed as \"The Guy Who Makes Short Videos\" and when your fans came to expect more and more short videos, you put out HOJ and HOTEWIG. Then when everybody started demanding more and more history videos, you didn't want to get labeled as \"The Guy Who Makes History Videos\". Now, it seems like your focus is music videos for medium-length songs? My question is, what happens when everyone starts demanding more music videos and you become associated with this particular form of content? Will we see another big shift? Again, sorry if I'm oversimplifying your 'creative trajectory'. Like I said, I know you do all types of stuff. I'm a big fan of everything you put out, and you've been a huge inspirat ion to me as a musician myself, and as just a fellow person tryna be a person. Thank you for everything you do.",
        "answer": "i think you understand the general path very well. except, there are many elements of my past work that are unilaterally right for me, and i will continue to use. so it is not necessarily a game of always doing something completely new. it is mainly just about filling out the space of all the potential things that i think would be good for me. if you look at the discussions i was having a few years ago, there were several major 'houses' of types of content that needed to be explored, none of which had been fully explored at the time. so that's why shifts were necessary -- to make sure i explored everything that needed to be explored. medium-full length songs, with videos, is extremely important and has been important for a long time, and i've always written a huge surplus of them, so there is a lot of catching up to do. but still, free-videos (videos that are not exclusively based on 1 song) both fictional and non, is still a hugely vast area to explore, and having done such a huge amount of work on extremely short projects (due to the 4-vid-per-week schedule, and later due to the success of my vine channel) there is still a huge amount of exploring to do in the longer ranges"

        "answer": "when you say \"chords to a song\" that implies that you are gonna say them in the right order. unless you are trying to confuse someone. it's like \"words to a song\" means the words to the song, in the right order. you don't have to say 'word progression' or whatever. you can just say 'the words', and hopefully the person will say them in the right order unless they are some kinda maniac"

        "question": "i didn't mean that one hour long play script is one of the small steps. it's not a huge step for me but it definitely was a critical step that would help me take bigger steps forward. and i have no idea how i managed to do it either. after i took your advice i thought \"this is what i want to do, this is what i do best, what stops me? i can't take doing nothing anymore.\" and i started to note every little and crazy idea for anything, being reckless about if it's perfect for other people's standards. i travelled and wrote poems in those places. i tried to play guitar for the first time in years, it seems i need to dust off my old skills but ... i wrote lyrics, i guess? i had many, many, many fiction ideas for novels and i gained experience for non-fiction. and i did everything on a small scale. THEN i jumped in at the deep end by accepting a task, which is this play. in fact i was going to refuse but i had to accept, 'they' made m e. the m ain theme they gave to me was very common, but safe and i was given enough time to write. for like a week i didn't even start, i didn't think about it and then i remembered and i said \"okay, you know what, fuck this. they want me to do what everyone else does. i'll give them and the audience the theme they want, but i'll do it my way.\" and i started to write nonstop, contextualizing the subject in a way no one ever dared before. i didn't care, i was just writing and soon i realized it's finished in just eight hours. because of this success i was feeling confident, i sent them the script saying \"listen to me, i am your only chance to put this play on the stage in time, here is my script, i know it's crazy but i also know it's good, accept it or accept it, i won't be directing anything other than this.\" politely. and they LOVED it, i must admit that i was surprised. the play will be staged three months later (which is also a short time like eight hours for a play but i'll handle it) and i might do voice acting. i'm sure they will cut out the best scenes 'because it's not appropriate' but doesn't matter. the important thing is i have the original script i have written and one day i will be able to revive it the way i want. after the play is performed i'll continue with small but fast steps because i still don't feel ready to run, just like i said before it's just the beginning. so here comes the questi on, is m y situation somehow similar to how you started doing your contents? and what do you think about how my improvement is going? it's important for me to know, you were the only person i told my problems on writing and this drowning in infinity thing.",

        "question": "I have a lot of music written. Some of its fully recorded, some it's partially recorded, some it's just written out in paper. But, I have a good solid base of stuff to go off of. But right now, I'm stuck in a MAJOR rut. Like, what do I do with all this music? The logical thing I think would be pairing music with videos, graphics, or some kind of visual aspect. But the thing is, I've never really felt the \"calling\" of being a video-maker. It's not really something I'm passionate about at all, in the same way I am about making music... and if im not passionate about it, why even do it? Even if I do decide to at least try making videos, I have no experience in it and wouldn't even know where to begin... Also, I feel like just making videos for the sake of pairing something up with my music isn't a good strategy since it would just be like forcing 2 things together instead of creating something with sound and visuals together that go hand and hand as pa rt of a whole. I have some songs that I think can stand alone, like more traditional verse/chorus stuff with vocals... but most of my stuff is like weird little instrumental pieces, like 10 seconds to a minute in length, which I don't think would make much sense on their own (when I wrote them I had certain images in mind, like this song reminds me of a mad scientists tinkering with a bunch of test-tubes and bubbling chemicals, this song sounds like you just got \"game over\" in a video game, this song sounds like you just had an idea and a light bulb went off over your head, this song sounds like your taking a walk and then something crazy jumps out in front of you, this one sounds like you tried to do something epic but then failed in an anticlimactic way at the very end, etc)... sorry for this long rambling text. But I just feel like I've been standing in front of the same hurdle for a very long time and have no ideas how to jump over it and it's disheartening. If you have any advi ce for m e, I'd really appreciate it. Like should I just force myself to try to learn how to make videos, and hope that over time I learn to enjoy it, get better at it, and find my own voice/style? Or should I seek alternate routes (which routes, I don't know) that don't involve me making videos?",
        "answer": "well, if you really don't want to find any way to make videos but you feel like the material has to go with something visually (which i think is probably right) then you might consider finding someone else who wants to make the videos. or, another approach would be to find people that make videos and they are looking for music, and you could write music to their videos. neither of these options work for me because i am a control freak and i live under a rock. but because of that, i knew i had no choice but to learn how to make the videos myself. but if you don't want to do that you might try to explore some collaborative options"

I would like to use your question page as an opportunity to give a PSA to all those who read these questions. DO NOT MAKE JOKES ABOUT SOMEBODY'S NAME. THEY HAVE HEARD THE JOKE BEFORE COUNTLESS TIMES. YOU ARE NOT ORIGINAL, AND THEY DO NOT THINK IT IS FUNNY. If somebody's name is Jesse don't say \"Ha! Tha t's a gi rls name!\" If somebody's name is Duncan, don't call them \"Duncan Donuts\". If somebody's name is Richard, yes, they know that Dick is short for Richard and that dick can mean penis. If somebody's shares the same last name as a celebrity or a character from a tv show/movie/book, don't ask them if they are related to that person/character. If somebody's first and last name rhyme or if they have \"two first names\", you don't have to point that out for them. They know.",

If you have already submitted your music through one of their partners, I don't really know what else you can do other than wait it out.",

The chorus right before the bridge is cut short, so that entire chorus would be 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 5, 4, 3. The bridge is 6, 7, 6, 4, 7 (you could break this up in many different ways. also not totally sure about what the hang time is on the end of the bridge, i don't remember for sure) all these times are expressed in terms of quarter notes. so when i say \"5\" that means \"5/4\""

        "question": "others don't complete my work. i don't care whoever is it, i never would let someone do that, it's MINE. i just tell people what to do. but to stage something there are other people i have to work with, the people who made me write the script and who will probably cut some scenes out. it seems it's my only choice right now, to work with them or anyone else who is able to cut until i'm ready to take bigger and faster steps. i actually want to do it on my own, right now and i'm still trying to figure out how to do such a thing alone (and i'm open to any suggestion from you). i think writing anything is meant to be done alone and i do it that way because it's the best one but shooting a film or performing a play... i really have to work with a crew (and with some people outside the crew) unless we are talking about an online monologue video here. so yeah i'm not completely free at the moment but one day i will be, i have just begun. what i'm saying is, i don't rely on others to complete my work, it's more like i command them. you definitely should try this. even if 'they' are the people i told you about, i'm the one who is in the driver's seat and i wouldn't write the script if i wasn't. letting them cut stuff is compromising, because i know the script i've written is risky, and daring.",
        "answer": "right, i agree with all of this. and i do hope to do that stuff some day. the only thing is if you really want to tell a bunch of people what to do, you need to be at a reasonably high standing in society. meaning you need to be able to pay everyone adequately, at least if you want professional quality work. and if you can't afford to pay them, you have to always worry about whether they want to keep working with you, and you will be walking on eggshells, perhaps afraid to give the kind of serious direction you might want to give. Working completely alone is a different thing. it means you can't use actors, you can't have camera operators, .... you are limited to entirely different mediums, like animation, etc. and that is very hard work. like i said, it depends on your level of difficulty in working with others. if you really really can't do it (like i can't) then it might be worth it to re-imagine your entire career around things you can do yourself. at least until you have more resources. nowadays you can get further than ever working alone"

        "question": "hey Bill, i just read your update on the new project and how you are looking for faster ways to make videos. This is a very relevant issue for me as well, and i have some ideas that might be of use... i started out making everything in After Effects (i dont know what software you use but this should be relevant regardless) which is great and amazing but non efficient especially when you have a identity of textures and tones that is some kind of starting point and a through line through all your different projects but reusing previous stuff from other After Effects projects feels werid and is not ideal. i have recently been learning a coding language called Processing which i am using to create programs to execute visuals before i bring them into After Effects. For a a hopefully relevant example to you, i could make a program where i can type in text, have a rgb slider for base color of text, create duplicates of text on top of one another with differ ent colo rs and choose a display style like a repeating pattern of text or a silly wobble distortion or something. Then i can save the text as a picture or video and then do the polishing in After Effects. These little programs you can make for various reasons and reused without loosing freshness or constraints as you can easily add a few parameters to the code for every projects adding on to the base you have built up which you can execute and use immediately. The beginning of this process is the worst by far and takes time but it seems to me like the efficiency ratio is a constant upward line with no plateauing and from your knowledge of html from making this website, i think the starting momentum would not be too terribly slow. this might be helpful to you, thank you for changing the world all the time",

Later it can be good, but be bad right now,\" and you say, \" fine, whatever,\" and then you make music and it is always bad and then you are like, \"when will it get good,\" and then music is all like, \"it doesn't. It is always bad, and that's really good,\" and then you're like, \"that makes no fucking sense what are you talking about,\" and music says, \"well, I was just thinking that maybe I could, like, inspire you by saying that music is bad and you've been making bad music so I'm just trying to show that, like, if you make the music bad it is good or something,\" and then there's a long pause and then you're like, \"I'm gonna make good music now,\" and music says, \"fine whatever.\" Does that happen to you?",

        "question": "sometimes you don't have to pay people for them to make professional work. it depends on the person actually but there are other people out there who just want to express themselves by doing what they do best, i believe. if you can afford to pay them, they might keep working with you unwillingly for money and that's a problem. if you can't, authority and control will always be a problem and relationships will affect the work. yes, there are other people like us but what if we're not lucky enough to find anyone? i can't even find a fucking solution to these problems. i'm not talking about collab, i hope you understand, it's more about a crew. i'm not bad with people but i want the thing i make to be mine and i just can't follow orders. i need to be alone to be able to write anything, so poems, lyrics, stories and such are not a problem but scripts ... plays i have to direct and movies/shows i plan to make in the future feels like attaching rocks to my feet an d letting my originality sink because, you know, people. now if i don't like something i can just change it or get on the stage and perform myself but what will happen when things get more and more serious? i want to be free but there has to be a way to do it without being alone. i'm ok with being alone, i want to be, but this is never going to work for performing and shooting. since my primary goal was always writing, anything and everything, i'm used to be on my own but if i can't work this play and the crew thing out, i have to sacrifice the scripts and some of my dreams. i don't understand why this is happening. the first play took long and it consumed me but everything was good, i never thought i will do it again. i don't think it's about compromising, i was expecting that. i know i am the director and everything is under my control, just like i wanted. i really don't understand why.",
        "answer": "right, but their commitment will be dependent on delicate factors, such as how your personal relationship with them might be going sure, and they also 'unwillingly' need to eat to survive ah, too real i know what you mean you will have to work your way up. i am just barely even beginning to think about scratching the surface of various types of 'crew' solutions. but in my model, people need to be paid if you really want to expect them to do work and spend time, consistently, whether it's monday or friday most people would say yes. for me, weirdly, for reasons i have never understood, again and again the answer is unfortunately no. i have gotten used to this by now it's called earth and it's rough. you gotta bury things in the dirt and stomp on it until it makes food. and you gotta keep doing it. you may even have to hire animals if u can't do it fast enough. i don't know why we're here, it's pretty, but it's rough. it has actually gotten much much easier throughout the milleinia and centuries, but i'm telling you it's rough, and i think the name of this planet actually means 'challenge.' but it's important to remember that that's what you came here for, possibly because you were bored before, or maybe for a different reason, i'm not sure"

I know that I'll be working with other people for the rest of my life in my chosen career path, and I find it impossible to make friends (my only friend was someone I met on a film forum ten years ago) so essentially, how do I navigate this? I hate drawing negative attention to myself but I feel I do that by being so quiet whenever I'm at work, even though I usually have nothing to contribute. It's often presumed something's wrong with me because I remain silent, but I feel absolutely fine most of the time and I'll be polite/reply when spoken to. I only really connect with someone if they have the same level of social ineptitude or have the same very specific and intense interests as me. Please, help a gal out. Thanks.",

It goes A major with the root doubled in the G and high E strings, to Amaj7 to A7 to the chord i'm trying to find. Nothing about the chords are changing other than the descending chromatic scale on the high E string, so this next unknown chord would have F# in it. I'm thinking F#m add 11 omit 5 / A.",

I think you're just being defeatist to rule out all collaboration when you have demonstrated on some level that it is within your grasp. if anyone can come up with a game plan and a system of ensuring the collaboration is designed in such a way that it results in Desired User Experience, then it's you, and i'm saying that because you figured out the much harder puzzle of becoming unconfused about how to make anything at all. you lament the slowness of your production but rule out th e most p otent soltion instead of making it work for you, with cleverness and ingenuity. manhours are what you need to get the workrate you crave, and, right now, there are more untapped manhours at your disposal out there in the world than you have left in your entire life. ruling out the option of collaboration strikes me as so unlike your philosophy of there being so many shades of gray in every issue and challenge. i genuinely believe you can do anything you set your mind to. love, a fan for life",

I've had asthma since I was a kid, and other recurring respiratory issues.. so sometimes it's tough to hold out a note for a long time, or to sing a full phrase without having to stop to take a breath, I think it might limit my vocal range too. When I do try and sing, I sound like if Donald Fagen smoked way too many cigarettes and put a clothespin on his nose. I love music, and I like to think that I am pretty decent on the instruments I play, but so many songs are driven by the vocal parts. Like, I think really the function of instruments in a song is to compliment/accompany the vocals (which should usually be front and center)... Not really singing makes it tough for me to actually come up with vocal parts, so I try to over-compensate with the instruments when I write. But when I do play with a singer, usually there's too much going on with the in strument al arrangements and it sounds too jumbled/cluttered. Any advice for me?",

        "question": "Hi. So the earth completes 1 rotation in 24 hours. That's 1/86400 seconds which is about 0.00001157407 Hz. Move that up a few octaves (22) and you pretty much got a G note. Using the same math... I found that Mercury and Venus are both closest to A. Earth and Mars are closest to G. Jupiter is closest to Bb. Saturn is closest to A. Uranus is closest to C#. Neptune is closest to D. So our solar system is playing, like a Gm9#11 chord? Why such a sad, weird, dissonant chord do you think? Why does our solar system feel like that? Pluto would be closest to B... which would make the chord even weirder.... I don't even know what you'd name that chord. Maybe this is why scientists don't want to make pluto a planet???",
        "answer": "it's important to remember that those frequencies are not close enough in tune to warrant calling it the chord you called it. some of them are really like half way in between notes. i think if you are interested in what it sounds like, you will need to try putting all those frequencies together (multiplied up several octaves of course) and hear what it sounds like"

There are slow parts and fast parts. So if the fast part is going faster than the slow part, then why isn't there a gap in between the fast and slow parts where there isn't any water?\" and I knew how rivers worked so I told him \"the size of the river changes\" and he was like \"yes! That's how good time works! it can speed up or slow down, but there is always the same amount of 'water', and when people aren't very good at keeping time, there are these wedges in the river where there is empty space.\" I love this analogy but I still don't fully understand the \"water\" part in terms of music.

        "question": "You know that feeling when you hear a little phrase in a song that gives you goosebumps? I've always wanted to write/play something so good that i give myself the chills, and i have never been able to do it. Sometimes when playing with a band it's happened to me, like when everything just clicks and everyone in the group is really reading each other and you can feel that connection (like sometimes when improvising or 'jamming' i get that feeling like i know exactly what my bassist and drummer are about to do, and they know exactly what i'm about to do, and it's magical)... but i think that's more about that feeling of unity, than the sound itself. Like if somebody were recording it and played it back, i don't know if i'd still get goosebumps. But never when i'm just playing by myself, or working on a recording, have i been able to give myself chills, and i've always kind of viewed that as a 'litmus test' of my songwriting/playi ng abili ty. So far, it's a test i've failed. But i don't know if that's because it's impossible to do to yourself.... Have you ever given yourself goosebumps with your own playing/writing in any of your songs? Is it even possible to give yourself the chills? I'm happy with the songs i've written, but i feel like i'm still searching for that elusive little phrase.",
        "answer": "oh hell yeah yes i know exactly what you mean you can hear it too i think you do i think you're exactly right it's possible yes yes just keep writing a lot, and experimenting, and remember that there's no limits to what you can put in the song"

        "question": "Am I a part of the universe? Sometimes I feel as if I am but a trespasser. One who observes and tries to watch and understand, but does not contribute. The universe placates me into complacency and boredom through shallow joys and entertainments. My friends placate each other to avoid negative emotions. Best to do nothing at all than to risk doing something bad. But a deep part of my soul stirs itself and yearns for more. I'm thinking of running away from this toxic environment and learning to play an instrument or some sort of art or something-anything- to contribute to the beauty around me. But I'm scared to take the first step. Beaten into being afraid of making even the smallest misstep. Afraid of the unknown. I want to dive into the universe rather than stay as a passive observer, but I still don't understand it well enough to find a path on my own. And I don't want to follow the footsteps of another, or I will be constantly comparing myself to them and replacing my old rules and rigidity with a new set. How do I be myself or know what I like if I have no idea what either of those things mean? How to test if something is me, or if something is what I like? My whole world is soulless and unresponsive, how do I pick up a personality without just copying others?",
        "answer": "yes you'll just have to guess see if you can do it, comfortably copy multiple different people, and merge the personalities. or you could try something totally new, but that's optional, as you have surely noticed"

        "answer": "every song is different. in many cases the drums have the least to worry about because they don't have to really learn the chord changes. however, there are many songs where drummer crucially needs advanced knowledge of the road map, breaks, hits, kicks, etc. although this is reasonably easy to memorize by counting. chord changes can be very easy to memorize if you have a large familiarity with common music, and the song is relatively normal. the vocals would usually be by far the hardest to immediately get, due to lyrics"

        "question": "When I write down music, I always get confused about sharps, flats and natural symbols. Like if you have a note outside of the key signature and you put a flat,sharp or natural symbol on it, by the next measure are you supposed to assume that if that same note has no symbol then it's back to normal? Or if the note is altered in one clef, but not the other, do I put a sharp/flat/natural symbol on just the one clef and leave the other one unaltered? What if there's a modulation, do I put the new key signature in the middle of the score, or do I just adjust the sharps and flats accordingly? My strategy is just to write everything as if it's in the key of C. Notes that are sharp I write the sharp symbol, notes that are flat I write the flat sumbol. I never write the natural symbol, and if a note is played with a sharp or flat multiple times in the same bar, I write the symbol each time (instead of just once). This works fine for me, because usually the only per son who reads my sheet music is me. And this system makes sense to me.... but is this a bad strategy if I were to share my music with other people?Like if I were to write something out for some horn players or a piano player or whatever, would this system throw them off do you think?",
        "answer": "in situations like that i think courtesy accidentals are very important if it stays there for a significant amount of time, then put a new key signature that is sometimes called an 'open key' and it is mainly used when it's just so all over the place it's not worth putting a key signature. i used an open key for a video where i transcribed and harmonized spoken language, as music. no sense putting a key because it was all over the place. but most 'reasonable' music should have a key signature yes. accidentals last at least until the end of the bar. i always thought there was disagreement about whether or not they last until the end of the line. but they definitely last at least until the end of the bar, and you should not be repeating the symbol if the note stays that way within the same bar, and therefore you need a natural to specify if it changes back. and if it changes back right at the beginning of the next bar, probably use a courtesy natural just in case. if it's in different octaves i think the rules become a little more ambiguous and courtesies are good, i'm not sure of the exact rules when it's different octaves"

        "question": "Hi I just asked the question about sharps, flats and naturals. I guess the altered note in one clef but not the other would never really come up because you'd just change the scale degree.. like if you had a C7#9 or whatever you'd never write the #9 note as Eb, you'd write it as D# so that way you don't have an E and Eb)... but I'm not really asking you about the sharp/flat rules.. I'm more just curious about my system.",
        "answer": "that's true but there are some situations when it gets really dense when you might need F and F# at the same time. let's say if you are scoring a horror movie or something you might even need them in the same octave because you have F, F#, G all mashed together. i honestly have no idea how you would notate that. it is rare and only in extremely dissonant 'horror' type situations"

        "question": "What do you mean by \"hymnifying the second half\" or \"fractal-like duck form\"?",
        "answer": "'hymnifying the second half' is what i sometimes call the thing in a traditional song form where the 4th 8th is the 5 chord, and the 8th 8th is the 1 chord, and the 7th 8th usually contains 1 over 5 and 5. you've heard it thousands of times. she'll be coming around the mountain, etc. Fractal like duck form is a phenomenon that occurs where the landing point of the first half is in the same relative time position as the landing point of the whole thing, relative to the whole thing. so for example, over the course of a 4 bar phrase of lyrics, let's say your first line lands halfway through the second bar, that's squarely on the 4th quarter of the first half. then your next line should have its landing point at the top of the 4th bar, which is the halfway point of the second half, and hence the start of the 4th quarter of the whole thing. so your landing point of the entire thing is in the same position relative to the whole as the landing poing of the first half was to the first half. this creates a fractal-like self-similarity that the mind responds very well to, and is present in many many lyrics/songs and rhythmic poems. here is a simple example from lil wayne, over the course of 2 bars, where the landing point of the first half is on the 4th quarter of the first half, and then the landing point of the second half is halfway thru the second half, making it on the 4th quarter of the entire thing."

        "question": "I know this is probably a tough question, but do you have any tips on writing melodies? If you give me a melody, I can arrange it (figure out harmonies, bass line, drum beats etc)... but I always hear people say that melodies just 'come to them', like they just appear out of nowhere in their heads like magic... but this has never been the case for me. I usually write a chord pattern that I think sounds interesting, then I try to build a melody from the notes in the chords. Sometimes I can do it, sometimes I can't. But I know I'm doing it backwards. Melody should come first. Melody is the most important part of a song.",

        "question": "Hi Bill! Sorry if you're tired of getting hotewig questions.. but I'd like to know more about your thought process/goals for writing the intro part. After the big bang, there's pretty much a straightforward story line for you to follow (if you can call the history of the world straightforward)... but everything from \"hi, you're on a rock...\" up until \"i think there's a universe now\" must've been really tricky to write. The origin of the universe (and history of the universe) seems like a real tough story to set the scene for. Did you find it hard to come up with a good intro for the video? (Btw I think you nailed it).",
        "answer": "that was probably the most fun part. explaining the motivations for a universe happening, from the perspective of there not being a universe. and it's really common sense, i think, if you look at it from the right perspective, but the problem is you are not allowed to properly use time or space in the description because those things only exist if there is a universe. and most language as we know it is based on time and space. so it makes for some thrilling turns of phrase"

I imagine it's very hard to make the visual rhythm of the images FEEL in lockstep with the musical rhythm. I wonder how much the visual rhythm informs our experience of the audio rhythm?",
        "answer": "that part is actually very easy for me. timing has been my strong point since a very young age. and i find it is a very powerful tool and makes the sound come alive when the video moves to match it"

I agree with you that it is much harder do appeal do people if you have no lyrics, but still..",
        "answer": "yes no, trust me, i am Hard-Wired as an instrumental musician. in my childhood i listened to only instrumental music, and didn't know how to really deal with anything else. the first many years of my musical development were vastly instrumental only. mostly artists who's music was marketed as instrumental music, in its own right. but there is an elephant in the room, which everyone always thinks about, which is \"why do those instrumental artists never seem to be as successful as non-instrumental artists, even though *we* (musicians) 'know' they're 'better' \" etc etc sad face. i just didn't feel like going along with such a sad conclusion so i was driven to understand, so i erased everything i knew and started listening to pop radio all day. anyway, that's beside the point, what i'm trying to say is, over time it became crystal clear that instrumental music operates in the back part of your brain, but the labels, the handles, the latches, the characters, the *cognition* as the scientists would call it, happens in the 'front' part of your brain. i guess it's called the frontal lobe, or the neo-cortex, or whatever .. (not a brain expert really) but it's kind of like where you file things. it's what you name things. even if the *feelings* and the deep stuff are all happening on a much deeper level, you will always have them 'filed' or 'named' in a particular way. and each person may file things differently. but that's what i realized about instrumental music. vastly powerful, usually doing most of the real heavy lifting in terms of actually making the over-all product feel good, does all work in terms of pulling the heartstrings, BUT the frontal 'handles' (characters, words, names, titles, etc etc, the frontal stuff) will always seem to get the credit. that's just the way it works. and the same is true for my childhood listening to instrumental music -- for example, let's say an album of instrumental music is sold under a particular musician's name, and they play a certain instrument (let's say it's piano). that's the 'frontal' content, the label / title etc... in other words, when you listen to it, you are 'cognizant' of the fact that you are listening to a piano player's music. you are aware that that is what's happening. so if that reality is something you are comfortable with, then you will be comfortable listening to that music. where-as, take for example, a movie, with scenes in it about troubles in a relationship due to long distance separation, etc etc etc, but it happens to be underscored by piano. you are still listening to instrumental piano music, but you whole idea of what's happening will be different. you will probably think of it as 'i'm watching this scene in a movie about these characters etc this is what's going on\" rather than \"i'm listening to piano music\" ... now not everyone necessarily files things the same way, because for example someone interested in film scoring could easily be listening to it and hearing the underscoring, and that's likely a main reason they would be watching the movie, to specifically enjoy the underscoring. but even so, that reality is still different from listening to a piano player's album, because the film-scoring person is not just listening to the score, but they are listening to it from a film-scorers perspective. when we are studying and learning things, that often determines the angle we focus on. another example, let's say it comes from a video game. the music will have all it's power but it will be connected with the game, and the game will again act as the 'handle' or 'filing system' that sort of 'delivers' the music to the listener, and in turn the music is richly juicing up the contents of the game, to feel so much more meaning, and again usually the 'handles' (the content of the game) will get all the credit. unless, again, it is a music student or a musician listening, in which case That would be their 'handle.' so even when instrumental music seems to be purely insrumental with nothing else, there is always some context in which the listener heard it. for example, let's say you are walking down the street and all of a sudden you randomly hear instrumental music coming out of a fire-hydrant. well guess what, that's not just detached music, that's music you heard coming out of that fire hydrant, and when you tell the story you will always remember that music as the music that was coming out of that fire hydrant. so in that sense the only way to actually have completely unfiled unassociated instrumental music is if you were hearing the music and you literally don't know where it's coming from and you also don't know where you are, and also don't remember the circumstances that led to you not knowing where you are. so basically my point is that yes truly and surely instrumental music has all the powers. but it is made of liquid and you really can't drink any of it unless you have a cup"

        "question": "Hi Bill. So I'm thinking about looking for work as a piano teacher, just to make some extra $$$. I've never really put much thought into how I'd teach music, starting from square one, to a beginner. What do you think would be a really good thing to do for a first lesson for someone who has never played before? I don't mean to sound conceited or anything like that, but I started playing so young that I really don't remember first learning. Other people in my family play, so I was probably just banging on the piano as a baby. By the time I first started taking lessons as a kid, I already had a very basic 'feel' for the piano (like I was able to pick out really simple melodies by ear, knew some chords, and was able to play extra simple stuff with both hands at the same time). What do you think would be a good first step for someone starting from nothing? Do you remember first learning to play piano?",
        "answer": "discovering (on their own) the intense joy and power that comes from pressing the notes, and hearing how the sounds compare to each other me neither me too me too you and i are biased, because we learned completely on our own from an extremely young age. unfortunately, 90% of your students will be nothing like this. i think you are gonna hate teaching and i think you are gonna cancel all your lessons after the second week. that's just my best guess at what is going to happen here i have very faint memories of things like playing all the Cs really quickly up and down the keyboard, and i have very vague memories of understanding the C+E harmony, and its sister harmony, D+F. but i must have been only about 3 years old then and i don't remember ever not knowing those things"

        "answer": "yeah i know it's pretty bad that's true too well i'm not necessarily alone by choice. i've probably talked about this before, but that's an ongoing question. throughout school i was always very aware that i wanted so badly to be 'included' and have a great group of friends and have lots of fun, but that consistently never became a reality, year after year, for reasons i could never figure out. but there was another thing happening too, which was that i sort of had an infinite world of musical and artistic vision going on, which no one else seemed to relate to. it seems there were infinite things i wanted to figure out and create. and i was always extremely disappointed that no one seemed capable or willing to go on this journey with me. and i think every time i tried to fit in, the reality is that i probably couldn't hide the fact that i was bored with everyone. i was trying not to be, because i wanted so bad to fit in and have friends, but i think in most cases people thought that it was ME who was not interested in THEM. anyway, this pattern continued on and on, through school and beyond. and i continued to develop my skills and ideas fiercely and passionately, sort of regretting being alone but making the most of it, and also clinging on to various threads of social contact .... until one day in a particularly bad season socially (like really there was no one to hang out with), i hit a turning point and realized that i've always known i could and should accomplish something really really serious with my life, and i should probably just accept the fact that i'm going to do this alone. and that's when i really really got serious and professional about it, and keeping journals, and really just working toward it even more seriously than before. that was years ago, and since then i have really no longer had that 'panicked' feeling of being alone -- i accepted it as part of the picture, and never looked back. and i've gotten an insane amount of work done and launched my career. and it's been so many years now that i am totally comfortable and used to the alone-ness, but occasionally maybe a couple times a year it just gets really really annoying"

        "question": "Hi Bill. I don't really understand what you mean when you say things like \"i sort of had an infinite world of musical and artistic vision going on, which no one else seemed to relate to. it seems there were infinite things i wanted to figure out and create. and i was always extremely disappointed that no one seemed capable or willing to go on this journey with me\"... Maybe that was the case when you were younger, or maybe even with people you've met or talked to face to face... But, you have so many huge fans (like millions of people probably) of the stuff you make, and judging by this question page, so many artists/musicians/writers who view you as a major influence and inspiration (myself included). So, I am confused why you think that people don't relate to what you're doing, or that people wouldn't love to go on your journey with you.",
        "answer": "keep in mind, when i was in 3rd grade, most people didn't know what i was capable of, or what i would be capable of in the future. and even when the product finally comes out (which is like decades of hard work later), sure they may enjoy the product, but that has no bearing on whether they relate to the lifestyle it takes to create it. now it's a whole different story, because now there are a lot of people that want to collaborate with me for publicity"

The whole \"collab\" thing has become very fake, like 2 people pretending to be friends, who really don't know each other at all, doing a video together only because their managers or promoters or whoever arranged it for them. Then they'll beat the dead horse of doing some kind of 'challenge vid' or some other over-done concept just for the sake of advertising eachother's channels to the other person's fan base... I'm not saying I think you should feel pressured or obligated to collaborate with other people or anything like that, but maybe it's kind of an over-generalizatio n to say that other people are only interested in working with you for publicity's sake?

There's a lot of heavy, deeply personal stuff that comes out in my lyrics and my drawings that I have never expressed or shared with the people I know. And if any of them see it, it would be dropping a huge bombshell on them, changing their perceptions of me. I'm not really afraid of people not liking it, moreso just people thinking 'what the fuck, man'... I have no problems sharing the stuff I make with complete strangers.. but the thought of having friends or family see it is just downright terrifying for me (nobody even knows that I draw or write lyrics/sing... I only share instrumental stuff with friends)... Can you relate? Did you ever ha ve any worries or concerns about this type of thing?",

(Maybe it's used in reference to melody/rhythm too, but I usually hear it in reference to harmony). I know you say that the 'best' chord is the one that best supports the melody, but any melody can be harmonized in like a billion different ways, each giving its own unique character to the melody. When you're writing a song do you consciously think about dissonance & consonance or tension & release? For me, I kind of base it off the lyrics and/or how the melody makes me feel. Do you think the whole tension/release thing is more just like a metaphor to describe the function of harmony in a song? Or is it like a tool, or a lense you can look through when writing?",
        "answer": "i think those terms are possibly too nebulous be anywhere near as helpful as listening to the actual sound of the harmonies you are using, or considering using i listen to the way the music sounds if you are looking for something that you couldn't already hear from listening the music, i don't think you're going to find it the only lense i look through is the way the music sounds, including all the words and their sounds and the way the whole thing sounds together with the music. there might be other lenses but i don't use them"

        "question": "Question for Bill Wurtz on 10.1.17 4:23 pm : \"define random.\" Bill says chosen without reason blah blah preferably by computer to eliminate accidental reasoning I feel the particular response to be inadequate due to some research \"One thing that traditional computer systems aren't good at is coin flipping,\" says Steve Ward, Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. \"They're deterministic, which means that if you ask the same question you'll get the same answer every time. In fact, such machines are specifically and carefully programmed to eliminate randomness in results. They do this by following rules and relying on algorithms when they compute.\" You can program a machine to generate what can be called \"random\" numbers, but the machine is always at the mercy of its programming. \"On a completely det erminist ic machine you can't generate anything you could really call a random sequence of numbers,\" says Ward, \"because the machine is following the same algorithm to generate them. Typically, that means it starts with a common 'seed' number and then follows a pattern.\" The results may be sufficiently complex to make the pattern difficult to identify, but because it is ruled by a carefully defined and consistently repeated algorithm, the numbers it produces are not truly random. \"They are what we call 'pseudo-random' numbers,\" Ward says. - MIT School of Engineering How do you feel about this? Will you stay with your stance of preferring computers to eliminate accidental reasoning or have you been influenced to believe that the machine can never trump human creativity",
        "answer": "if you just take a number value associated with the current time, on a very small scale, and convert it to mod7 for example, (if you are looking for a number from 1 to 7) you will easily get random choices that no human user could ever manipulate. but furthermore, there are even some more advanced techniques happening on random.org which enables it to easily give me random sequences of numbers which are more than good enough for anything i could possibly need random numbers for"

        "question": "10.16.17 12:57 pm I think you said that you mostly use a voice memo thing for getting ideas down when they come to you... do you usually just sing the main melody? Are you able to come up with chords/harmony in your head, and if so, how would you record that? What about drum parts/bass line?",
        "answer": "melody, lyric, then just explain anything else that seems important or not obvious. chords for a melody are often obvious. like when you draw a duck's head, it's pretty much assumed that you're gonna have a duck's body there too. another important thing is to count it off, because a melody sung out of thin air can be ambiguous about where the top of the bar is. so i might count off, might orient the key in case it's not clear, might clarify what the chords are if necessary, and for the groove i might quickly sing something or might compare it to another song's groove, for reference. if i have a keyboard available i might play/sing a quick demo. i often over explain, especially in terms of count-off, because new ideas can disappear easily and you might not know how the time is oriented so i try to be as clear as possible"

        "answer": "that's totally fine, (and you probably don't even need the A note) as long as there is an A note in the bass register. that is going to determine whether your chord sounds like a type of C chord or an A chord. the bass player has this power over every chord, deciding whether each chord sounds like a major chord or its relative minor. so be nice to your bass player and if possible never allow your music to be played through built-in smartphone or tablet speakers"

        "question": "I feel like I'm stuck on a plateau in terms of creativity/skill and don't know how to keep climbing up. I know the solution is not think about how 'good' my stuff is and just to keep writing, which I am doing.. but I'm getting frustrated and having a hard time being satisfied with the stuff I make. When I was first learning I could write something super simple using just open chords or something, and I'd fall in love with it. Be so proud of it and show off my new song to all my friends.. The funny thing is I like a lot of those first songs I wrote just as much, if not more, than the stuff I'm doing now. And I think a lot of it has to do with the mindset I had then. I remember first learning how to play a C7 chord and thinking 'Oh man, this is so cool!!' Have you ever felt like you reached the top of a plateau? How did you turn your plateau back into a mountain?",
        "answer": "no i think you are up against a simple nostalgia problem. nostalgia gets us again and again, and it goes in waves. soon you will realize that anything you've ever done is no more 'special' than any new thing you can now do. and the things you did then were once things you had never done, where perhaps back then you were emotionally attached to some other previous thing. you will eventually get out of this by just putting on your hustling cap and doing whatever you can, do many many many things, just jump in and start going crazy. the bad news is you will probably have nostalgic feelings later for this, looking back. and then you just repeat the cycle"

        "question": "So my parents aren't musicians but my mom tells me she used to obsessively play classical music a bunch while she was pregnant with me. I didn't touch a keyboard until I was 6 or 7. Anyway, now I'm 20 and I've been doing music stuff for like 10+ years with few lessons(or direction) but I know middle \"C\" indefinitely. And because I know \"C\" i can figure out every other note too(maybe I'm not explaining this right) my point is i can figure out any notes to a thing as long as I think from \"C\" first. I explained this to my teacher and he was like \"that's perfect pitch\" but I always thought perfect pitch was effortless. Honestly it doesn't matter much to me cuz I got to where I was thinking I'm relative pitch so even if I don't have perfect pitch It's not like it's impossible to be good with relative. I was just wondering I you ever heard of this kind of thing. Take care. -bro-bro",
        "answer": "right. you have a very effective and wily workaround, which i have as well right. to be a musician, relative pitch is 100% required. perfect pitch (otherwise known as \"absolute pitch\") really doesn't have anything to do with music and is not required at all to be a good musician, and is really not even a reliable indicator of good musicianship but here's the ironic thing: there are many many people who frolic all over the place telling people they have perfect pitch, but whenever you test them, they're not even close. my point is, if you have the skill that you have (springboarding off a strong memory of C) then not only can you get the job done, but you can probably do it better than most people who actually claim to have it. so i say you might as well just say you have it. to increase your strength, familiarize yourself with where a low C is in your vocal register, (you can usually hum it quietly, should be a casual and easy note for a male, if you are a male) and just practice trying to find that note while other songs are playing. also familiarize yourself with the key of every song you've ever heard, and always learn what key songs are in. this will help you even more. perfect pitch (absolute pitch), or the sneaky workaround you have, is not at all required to be a wonderful and great musician, BUT it will provide you with an extra edge in professional situations"

And for me, it's a tool that I don't really use a lot anymore. It was helpful when I was transcribing lots of stuff, but people with good relative pitch can do it at essentially the same speed. The same goes for anything else someone with perfect pitch can do. In my opinion and in my experience, people who brag about perfect pitch are really insecure. Anyway Bill, my question is: Do you like making longer and stronger videos, or do you want to go back to making vine-sized videos? I know you've talked about how they're not really feasible on youtube because of the algorithm. Please use capital letters.",
        "answer": "right, that's why i prefer to call it 'absolute pitch' right, and to my surprise, they mostly don't even really have it i had already made more than enough 5-10 second videos BEFORE my vine channel took off. and then i had to make a million more. so i definitely need to focus on lengths of at least 45 seconds or more that's not true, i have never talked about that, i am not concerned with the algorithm, i don't know the algorithm, and it has never been a restriction for me i do"

        "answer": "well, computer programs actually sometimes do call it 24th notes, just because it's consistent, mathematically. But, ... in writing it is usually called some type of triplet or sextuplet. in your situation, i would prefer to call it \"16th note triplets\" for clarity's sake, although i'm sure people would just say 'sextuplets' and assume you know what they mean. i prefer to write it as a group of 6 notes, double beam, except only a single beam between the 3rd and 4th notes. so 2 groups of 3 16th notes, connected in the middle by a single beam. you can put the triplet arc (and number 3) over each group of 3. or if you want i guess you could put one arc over the whole thing and put 6. that works too, i guess. i hope that answers your question"

        "question": "So is your last note written in 2016 and you are updating the notebook page with previously written notes?",
        "answer": "well, it really depends what counts. which has been an ongoing blurred line for quite some time. particularly after i started writing for twitter regularly in 2014. nowadays each update for \"new\" content to the notebook page actually consists of mostly combing through all my tweets and picking out which ones seem to be more central to me, and weeding out the ones that seem to just be composed to fill space on twitter. then uploading them and tracking down the dates, preferably when it was written, not when it was tweeted (there is often a several day difference.) and ALSO a new notes update entails going through my files and finding other things that i have written which might work well exclusively for the notes page. but there are less and less of those, over time, because while i used to use text as both an outlet for journaling and creativity, nowadays my primary outlet for journaling is audio recordings, and my primary outlet for creativity is audio/visual content. so what's happening is, in terms of newly written content for the notebook page, the vast majority of it will be things that have already been released on twitter. so in other words, when i do the next big \"new\" notebook update, it's going to be 95% tweets that you would have already seen if you follow my twitter page. and if you follow my twitter page you will see a new tweet every day. in addition i am constantly filling in more and more content from the past (much longer stuff, not tweets). people constantly ask my \"why i don't use the notebook page anymore\" but i continue to use it for the same purpose i have always used it, and furthermore if you want to see the new content, it's on twitter, every day. i hope that makes sense"

        "question": "i am so lonely that i type out inane things to a man i have never met and most probably never will in the hopes that he will type something in return, causing me to feel heard and validated, even if the question was something like 'do horse butts have hopes and dreams', and when this man does not pick my message out of hundreds it feels like a personal failure and i imagine him looking at what i sent and wrinkling his nose and going 'eugh' and scrolling on past and that image hurts like hell and causes me to feel way more proud than i should when i am answered because that supposedly means i wrote something brilliant enough to deserve an answer but really it was just something that he could think of a response to, and i imagine him answering that question but still wrinkling his nose at it because of how dumb it is, but reading his answers to people who expect him to be annoyed by certain questions/etc. and the rest of his answers in general seem to show tha t that image isn't accurate but i still fear that my questions are bad, but keeping this in mind calms me enough to send in stupid shit anyway because it's fun and it's nice to share fun even if you can't know for sure if the other person likes it, because the alternative would be to hold onto every thought, light and heavy like helium balloons and stones tied to strings, forever without anyone getting to know your way of fun or perhaps helping you to carry the heavy stuff. anyway this is a cordial invitation to my underwater tea party, b.y.o.a.t. (bring your own air tank), located in the sea of okhotsk at coordinates 52.996011, 147.384337. check the box that indicates whether or not you consent to hug and be hugged warmly and egregiously by other consenting guests [ ] yes please [ ] no thank you, not really much of a hugger",

        "question": "Any tips on what I should look for in getting a vocal mic (like one I can plug into my computer to record singing, not for live performance). I know you don't want to advertise a specific brand or model or anything.. but are there like, I don't know, particular features or something like I should look for? Or are they all the same and it's just the more expensive ones sound better? I really have no experience or knowledge about recording singing, so I'm not sure what to look for or where to start.",
        "answer": "if you want to know my strategy, it is: use whatever you already have. if you literally don't have anything that is in any way capable of recording your voice (and i think you do, but in case you live in the desert or something) then use the one that is absolutely easiest for you to obtain. don't do a damn thing better until you are used to the way it sounds and know what you can do with it. if you 'don't know where to start' then it's not time for you to give a damn about which mic you use. it's time to give a damn about whether someone can understand the words you are saying. 120 years ago they made records out of wax, and they had a damn good time doing it"

Like, try to detach yourself from the recording for a minute and just listen to it as if it's not a song you've written, but something that you're hearing for the 1st time on the radio or something like that? Just to kind of clear your thoughts or get a fresh view? Sometimes I run into this problem when recording that after meticulously doing take after take after take to get everything just right, the passion for the song starts to dwindle from that initial spark of the idea. Not that I don't love the process of fleshing out the ideas, but after working on it for a while I guess it's maybe natural that you'd start to get sick of it (like how you say that you haven't actually watched hoj or hotewig after posting them)?",

        "question": "8.20.16 8:22 am Hey i was looking through the random questions and saw this one. Is it true that the songwriters usually make more money than the singer of the tune does? I think it happens a lot that songwriters and the session musicians aren't really credited on the albums. This isn't new either. You look at like old motown records or something and all you see is the name of the singer. When I find an instrumental part I really like, it's always a chore to figure out who was actually playing on that album. Although I guess nowadays, pop artists don't really make most of their money through album sales and stuff like that anymore.",
        "answer": "i'm actually not sure, i do things in a unique way where i get to do everything myself and no one bothers me. this is made possible by a recent invention called the internet, which more and more people are using nowadays, in new and innovative ways, and it is continuing to shift the boundaries of the system(s) which were previously in place"

Like narrating the steve video or something while the band plays the score behind you live? That would be really unique.

Does harmonizing a melody in thirds mean you play notes that are a 3rd above the melody part, or play notes where the original melody would be a third above what you're playing.. like if the melody note is C in the key of C, you'd play an A below the C or you play an E above the C? I know either way could work and sound good in different situations, but I guess I don't really understand the terminology.",
        "answer": "it could be either one it would usually be either E or actually G. maybe A, depending on the context to harmonize a melody in 3rds, in reality you will probably be using a mix of major and minor 3rds, with occasional 4ths. but the only way to know for sure what you want is to listen"

        "question": "the night before last i had a dream that my cats were being mysteriously cloned and i couldn't tell my original cats from the clones and it was stressing me out because i didn't know which ones were the ones i knew and loved. they didn't all look exactly the same, it was like how identical twins look mostly the same but have some differences (and identical twins basically are clones, they're two split from one). one of them was much easier to tell each different one apart because she has a particular pattern but the other one is just solid black floof and it was impossible to tell those ones apart. but even with the patterned one i couldn't find the one that could actually be her because none of them had the correct misshapen white star on her back, and i keep comparing all the different cats with all the different incorrect white patches, and i sort of decided one had to be her and sent the rest off, one to my grandfather next door, but as i did th at i beg an to have second thoughts and realized the one i sent to my grandfather was most likely her and i ask my brother if he could see about getting her back from him but he tells me that he didn't want to deal with having a cat so he went and got it euthanized the same fucking day. and then i kicked myself for not just checking which cats had an rfid chip and now my fucking cat is fucking dead, and then i feel guilty about all the other cats because it's not like they don't matter because they weren't any less real but i could only deal with the two who had known me and all those other ones didn't give a shit about me because they didn't know me. they were pretty much feral. and i kept trying to keep them all from hurting themselves in the house like a tiny albino floofy one getting stuck in a small water glass and having to pull it out before it drowned, and when i would they would just walk off without any acknowledgement and they didn't come close to warming up to me in any w ay. and then i thought about if one of the clones had gotten euthanized instead. would i have even Cared? if i had found my cat one of the other cats would have been deprived of its newfound life, and by her being sent to my grandfather rather than the clone that otherwise would have been, they were granted the opportunity to live and do their own kitty thing. but it still hurt. it felt like i'd failed her, because i had. but i would have failed the other cat that would have taken her place. i didn't have a dream last night because i didn't sleep last night. not because of all this but because my sleep schedule is #craycray and instead of sleeping at night i look at your website. just thought i would share because i have no one else to share it with and it was bothering me but i didn't want to forget about it. i figured writing it out would help me remember it better and i've got the questions page pulled up so why the hell not",

        "question": "Every time I try to actively write music, I get hung up on the fact that there is really a limited number of ways to write a song. I'm a jazz guitarist and I know my chords super well. Every key, every extension, every inversion (thats physically possible to play). I try to rhythmically spruce up my progressions, but I really feel that the core of harmony (tonic, dominant, and predominant functional chords) is limiting. I, iii, and vi share two notes, ii and IV share two notes, and V and vii are basically interchangable. I got into modal interchange when I started to feel bored with diatonic progressions. At this point, I feel like I've emptied my bag of tricks. This is basically the ultimate struggle of composition. People have been trying to answer this question for hundreds of years. How do you combat the limitations of writing music? In other words, how do you push out so much material and still hold a constant level of creativity wit h what y ou write?",

Why do you hate the Mapahajit? They don't even exist",

        "question": "Why do you think 'pop hate' is such a common thing? Specifically with music too, there doesn't seem to be nearly as much hate directed towards 'popular' movies or books or art, etc. I always hear/read those 'music was so much better back in the day' things too, when a lot of those bands that people loved from 'back in the day' were pop bands (i.e. the beatles). Sorry, long rambling question.. but I don't know, just curious what your thoughts are on all this stuff.",
        "answer": "there are many reasons why everyone will always be upset that everything \"sucks\" \"nowadays\" and it was \"better\" at a \"previous time that i'm thinking of\", but i can tell you 2 very important reasons it may be tempting to feel this way. one very simple reason is that when you listen to music from the past, it has already gone through many years of quality control filtering, and mostly the only surviving items would naturally be the 'better' ones. but if you listen to music in the present, you will hear everything that anyone is trying to do, including the stuff that won't even 'make it' to next week. for example, if you took a time machine to let's say 1975, or 1955 who cares when (you pick a time, it doesn't matter), and you turn on the radio, sure you would hear the classics that you've heard of, but along side that you would hear 3 other songs who are desperately trying to copy that one. listen to some \"air check\" recordings, from any year, it doesn't matter which year, listen to them and i think that should put things in perspective. Also, the other very simple reason why everyone always says that things are never is good as they used to be is just simple nostalgia. everything always seems perfect in the past. we forgive anything for sucking. and finally a 3rd reason even though i only said i was going to give 2, a 3rd reason is if you actually are a musician/artist or someone who deeply wishes to succeed, it can just boil down to jealousy and envy. and i just thought of a 4th reason, people engage in pop-hate as a way to fit in. if you bad-mouth something new, you are less likely to receive resistence because it less likely that that piece has accumulated a sizeable body of respect in society"

It's better to have some positive dialogue with kim jong un, even if it's just about basketball, as opposed to no dialogue at all or only negative stuff. Also, I don't really know what to believe about kim or north korea. All the crazy bullshit we say about them could just be propaganda to make all the americans know who the 'bad guys' are. When 2 countries don't get along, I think it's common for both sides to make up lies and exaggerate to dehumanize the other country and make them seem evil and all that.",

        "question": "12.31.17 4:29 pm Oh, ok. Playing the different modes while keeping the root the same is actually a big help in hearing the different qualities of each one. Thanks! But, wouldn't thinking in terms of modes mostly come in handy when you have a song where the harmony is just kind of vamping on 1 chord for a long time (or maybe multiple chords, but that change slowly.. as in, one chord every few bars or whatever)? I guess it's really important to establish what the root is. Like C lydian is technically G major, so if you want it sound lydian and not like G major, you really gotta focus in on C and F# in the melody and hammer it in that you're not in plain old G major. I guess thinking in terms of modes is mostly useful when you're really going for that specific quality/sound the modes have? The way I was taught it (way back when I was taking lessons still) was to use modes when 'soloing over chord changes'. Like, if you have (to chose a boring, textbook example) a I-vi-ii-V in C, that you think ionian over the I, aeloian over the vi, dorain over the ii and mixolydian over the V. But that was never helpful to me to think in those terms.",
        "answer": "yes, i would say so. a famous example is \"so what\" by miles davis. (dorian). another example would be \"the way you make me feel\" by michael jackson which i just realized is a bar by bar chord rip of \"on broadway\" (mixolydian) or at least before they go to the 4 chord it just vamps on mixolydian. dorian and mixolydian are really the main ones that you are going to find useful in \"music.\" lydian, like i said, comes in handy if you want to create the childlike wonder found in the opening of a 1990s steven spielberg movie, and \"ionian\" and \"aeolian\" are just another name for regular major and regular minor. the other remaining 'strange' ones are not so useful because if u are gonna be strange you are better off being strange on your own without restriction just play and see what works i think the point of modes is so we have an easy name for that time when you want a minor scale but u want to keep the natural 6. (dorian). or that time when u want a major scale but you want the flat 7 (mixo). that's the main way modes are used, in the business. and no one ever says 'modes' really, you would just say \"major\", \"minor\", \"dorian\", or \"mixo.\" as far as the sequence of 7 'modes', that's just a red herring, to throw young music students off the trail and confuse them and get them to think they don't understand music when in reality music is as easy to understand as tender lovemaking ew, that's terrible advice, when playing over 1,6,2,5 sequence in C, just play in C! more specifically just get used to playing over 1,6,2,5 in C. and like maybe learn how to hit the F note when it lands on the d minor, but your ears (if you have them) should easily point you there. if you are thinking about an entire 'scale' for each chord individually you are going to have a very bad time and the listener will too"

        "question": "Why do song ideas always come to me at the most inconvenient times? When I'm at work, or at the grocery store, or just out in public in general? Whenever I can, I try to write the music down or sing it into my phone ASAP. But when I'm at work, I can't just bust out a pad of staff paper and start writing or start singing into my phone. Or, if I'm on the train or something I don't want to just be singing into my phone when there's all these other people around me. I really feel like (unless it's something really short and really simple) the idea gets lost (or at least altered) if too much time passes between having the idea and trying to record the idea. What do you do when an idea pops into your head and you just for whatever reason can't record/write it out on the spot? Have you stopped caring about people's reactions and will just whip out a phone or voice recorder and sing stuff on the train or at the store or something?",
        "answer": "ideas are very playful. that is their way of being playful yes you can yes you can. you can do it quietly, and professionally that is 100% true, that's because it's the first time you've heard it. that's why it's so vitally important to document it immediately i have my ways there are ways of doing it quietly and professionally, and if i absolutely can't speak, i can document the idea using text alone, and indicate the notes, rhythm, and chords using an elaborate number system. it's tedious and it takes quite a moment, and autocorrect might kick my ass, but it can be done"

        "question": "Sometimes when playing music I'll use string sounds and wind/brass sounds but I play all the parts myself on piano. (I have a pretty decent keyboard and these parts actually sound not too fake). I'd love to one day actually get to play with some horn players or string players. But it's weird writing for instruments you don't play, because I don't know if these parts are playable. I try to stay in their range but there's a whole lot i don't know about the mechanics of these instruments. Like i don't know how long of a phrase a horn/wind player can realistically play without needing space for breathing in between notes/phrases. How fast certain instruments can play or how long they can hold out notes, can this instrument slide up/down to notes and play in between pitches or is it set pitches, stuff like that. I'm worried that I'll spend all this time writing and finally meet musicians to play these parts and they'll be like \"dude, that's not possible t o play o n this instrument\". I've been on the flip side of this where a piano player has tried to write guitar parts for me, but some of the chord voicings weren't physically possible to play on a guitar.

I get if you're maybe censoring one word in one of the verses or something, but if you're changing the chorus, let alone the title line of the song? C'mon. They change that cake by the ocean song too, they make it say 'crazy crazy' (whatever that means) instead of 'fucking crazy.' Do you think we'll ever get past this type of thing, and laugh about it one day? Or are songs on the radio just going to be shat upon forever?",
        "answer": "i can understand that i agree, that song is one of the more tragic censorship cases that's true, 'fuckin crazy' is so much more rhythmically effective in that spot. i think in that case, \"frickin crazy\" would have been a much better choice, for the censorship i don't fully understand why certain words still remain illegal on the radio. it seems like some kind of weird social experiment"

It seems simple - \"just answer the question, and that answer is the thing that motivates you\" - but that's not the problem. I know why I need to do it. I know that doing the thing, whatever it is, is the most logically, emotionally, and/or spiritually satifying thing I can do right now, the thing I'll look back on and say \"I'm glad I did that thing.\" It is the best thing to do in every regard, except one: doing the thing will make the right now go from being okay to feeling sucky, and that just sets the rest of my brain in a tizzy, and I try to fight against it but my inner fatass always wins. So, Bill Wurtz, I ask you, how do I garner the mental power to stop my griping and groaning and just do the sucky thing already?",
        "answer": "your 4th sentence is your motivation to do the thing. your motivation not to do it is that it is 'sucky.' i actually don't quite understand the task if you've described it as satisfying in so many ways, but then you described it as sucky. the good news is, if you want to do it you can do it, and if you don't want to do it you don't have to. but if you are having trouble deciding, perhaps you could go white water rafting and that might help you think a bit faster"

        "question": "I'm trying to write out some music... how would you write out something where you hold out notes, but add notes on top? Like for example if I wanted to play like a Cmaj appergio, playing the C on beat 1, E on 2, G on 3 and C and 4.. but I want the notes held out (so a whole note on C, dotted half note on E, etc)? When I plug a whole note into my software it doesn't let me add any other notes because I think the software thinks that I want to add the notes after 4 beats of the whole note and not while it's ringing out, but maybe I'm writing it wrong. How would you write that out (by hand)?",
        "answer": "i can think of 3 ways, none of which are that great. make like 4 parallel universes, and put everybody's notes and rests in, as if there are 4 players sort of borrowing the same staff. if you want to convince a music program to do that, try making different 'voices'? it's a hassle, that's why handwriting is always easier. the next choice would be to tie everything over, and it would look like bigger and bigger stacks. this would be accurate but kind of a mess to read at first glance because it looks like stacked chords. and of course the other way is to just write 4 quarter notes going up and then write something on the top like \"sustain\" or \"please don't let go\" or something"

        "answer": "hold on a second. i feel like i'm going insane here. it seems like every day people ask me to talk about 'music theory' which i think is a misleading term anyway, but i feel like everyone is constantly asking me to talk about it and i feel like i am constantly reminding people that it is all meaningless unless you are considering the way the music ACTUALLY SOUNDS. i feel like i say this over and over again. the question you are originally referring to was someone who was complaining about 'errors on my site' but actually they were talking about what they perceived to be errors in the code, which actually didn't effect the user experience. so i pointed out that i don't think these should be viewed as errors if they don't actually effect the user experience. i want to be clear that i feel EXACTLY the same way about music, and sometimes i feel like a slalom skier trying to dodge all these 'music theory' questions that try to make music out to be something that lives on the page, and sure it's great to be literate but the whole point of it is the way it sounds. so it really drives me crazy that you are blaming me for talking about music code etc when every single time i feel like i have to remind people to return to the way it SOUNDS. so again, let me re-iterate that my views here about music are congruent with the views i said about code, in the other question. i just had to clarify because you are really making me feel insane here and i need to explain this clearly"

        "question": "bill at around 11 seconds into the new video after the line \"or to be like you\" you do a little drum fill with your mouth half open and looking sort of suprised. im wondering was this influenced by other drummers because they sort of do the same thing. for example in the hello goodbye music video at 1.16 https://youtu.be/rblYSKz_VnI?t=1m16s ringo starr does the same thing, suprised with a slightly opened mouth while doing a drum fill. were you inspired, or was this coincidental?",

I just use the standard recording program that just came with my computer (audacity).. i dont do anything with effects any editing apart from just adjusting the volumes of each track. I love writing and recording music, but the sound quality is always crap. Doesn't really bother me now.

        "question": "Hey bill. I am kind of a dreamer and I don't quite understand how I developed the mindset I did, being surrounded by so many people who think differently than me, but I'm really happy I did. I just believe more that everybody's special and should do what they want to do in life, regardless of their status and that they have the power to achieve that. But each time I bring this up, my whole family tries so hard to bash into my head that this is the wrong way to approach the world and it really upsets me because I believe that my approach to the world is how one can achieve creation and innovation. Like if we had accepted how things were and never strive to change, us as a human race wouldn't be where we are now. And it saddens me when people around me try soooo hard to force me to think like what they do- don't stand out and accept things the way they are and so much bullshit in my opinion. I look up to a lot of people that inspire me, like you, and s o many o thers, and all the great things that surround me in my life that give me hope that I could push foreword and prove everybody around me wrong. That I can live the life I want, and that I could potentially make it and be like you or my other inspirations and bring more great things to the rest of the world. It's my main motivation in my life at the moment. But it's really hard with so many people surrounding me like this- telling me I shouldn't think this way. I don't agree with settling any less and living someone else's life and wasting what makes me unique and great. It's just difficult to find the time to put my energy into what I want to do with the many responsibilities I have already and With all of these people trying so hard to change me. I know my situation may not seem that bad, but It's kinda driving me crazy. Stressing me out. Sometimes my hope dwindles because of this. I want to breakthrough and prove all of these people wrong, but it's always inevitable that my energy a lways crashes and my hope fades and I fall apart. My question is how do you push through when it seems that the world around you is so against you? What advice do you think would help me Persist?",

        "question": "I think the lines about the windmills in La de da de da de da de da de day oh is similar to its corresponding lines in the first two verses, \"Where did all the good times go\" is self explanatory, \"Where did all the bad times roll\" sound as if you are wondering where the bad times came from, and \"when did all the windmills start to turn so slow\" is like a metaphor about how the wind has stopped, like the good times stopping. At least that's my take on that line. You said it just fits but I think it actually makes sense.",
        "answer": "they way i heard it, it could actually mean 2 things. it could mean the windmills were previously going fast and they recently started going slow. or it could mean that they were previously not moving, and they recently started turning (slow). i can also tell you that as i was writing the choruses, thinking of various swap lines for \"where did all the good times go\" .. my brain kept feeding me \"when\" .. as in La de da de \"when did all the ? ? ?\" but nothing seemed to fit. the windmill line was a perfect solution for this because it allows me to use \"when\", but because the line starts a little earlier it also allows me to land on \"wind\" at the same time that \"when\" would have been if the line were the normal length"

        "question": "ok so here's a fun fact, and some fun information you would like to know about having a discord server. now that you have one, you can make it function however you like. you can have multiple conversation channels for different types of conversation, (maybe a separate channel for the mods, a separate channel for talking about sensitive topics, a separate channel for pasting the rules of the chat, to explain to the people how each channel is designed to be used, etc.) . also you can have voice channels, where people can talk to each other. you can have as many as you like, and call them whatever you want. you can also put them in any order. another fun thing about discord is \"roles\", you can give create little tags which can allow the person access to whatever channels you set it to, and you can make their name whatever color you want. you can set roles that can change other roles, create channels, move channels, all sorts of shenanigans you can give people a ccess to or not. finally, to open it up to the public, simply post an invite link somewhere on your webpage, or somewhere like on your twitter. you can set these invite links to expire, or not. it's all up to you. that's a discord crash course, i hope it made sense, if there are any questions, just let me know and i'll get back to you somehow!",
