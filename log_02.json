        "question": "What are your thoughts on the fact that \"communism\", \"socialism\" and other left-wing ideologies have been watered down to mean something completely different than what they did originally? I mean, people run around calling The Soviet Union, Mao's China, Cuba and other dictatorships \"Communist\", but if you actually look into the roots and main principles of communism, it's obvious that these regimes were far from communist. Communism is mainly about DECENTRALIZATION of power, which is completely opposite to what happened in the USSR. So-called communist dictatorships weren't communist, but actually OPPOSITE to being communist. They had massive centralization of power, which is THE OPPOSITE of what real communism calls for! For fucks sake.",

        "answer": "this one didn't really take longer than expected. i knew the project was ridiculous when i started. but it needed to be done, because japan was not supposed to be the main course. this one is the main course. i hope that makes sense. after this i can move on to many other different types of videos, of a range of different lengths, but probably no longer than 6 minutes. the japan one feels way too long actually. the one i am doing now is an exception, and you will see why. besides that, i am way behind on song releases. i have wanted to do weekly songs since 2013, and i started in 2014, but was doing so many videos at the same time, videos took over. so songs/music will be a 1st priority after this video is done. but there will be videos too, many different kinds. also some other things"

        "question": "sorry this is a long/multipart question. i think it's a little silly and maybe a deliberate misdirect to say you don't care about 'politics' or aren't 'political' in some sense, and i think it's pretty clear in many of your videos. i mean, a lot of your videos are about critiquing corporate culture and consumerism by appropriating corporate language and musical techniques and juxtaposing them with surreal or humorous circumstances in order to reveal corporate society's perverse absurdity. take, for instance, your \"sponsor movie\" video, which involves you scream-singing \"coke\" for around thirty seconds, which quite pointedly reveals the insane and almost violent aspects of advertising, or \"how about going to the mall?\" where you sing a fake and repetitive advertisement from \"ShitMall\", which i feel leaves little to no ambiguity for how you feel about malls and advertising. of course, you've also communicated your anti-advertising and anti-cor porate stances in the past on this very questions page, citing them as a reason why you won't turn on advertising on your youtube videos. there are numerous other examples in your videos: \"colonization\" has you singing the word \"colonization\" over the image of a U.S. city skyline, implying that, indeed, the U.S. city is a product of colonization and colonial life; \"jazz america\" has you improvising over a scrolling neon text of the U.S. declaration of independence, a choice which could have a number of interpretations but isn't exactly politically 'neutral'; the christmas video is another send up of corporatism which encourages viewers to \"stay home from work to be with your family\" while reassuring them not to worry because \"the people that work in the 24 hour stores will still go to work\", including the corporate logos of mcdonald's, walgreen's, and *foxconn factories*, highlighting a hypocritical imbalance central to capitalism and consumerism; the japan video take great pains to 'correct' us and inform us that only \"rich important people hired samurai. poor people who could not afford to hire samurai did not hire samurai\". i am listing/analyzing so many examples in order to illustrate that your interest in the struggles of those exploited by class systems and the absurdity/horror of consumerism/corporatism are continuing, multi-year topics of interest that appear in many of your videos, topics which are hardly that of someone who \"do[es] not have any opinion on politics\". it's part of why i personally enjoy a lot of your work so much. i can understand wanting to let your work speak for itself, or being coy about your views in order to protect your privacy or to protect against internet backlash... but unless you're being ironic or satirical in your answers below (which is perfectly understandable, many of your videos have ironic and satiric elements) or are using a particularly narrow definition of politics, then i can't quite make heads or tails o f what y our videos and songs say you believe versus what you say you believe. so for the actual questions part: what do you mean when you say you \"do not have any opinion on politics\"? what is your definition of what is \"political\" or not? are my interpretations of your videos valid or not, in your view? were you trying to critique corporate culture in some of these videos? if not, if you were \"trying\" to \"do\" anything with these videos, what were you \"trying\" to \"do\"? are you \"trying\" to \"say\" anything with your work at all? what is your view on \"interpretation\" and criticism in general? how do you feel about your audience trying to \"interpret\" your work? what are you views on issues of class and the struggles of \"the people that work in the 24 hour stores\"? thank you for reading and maybe answering this long-winded question. i hope you have a good day.",
        "answer": "i think politics is a weird word and i am not sure what it is really supposed to mean i didn't realize that was called politics, i sort of thought politics is like when you care about which of the 2 eligible contestants will win a campaign for presidency, or something like that it's really like if you are on a long car ride and your brother keeps kicking your seat, and he will never, never, never, never stop and also doesn't seem to hear you asking him to stop. it's not so much a political view but more just losing your mind eventually, and drawing interpretive paintings about the eternal kicking wow, what an incredibly thorough, world class, razor sharp, psychiatric-grade analysis. i hope you have an opportunity to do this professionally in some capacity if you don't already i did not know that is called politics. i thought politics was when someone promises that they have the ability to somehow 'fix' those issues i think that is generally a good strategy oh hell yeah 23,000 questions will do that to you i don't have a firm definition of politics, (which is probably why i stay away from it) but from what i can tell it usually means people with great public speaking skills trying to convince audiences to elect them. seems legit, but it is not something i am terribly interested in. if politics happens to be the name of something i am interested in, then i would prefer to call it something different, because it seems like the word politics has come to be associated with failure, confusion, and frustration. ridiculously perceptive and thorough. i am extremely impressed. you might know me better than i do i am glad you put those words in quotes because i usually prefer to let things try to do themselves, and i just go along for the ride i leave it to the interpreter to have a view on interpretation. or better yet, i leave that to the interpretation interpreter. if i spent time thinking about how people think about what i've done, i wouldn't have time to do the work in the first place some people forget that those people are people. in fact many people forget many people are people"

        "question": "Hey, \"The friend is me\" guy here. I never really thought about it in those terms, as far as which thing terrifies me less. Thinking back, I would definitely say that doing shorter things is much less terrifying, and also I can actually DO it in the first place. Longer things sap energy directly out of my soul when I try to do them, and that makes me wonder if I'm doing it wrong. The problem I'm currently having is that while I can make as many short things as I want, they all contain extremely personal info and I do not feel comfortable showing them to most people. I've tried to transition to something that doesn't feel as awkward to share, but I'm afraid that along the way it will all fall apart and I will be buried by the resultant avalanche of crippling self-doubt. My inability to get all this to \"click\" together is driving me insane. How do I avoid going insane in this way? (sorry for this super-long question btw)",
        "answer": "these sound like the thoughts of someone who knows they are supposed to make it. the great news is, you will probably not be able to focus on anything else until you make it. you will spend every day trying to find ways to get this together. there is no escaping the fact that you are going to get it together. just remember that any way is the right way. you should see some of the dumb things i tried when i first started. oh wait, you can because i posted them all online"

        "answer": "the 2 reasons were 1. urggh, i just wanna make so much stuff, i'm just bursting with the desire to make so much stuff but i don't know when/where to start (kind of like that person from a few questions ago). ok that's it i can't take it any more, 5 things a week, like this every week, from now on. (months go by) this is going great but i never have time to do anything long, because i have to always do 5 a week. 2. (one year later) ok great now i have made plenty of short stuff, and i am So done with short stuff, forget the 5-day, time to do long stuff yay. dammit, just got really popular on vine and it's more followers than i've ever seen anywhere, but i was just getting ready to do long stuff. this is awkward the first reason was ready to be obsolete by the time the second reason kicked in, and the second reason became obsolete as soon as i found an equal or bigger following on a platform that allows any time length. i hope that makes sense"

I feel like I better understand myself from agreeing or disagreeing with you and then trying to understand exactly why I do, and what that entails. I have a question! You seem to very adamantly hold the perspective that art either can only be made or is best made out of seeking relief from an uncomfortable intensity of personal emotion, such as frustration, sadness, or joy. The intensity drives one to make art, sends one past a \"breaking point.\" In this way, art is a very personal and perhaps not at all altruistic practice. That said, art can have a profound impact on the life of others. I, for example, can claim to have an enriched life because of your work, from your videos to this question page. Should a desire to please or benefit others ever enter the equation in an artistic venture, in your opinion? What if a desire to please others IS that aforementioned strong emotion?",

        "question": "Sorry this is so long, I've just had a bunch of questions I've wanted to ask and I figured I might as well ask them all at once. From what I gather, the reason you don't collaborate is because you have a specific artistic vision (and a very specific style) for everything you do, and it would be very difficult to get someone else to use the same style or approach your work with the same vision. Is there more to it than that? Is that assumption even partially right? If so, what about collaborating on research for the History of Japan-style videos? I can't see how the style of presenting info would affect it. Is it just trustworthiness? Also, am I right in assuming that one of the biggest priorities when designing this website is making it load as quickly as possible (since you mentioned you don't want to use graphics)? or do you just prefer taking a minimalistic approach only because you like how it looks? Also, if that's the case (minimalism and no graphics), how come you have a PayPal GIF hidden away at the bottom of your main page? Doesn't that run counter to the way you designed nearly every other page of this site? As a side note I love the way this website is designed. Don't worry if someone tells you it's ugly or poorly optimised or whatever, because in terms of just loading time it's the most optimised site I visit, and the style isn't ugly, its just very distinctive and its kinda representitive of the style you use in some videos (and of your preference for how you want to display and sort your work). If someone asks a question with spelling mistakes do you ever correct them? (so that the viewers can understand it) If someone leaves their email or personal info in a question would you/do you ever remove it without their asking? If I wanted to ask multiple questions, would you prefer a huge message like this, or would you rather have someone ask multiple questions seperately? (if it's the second one, sorry!) Thank you for your time!",
        "answer": "you might be right it's worse. everyone always feeds you this idea of how sacred and holy collaboration is, (and i agree with it), always pointing to the great collaborations (lennon/mccartney, etc etc etc). so i always believed that that was important. but there's one problem, what if i don't have any friends? what if i just can't seem to meet anyone who wants to spend their life doing the kinds of things that i'm doing? what if everyone around always wants to just, i dunno, go home and watch the oscars or something. what if i really can't find anyone? so i felt sad and guilty for a long time, thinking that you are supposed to collaborate but i just can't find people cuz i'm cursed or something. and then one day, i saw an interview clip from a very famous and well respected songwriter (i wish i could find the clip, i would post a link to it) that said \"you know, i don't collaborate well. that's one of the reasons i like songwriting, is because it's something you can do all by yourself.\" and that is when it became clear. i had already given up on finding collaborators, but seeing that clip was what made me stop feeling bad about it yes it's kind of like making a good window, for your house. does a good window have fun phrases written on it, and cool pictures on the glass? no. the glass is completely clear, so you can see what's on the other side, with vivid clarity. i hope that makes sense no no yes i used to prefer separate, because to answer multiple questions at once requires me to basically write an entire essay re-stating all the questions, and it is cumbersome mainly for the reader. but then i found an easy way to interject answers into the middle of the question, which makes handling multi-part questions much more reasonable"

        "answer": "no. the foam gets the memories, and it is very short term, and it is only physical. and it would only work if you suddenly became twice as big, the foam would stay small, for a few seconds. it is important to remember that more solid non-foam objects have almost infinite physical memory. memory foam is called memory foam to differentiate it from regular foam, which has no physical memory. this also only applies to physical states which are smaller than its resting state. i hope that makes sense"

        "question": "\u25c7In your \"History of Japan\" video, there were a variety of \"corrections\" that you made (through \"annotations\") after you put the video on youtube. Unfortunately, these annotations are Only available on youtube, meaning the downloadable version on your website is \"More False,\" and therefore to some, \"Not As Good.\" But, I enjoy having a version on my computer! You may have considered some options to prevent a situation where you have to add annotations, but have you considered- Releasing a version that you're satisfied with to the people who read this \"estqunois\" page, so that they can catch the things you might not have, and then incorporating those edits into a \"Final Version\" that you upload to youtube? I know you're not sure about collaborations, but but adding the annotations was a \"Collaboration\" of sorts; And, you seem to be accustomed to the input of the \"people\" on this page already. There are a bunch of problems with this, but it would be an interesting experiment- maybe a shorter Longvideo would work better...? Good luck with the rest of the video.",
        "answer": "in order to get any sufficient results from 'beta viewers,' i would have to release it to so many beta viewers that it would constitute a full blown leak. many of the complaints that people have are things that might only come from 1 in 10,000 people. no matter how many beta viewers view it, there will always be more things for people to notice later"

        "question": "Hey Bill, do you have any advice on how I can recognize chords in the songs in The Real Book sixth edition? I never understand what half diminished or what the seventh of a chord is, and I always forget if the seventh is by default minor/a half step down unless stated otherwise.",
        "answer": "really simply, here are the rules: Cmaj7 is maj 3, maj 7. so C, E, G, B Cmin7 is min 3, min7. so C, Eb, G, Bb C7 (technically \"C dominant 7\") means maj 3 and min 7. so C, E, G, Bb Cdim (diminished symbol is a small circle) is probably just 3 notes, min3 and b5. so C, Eb, Gb. Cdim7 is crazy, it's min3, b5, and double flat 7 which would actually just be a six. so in other words, this chord is stacked minor thirds forever. it is sort of a dizzy feeling and was mainly used in like the 1930s i guess? really old stuff etc. C half-dim (a circle with a line through it) is Cdim but a regular FLAT7 not a double flat 7. so C, Eb, Gb, Bb. Another name for this is Cmin7b5 which is a more complicated sounding name, but more clearly states what is actually in the chord. i think realbook usually calls it Cmin7b5. this is the one you will usually see as part of a 2-5 in a minor key. so in the key of Cmin you would commonly see Dmin7b5, G7(b9), Cmin. or something like that. ok that's the general rules, now, rule #2 is, never play the root note in the chord, swap it out and let the bass play it. and also make sure you always change the octave of all the notes so it's comfortable. so for example, play C maj7 like this: C in the bass, then G below middle C, then B below middle C, then E above middle C. and Fmaj7 would be F in the bass, then A below middle C, middle C, then E above middle C. get used to flipping all the chords around so they are comfortable in the middle range, and leave out the bass. step 3 is to vamp through the chord changes in like a simple sort of bossa nova groove, (because it's simple and probably works for anything) no melody, just vamp the chord changes in this way. take your time, and follow the rules. now play every song in the book that way and GET READY TO REALIZE STUFF"

That might feel logical to you and I understand your innocence, but that still looks irresponsible as there are already 20 million views affected by the wrong pronunciation. You can still officially apologize to the world about your decision itself to choose chose a wrong YouTube source, instead of simply showing the source link.",
        "answer": "i did not make a decision to choose the wrong pronunciation. i made the decision to google \"baekje pronunciation\" and click the Large Prominently featured result. if you want to talk about responsibility to millions of people, you should perhaps get in touch with that pronunciation channel which is misleading the entire internet by advertising pronunciation help which is actually fake robot pronunciation. perhaps also complain to google for featuring their channel so prominently, instead of a reliable site, which so far i have not found, due to the rampant prevalence of fake robot pronunciation sites"

        "answer": "i have not seen that scnene, but there is sales tax in new york. so a 50 cent candy bar in a store would likely be priced at about 54 cents. sales tax in new york is complicated and has multiple layers, city tax, state tax, there is an exception for food, but candy is an exception to the exception, and it is sometimes raised over time, but all things considered i would guess that the final retail price of a 50 cent item, after tax, in new york city during the 1990s, would be rounded to 54 cents. 2 quarters and a nickel, and ignoring the 1 cent change (which is common behavior) would fully justify the scene"

        "question": "What is something you wonder?",
        "answer": "i wonder how people find a reasonable workflow when exporting files out of blender. from what i understand, when you export a file, it drops into a certain folder with no prompt for name or location, and automatically overwrites the previous export. so if you are exporting a lot of files, you have to manually open up a window, and change the name to something else, and also there is NO prompt to warn you if you are about to overwrite. so even if you have the guts to go in and open up the window to choose a new freakin name every time, YOU are responsible for keeping track of what names you have used, or else you risk overwriting a file. the way i see it, there are 2 reasonable ways this could work: number append, or prompt and warn. prompt and warn would be like you have to name the file before save it and if you choose a name that has already been chosen it says WAIT hold on you already named something that. number append would be fine also, that's what cameras do -- it means it never asks you to name your pictures, it just automatically names them with a number after it, 1 number higher each time, so you are never bothered to name your pictures, and never risk overwriting. Now imagine this horrific situation: imagine if your camera names your first picture \"picture.\" and then you take a second picture and it names that picture \"picture\" also, and deletes the first picture. UNLESS you open up a window before you take each picture and come up with a name before you take each picture, and oh by the way it is not going to warn you if you are choosing a name you have chosen before. so you are responsible for keeping track of what names you have used, or else you risk wiping out previous pictures. From what i can tell, this is the behavior blender uses when exporting files. now i'm sure blender is fine, and many people use it, and i'm sure there is a reasonable way to work on projects and export files on a regular basis and not risk having them be constantly wiped out if you don't manually name them something different each time AND keep a manual running record of all the names you used ..... but i don't know how it would be done. i abandoned that program long ago because of this issue, but it still remains a deep existential conundrum as to how blender users actually would deal with this. that is what i wonder"

        "question": "Hi Bill, I would like to talk to you concerning your \"history of japan\" video. Why have you glossed over the atrocities Japan has committed, which are major events in Japan's history? Examples include the Rape of Nanking, the South Korean Comfort Women, and the human testing conducted on Chinese civilians. These are important issues that cannot be forgotten. However, they are not present at all in your video, which has been viewed over 16 million times. This is encouraging the ignorance of the \"darker side\" of Japan's history. While countries such as Germany have deeply apologized for their war atrocities and engrain these events in teaching history to their students, the Japanese government has refused to apologize and Japanese textbooks are being revised to omit these events. I sincerely believe that you are a very learned and good person, thus I hope that you are aware of this and that with your large following and outreach, I hop e that y ou may also raise awareness of this issue. Japan's war atrocities are not to be glossed over. Happy Chinese New Year.",

        "question": "I just saw your video on Japan. You dont seem to have an email so I'll leave it here. You mentioned that Japan \"conquered Korea\". You should probably change it to \"tried to conquer Korea\" or get your facts straight. This is a very sensitive topic to this day in Korea. Our national heroes fought for freedom and it wasnt for ignorant meme making fools to make fun of. For you to make a video without stating the facts is blatant disrespect and disregard for the many Koreans that have fought for Korea's independance. Many comfort women are still requesting for an apology from the Japanese prime minister, Abe, an asshole that calls them prostitutes. A country cannot be considered developed if it doesnt owe up to its mistakes. So, in conclusion, fix yours.",
        "answer": "i can't change a youtube video. also, once a project is done i don't change it. it is more important to move forward to other projects the video is supposed to be a fun and crazy time. i am sorry if you did not have a good time. hopefully you may like some of my other videos. if not then you don't have to watch them. there are some other channels that go into those issues in more depth. as you may see from my other videos, that is not really what my channel is all about. please stay away from my videos if you don't enjoy them. it is also important to remember that in that particular video, i used a lot of metaphors (like 'ipads' in the year 1000!) so perhaps if i said 'conquer' maybe 'invade' would have been more accurate? again, razor-sharp fool-proof plain facts is not really what my videos are about. check out some of my other videos and i think you will see what i mean. maybe at some point i will make a video about korea that makes the japanese mad. it is not my goal to make anyone mad, i am just trying to make fun videos, but if millions of people see a video, chances are someone might be mad about something and i am sorry that had to be you. but please stay away from the channel if it is not right for you"

I dunno, I just don't understand why they're formatted the way they are. Some of them are just so tiny, so minuscule, that I have to wonder why it even has it's own page?

        "answer": "it had been years since i had done any recordings, and i didn't have any of the programs i had had before. but having programs never helped anyway. so i just decided to get wicked high and make some recordings using whatever i had, and try to make obnoxious decisions along the way. i made 4, all on june 28 and 29, 2009. it was kind of the gateway for using obnoxious tactics to overcome writers block. i also began doing that with songwriting around that time as well. i hope that makes sense"

        "question": "How did you go about animating the notation in your classic \"the high class stuff\"?",
        "answer": "i will explain a single page first (the multi-page spread is another issue)... let's say there is just one page of notation, like 8 bars or whatever.... I make the notation in a notation program, and screenshot it. (then i actually make several alignment adjustments in graphics, because notation programs are incredibly finicky, it's easier to adjust things in graphics)... then i save it how i want. then i use graphics to erase the last note (and any chord that goes along with it.) i erase notes on a staff by just dragging empty staff over it. and i \"save as\" and then add a 1 to the file name. repeat, keep erasing the next note and 'save as'. then you have a stack of files all in order. then import. then allign the timing. it's the exact same way i do text, but with text i type it out and screenshot each frame, and delete words (easier, instead of erasing them). the delete technique would not work in a notation program, because the notes and alignment will change as you delete them. that's why i use graphics. it's not that hard, and i'm not even using a graphics program. just an image preview program, and i'm just copying and pasting boxes. the mccartney video was a bit more ambitious because i wanted to do a steady scroll. so i thought it would be good to make one huge image file that is the entire length of the score. and then do the erase per frame technique.... so then all the frames were huge... and then export that to a really high res video and scroll the video??? i don't remember if this was successful, but you run into major problems when you try to do huge things like that. processing power limitations, etc. Same sort of crisis occured when i was trying to do the zoom out on the japanese army. i ended up having to somehow break the task into smaller pieces. if i recall. i somehow succeeded in getting a steady scroll on the notation, only to find out that it was too hard to read when it's moving like that!! so i ended up keeping it still and then sliding forward page by page. if i had known the steady scroll wasn't going to work, i probably would have broken it into pages from the start"

I mean, if you're happy with the progress you're making right now, an extra pair of hands might get in the way of your creative process. However, if there's other projects you'd like to finish as well, but can't because you're too busy with this gigantic History of the Universe video, don't you think it's worth the mild sacrifice of creative control? I'm asking this not as some impatient fan but as someone who can't imagine crafting one youtube video for multiple years in a row.

And I stare at him. And he says \"I like your shirt, man. I've listened to Abbey Road so many times. Rock on\" and I just keep staring at him and I look to my grandma and to him and I'm sure I looked like I was going insane and then he starts talking again and he's like \"I even love that stupid octopuses garden song\" and I'm like \"bill?\" And he's like \"what\" and my grandma is like \"no it was the other guy in the Beatles who wrote that song\" and then he gets in an argument with my grandma about who wrote that song and I'm just standing there watching him scan my grandmas adult diapers and scream at her and in my head I'm thinking \"THIS IS BILL FUCKING WURTZ or possibly his twin brother that lives in Florida AND HE KNOWS ALL THE SECRETS TO THE UNIVERSE\" because he was winning the argument and I assumed he knew everything else as well. and basically: this shook me, bill.",
        "answer": "i don't say rock on, and i'm not terribly interested in abbey road. in general, the points of interest for me on that record are 'her majesty,' 'maxwell silverhammer,' 'she came in thru the bathroom window,' 'polythene pam', and the wild items list in the verses (not the chorus) of 'come together'. but unlike ryen, i am not too interested in the entire album"

        "question": "Can you drop some more mad hints and give us an idea on how close you are to finishing the new History of [blank] video? The last one that really gave us an idea of the progress you made was a checklist comparing it to the one for history of Japan.",
        "answer": "the 'graphics' phase was finished on feb 7. after that, the process is a little bit more confusing to explain. it's a lot of smaller things -- final narration, jingle vocals, editing jingles and narration, mixing, re-alignment to fit final narration timing, and the score. the score is the most subtantial item of all of those, but not as large as 'graphics.' it is hard to exactly explain the process because i have been bouncing around depending on whether it's day or night (vocal recording, etc) and also i was sick and had lingering sick voice for a couple weeks, so during that time i made an early detour into doing the score, somewhere around feb 19. so i basically locked up the narration timing up until 7:50 (that was as far as i had gotten) and started on the score. by the time i reached 7:50 in the score (this was around march 2 i guess), i was able to resume vocals, and was bouncing around between doing jingles and narration. narration is now solidly in place with correct timing, video re-alignment to fit that new timing is done, now starting on the rest of the score, from 8min to the end. once the score is done, it is just the small little tasks like year labels, other labels, graphics adjustments, mixing, etc etc etc but these small tasks tend to fly by very fast, and once the score is done it tends to be a slippery slope to the end of the process. this is what i know from experience on doing the previous long video of this type. i hope that makes sense"

        "question": "I know the new vid is comin', so i will ask about something else. peanut butter song: you recorded the jar hits on to a MIDI track and then just moved the notes to form the major and then add 9 chords, right? It seems more practical than just playing chords in sync or trying to re-sync 'em. just that. keep it awesome and hellyeahish.",
        "answer": "the song was actually recorded around early 2010. it was called \"this song yeah\" and it's hardly a song, it's just me slamming a major chord several times in a row. During 2014, as part of the weekly content schedule, one of the videos each week is supposed to be a 'music video' which is when you make a video to go along to a song that's already recorded. so for a thrill, i decided to try an instrumental song. i picked \"this song yeah.\" the idea that worked best was a jar of peanut butter. when the video was done, it only made sense to change the title. most of the time i aim for strict musical accuracy in my videos, because it is usually more thrilling, especially for musician viewers, but in this particular video the notes are ignored. mainly because it is impossible to play a major triad with a peanut butter jar"

Or do you not care what others think, and care only to work at a pace that suits you? Or perhaps a combination of both?",
        "answer": "there is pressure from all sides. some people want the video to come out sooner. some people want me to work less, and 'take vacations.' some people want me to give opinions about the latest films and tv shows. some people want me to make more short videos. some people want me to make songs. some people want me to make more journal clips. some people want me to answer more questions. some people think i answer too many questions. some people want me to collaborate with their favorite artists. some people want me to make videos for their business. these are some of the many kinds of pressure i receive on a daily basis but the only kind of pressure i pay attention to is the pressure that was present before any of those, which is whoops i have no social life but my mind has been exploding for as long as i can remember, and it needs to be put on display ASAP in as many ways as possible until people understand"

After about 100 songs, if you are still alive, then you can start going back and improving some of them, and by then i think you will have much broader experience of what works and what doesn't, and you will be much better able to hunt down the right solutions for each unique song. improving songs is a tricky game, every song is like a sick baby with its own special disease"

Use a voice memo app (most phones have them) and be quick and professional about how you frame it. establish where the root of the key is, establish where the time is, and correctly count it off, so there is no confusion about where the key and time are oriented. any hints about the groove or tempo are also very helpful, (perhaps compare it to another song's tempo, if that helps) and any other hints about how the idea is oriented in the song ('this is the top of of the chorus' or 'this would the the end title line of a chorus' or 'this would be a verse line' or any other hints you can think of). and if there are any specific chord things, mention that too, like if you know the whole thing starts on the 4 chord, or something like that. but most importantly remember to orient the key (sing a quick do re mi reference or something) and properly count off the time, and sing the thing, preferably a couple of times. overall your total demo + description should be about 15 to 20 seconds"

At first I will be trying to find ideas to advance the project but I then begin to think of other art-ish things that have little or no relation to the project I am currently working on (like going from writing a poem to thinking of musical riffs). I understand this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it becomes a problem when I need to get a project done (I am a student). Any advice you can give about this?",
        "answer": "try much shorter projects first, they are much easier to finish, and you will get some practice and hone in on your process. then when you are ready you can move to longer projects, and you will complete them handily because you will know what you're doing by that time"

Usually, I follow the same kinda mindset as you've said before of \"trying to fit the chord/instrumentation that supports the melody/song at the time\" (I think, it's been a while!) But I haven't been able to ever make a trill on either a brass instrument or a piano or keyboard to sound anything but really really jarring against the rest of the song... In your song \"this is a song for my next album\" you end the song with a really excellent trill on a keyboard that just Feels So Natural to the rest of the track! I absolutely know that I should be looking to find the instrumentation that supports the track as best as possible rather than Trying To Fit something that doesn't belong (as like forcing yourself to shoehorn a particular chord) but I feel like at this point there's just something that I'm fundamentally missing with my executi on of a trill that always leads to it clashing Every Time. Any ideas on what might be my issue, or any tips that might help point me in the right direction? Thanks!",

        "question": "I saw your response to that guy on 1.18.17 11:02 pm asking about the real book chords. not having much keyboard experience i thought your idea of just playing all the songs was amazing and i gave it a shot. after playing about 30 of them i have a few questions 1. #9 chords are kind of bothering me. am i supposed to play with the minor second clash right next to each other or spread it out, because it sounds better spread out but a lot of times i can't get to that position fast enough. 2. same for 11s and 13s whats a good way to voice them? 3. i've just been doing block chords so far and that has been challenging enough. How do I play these charts in a more realistic groove (you mentioned bossa nova and I have no idea what that is) 4. what kind of situations do I leave out the fifth? I realized that I specifically always include it but i've heard from other places that its kind of an optional note thanks! already i've been realizing stuff and its amazing",
        "answer": "i would say the default way to play, for example, E7#9 would be (listed from low to high) g#, d, g. (left hand takes E, the bass) there are many different types and situations. perhaps you could give me a specific example just play something in time, so you can feel the time. sometimes there's 1 chord in a bar, sometimes there are 2. if you are just playing the chords with no time, then the song won't make sense at all. use whatever groove is the simplest and most comfortable for you, but also doesn't bore you just try and see what works best where"

        "question": "What other non-car tests do you do on your songs, if any?",

Also, a new type of test, which unfortunately is now a reality, is the bassless test. listen to your song on a device which has fucking no bass (such as the built in speakers on a smartphone, tablet, watch, whatever.) and no, you will not hear any bass, but it may add some perspective as to how to make sure the song still stands, in a bassless world, which weirdly enough is becoming more commonplace. and yet, systems with bass are still widespread, and the game is entirely different depending on whether you have bass or not. but you need to make sure your song succeeds in both games. It's like writing a TV show, but then when you're done you have to make sure the show also makes sense if you delete one of the characters. weird, but i guess it's a fun challenge. i have actually never really done the bassless test for a song, too afraid to admit its importance. but it is important and i will do it in the future. for fucks sakes they used to make records on balls of wax, and they liked it"

        "question": "I have analyzed your song \"New Canaan\" and came to the conclusion that the song is about a guy who's going to prison and he's addressing to his daughter that he killed. My evidence is 1. you like singing about jail/prison 2. there is a federal prison in Pennsylvania called \"Canaan\" 3. the narrator is unreliable as he suffered a nervous breakdown as told by \"I'm going crazy\". 4. He's riding on a train (on his way to prison) and he's hungry for food and women (he's not gonna see a woman again any time soon) 5. He talks about \"loving the shade of those license plates\" i.e. he's making license plates, a stereotypical prison job. My theory is that he loved his daughter and went crazy before killing her and his nervous breakdown only got worse as he got sentenced to life in prison so he wrote this song to say what he wants to tell his dead daughter whom he loved dearly. As he's \"talking\" to his daughter, he feels the need as a father to protect her from the truth, and \"lies about details\" by saying he's \"actually going to connecticut\" At first he tries to convince himself that it's all for the better and that he's happy, evidenced by how he says he hopes the train doesn't get derailed, and how \"the season is winter, and the sky is so blue\" but gradually comes back to reality and understands the severity of the situation, as line \"it's summer and the sky has turned grey and my dreams are sailing away\" indicates he has spent enough time in prison for the seasons to change. On a scale of 100% to 100%, how close is my interpretation? P.s. I know you said you wrote the song after picking New Canaan as a random town to take the train and wrote the song on the way there. I just don't buy that such poetry would have such a straightforward explanation.",

        "question": "Hey Bill, I've been checking up on your questions page once a week for a couple months now. Right off the bat I was fascinated not only on how you function as an artist, but in your day-to-day life, your \"survival strategy\" if you will. And you even give a specific date on when you stared making videos non-stop save for a one-week break! As an artist myself, this is very inspiring as I feel I've been stuck with a bunch of material written but not recorded. Like... what does one need to do to work on the level your doing? How do I engage this? Is it a personal event, or a simple yet sudden change of mind that causes this paradigm shift (if that's the proper term)?",
        "answer": "you are on the right track. there are a million ways to do things, and that might make your head spin for a while. but eventually when you can't take it anymore, you will start anywhere because it doesn't matter where. and you will learn everything along the way. i could give you more details on how the transition occured for me, but i've surely explained it 100 times on here already"

        "question": "Hey, so I've been reading music for a while now, and I feel like I can read just about anything given five-ten minutes. But now I feel like that's a hurdle to jump since people in the real world may be like \"no. Are you crazy? Ten minutes doesn't exist. Play this thing now or not at all\" so I'm trying excercises where I just flip to a random piece in \"the real book\" and play it as accurately and fast as possible. I find myself panicking and stressing myself out doing this though. So how to not panic? Or is panic is necessary to do better? -Mr. Freak",
        "answer": "start practicing with a metronome. take it as slow as you need so you can actually sight read it. when you run out of tunes, get another book -- try to get one with actual tempo markings so that way you can keep track of what your handicap is, relative to the song's actual tempo, and that way you can very gradually increase the tempo. also a good technique is learning to look ahead. i know that seems crazy but that is really how you get it done"

        "answer": "in general, the verses are 3 keys 'sharper' than the chorus. the verses are in Eb (or Cmin) and the chorus is in Gb (Ebmin) going from the chorus to the verse, they use Eb as a pivot point, because Eb minor exists normally in Gb, and if you arrive at Ebminor but then use Eb major instead, then that sets you up to go forward in an Eb maj key (or Cmin). going from the verse to the chorus they do not use that pivot point, they jump from the G7 (which sounds like it is setting up for Cmin) and immediately go to Bma7 (as b6 of the new Ebmin key)"

        "answer": "i'm actually not familiar with the word auratic i'm not sure i really know what you're getting at i don't think so regardless of what world or paradigm we are living in, we will find ways to express ourselves. the results will range from mundane to magnificent, and surely often be both at the same time and also subject to each viewer's unique perception. i'm not sure if that answers your question. also after 400 years we usually only remember the good shit, so that's why people always think the present is lame by comparison, but it never is"

As to why everyone is bugging you about it, I think that they're placing themselves in your position and are a bit frustrated at the money being squandered for seemingly little reason. People are used to ads. The vast majority of channels have them. They are easily blocked if you so desire and it's believed that about 50% of people do so. It's money being thrown directly into the trash for the sake of martyrdom. I say this to clarify the position, so it's a bit less baffling that people seem to be clamoring for ads.

        "question": "what is the longest question you've ever received? It couldn't be this one, could it? Does this question box have a text limit? Is this question too gimmicky? Is it unoriginal? Are my travels into meta-questions stupid and uncreative? Should I find out next time on Dragon Ball Z? Do you even care enough to read this? Will anyone else even see this? Is 1+1 really two or is it something stupid a first grader would say, like a window? Do you even care? Does anyone else who could potentially see this even care? Is reading this question going to prolong your work time, therefore prolonging the release date of HOTEWIG? Will you answer with a one-word statement like yes, no, or apparently? Should I go beyond the realm of yes or no questions? What even defines a question? What is keeping me from just pushing that \"Ask\" button, and quitting this whole question-making business completely? Why should I expect you have the answer to any of these questions? Wil l you re ward me for my valiant effort to make a really long question or will you let this burn in the depths of the bottom of unanswered question hell? Have many, many other people tried to do this before? Am I just an extremely self-evident smart-ass with too much time on my hands? Will I make an unnecessary history of japan reference? Will you even bother to give this question a green hyperlink? Am I too unsure of myself? Am I too sure of myself? Does this rambling tone sound like nails on a chalkboard in your ears? Will you link this in with the rest of the questions you don't understand? Will asking questions about what you might do prevent you from doing those things? Or am I overly forcing tongue-in-cheek humor beyond what it ever should be? Does being in on the joke make the joke any better? Is this what you imagine the worst possible question could be? Am I approaching the text limit? If there is no limit, is there a limit to how much of my effort and time I can give in to madly sc rawling these stupid-ass rambling inquiries? Do you think this is even vaguely funny? Or is the fact that every single sentence is a question make the whole thing sound like some sort of probe or survey? Do penguins have ankles? How many tangents can I go off of? Did these questions even have a focal point at all for tangents to go off of in the first place? Is this some sort of protection of my self image? Is this whole thing just big questions to myself, revealing the gaping maw that is my self doubt? Am I being way too edgy and self-deprecating? Is the imagined upward sound that signifies the end of a question getting to you yet? Should I care less about how I feel and talk more about you? Or have you already figured out that the only thing keeping this decrepit and threadbare series of questions going is self-satire? Is it getting old? When is/was a good time to stop? Has this record already been beaten by some idiot who fell asleep on the a key? Are you in any way stran gely hon ored at the dedication of this question? Am I retreading ground? Will you even read a single word of this or will you just say (or think) \"wow, what a long letter\"? Is my trying too hard the one thing preventing me from making a good question? How does one even define \"trying too hard\"? Is that even possible? Will you not post this because it won't fit into the webpage? Will you format the text so it's really teeny tiny so it does fit the page? Do you think it's even worth it to try? Would answering my question require you to ignore everyone else's questions? Should I care? Does it really matter whether or not you answer my question in the grand scheme of things? Is that metaphorically zooming out too much? Have you noticed that by now, all the random questions have seeped out, because I'm too tired to even care? Is this too meta? Is it really necessary for me to be asking all these questions? How should I possibly expect for you to know any of this? Have I just been runnin g around in circles for the last 718 words? Are you vaguely impressed that I knew how many words there were or have you just given up reading? Does this constitute an essay? Would I pass a standardized test with this? Can you anagram this block of text? Is this snarky at all? Have I used the word \"or\" too much? Am I asking questions for no reason or am I just very, very confused? Should I end this stupid thing already?",
        "answer": "you wanna check no it's not it does now there are no regulations currently in place for gimmicity not completely not exactly the main things you can find out next time on dragon ball z is what happens next on dragon ball z yes yes yes ? about which part not prolong, but delay, and yes slightly maybe you already have the passion for making this question submission even longer you don't have to expect that you are doing a nice job, i've seen people do this way worse some people have time is valuable. if you have it, that is good, there are many uses for it i'm not sure you seem to have found a good balance not really no, it is very clear to me what is going on usually not you will have to check with the rules and regulations in your area for some jokes, not others. some jokes are solid, so you cannot go inside no probably yes nothing is funny it sounds like a manic episode, but that's ok i'm not sure you will have to shave one and find out the same amount as you went 'on' in the first place so far it has remained quite focused, and on track i don't know what you mean i don't think so no i get hundreds of questions a day, i am used to it you will have to decide for yourself i think the main thing that fuels this is to acheive length while still remaining coherent and not copying and pasting it sounds like you're just getting started whenever you reach the text limit, you will have to stop it has been beaten by long copypastas, before there was a text limit i am proud, of you, not strangely maybe not perhaps both effort has been a central theme to this post, and i think the quantity of questions has actually helped ensure that some of them are 'good' although i don't have a system for determining whether a question is good check with the rules and regulations of how hard you are supposed to try, and then evaluate if how hard you are trying is more than that no it will fit, these pages are split monthly, and there are hundreds, maybe thousands of questions on each page the page can be any size, the only loose restriction is if there is too much text on the page, people start to complain that the page loads too slow. reducing the size of the text would make no difference no no you can care if you want the great thing about the grand scheme is, whichever path you choose can be part of the grand scheme. that's what makes the scheme grand you will have to check with whomever gave you this assignment so far the majority of these questions have been self-referential, and not random you will have to check with whomever gave you this assignment you will have to check with whomever gave you this assignment you can't i'm not counting, but yes it has felt like circles for at least a little while now i suspect you did a word count. or perhaps you lied, for a thrill you will have to check with the rules and regulations it depends what the question was yes but it would take a long, long time and i'm not going to do it no i think if there is a word that it seems like you are possibly over using here, it would be 'too' i think you are very dedicated, focused, and also curious you will have to decide for yourself"

You do this with common structures for questions, as well. I have a great respect for it, because it feels like you're stopping generalization and forcing people to look even harder at things. However, I am in a cognitive science class, and it is teaching me that analogy is fairly specific to humans, and it might be what has allowed us to advance beyond other species. We can apply learned information in a highly abstract way to many facets of our lives when we recognize similar structure, whereas other animals cannot. So now I am torn! What do you make of this?",

B, C#, G, F# are really the notes that we're working with here. also A could be buried in there somewhere but with the harmonica on A# you can't tell. and D# in the bass of course. sounds like a pretty standard D#aug7 (in the key of G#min) with all the usual suspects that you would find in a stevie sort of world"

        "question": "why is it that an ensemble with many instruments in the high range can often sound great, but having more than one bass player is often disastrous?",
        "answer": "the harmonic series is really like a tree. the branches get smaller as they go up, so there can be more of them. but 2 trunks would really never work. play 3rds on a piano starting from around middle C, and get lower and lower. you will hear them stop working at a certain point. this will be about 1 octave above the point where 5ths would stop working, and it would be about 2 octaves above the point where single notes stop working, which is usually the end of the instrument (like around low A on piano, or in my opinion B or C) i've found that the harmonic series actually illustrates this exactly. you'll see thirds appear 2 octaves above the source note. so in otherwords if you play thirds in a certain range, the amount of 'mess' it makes is equal to the amount of 'mess' it would make if you played 5ths an octave below that. or a single note 2 octaves below. that's why heavy guitar riffs often use 5ths, and the bass usually plays the same thing 1 octave below, but in a single note. if you try to play 5ths there it just sounds like an earthquake. another interesting way of illustrating this is if you put distortion on and play 5ths, it often sounds exactly like a single note, 1 octave down. it even works if you play 4ths with distortion. it often sounds like a single note 2 octaves below the highest note. again agreeing with the harmonic series that your 2 notes are a part of"

        "answer": "after experimenting both ways, i firmly believe that i can get much better results if i finish writing the song entirely before recording it. not micro-managing all the instruments choices and parts, but just the melody/chords and other core details, and most importantly the entire road map, beginning to end. do not leave any sections in question. in the studio you are free to have much more fun with sound choices etc if you don't have to worry about where the song goes next, if that's already planned out. this is just in my experience. some people thrive on writing in the studio. i have tried both ways and nowadays i firmly believe that what works best for me is to write to the end first, before even touching the recording."

        "question": "okay, here's the situation. i am trying to listen to 1,000 albums of music this year. i am on track so far. i also want to release five album/ep's and i have each one planned. i am less on track with that, but it still seems feasible. at least, it was until today. today my piano teacher said I should be doing three hours of practice per day, and currently he has five jazz tunes (including one i have to transcribe) for me that I need to know inside out in a month, for an assessment. this would of course be doable and appropriately challenging under normal circumstances, but there is already so much going on, and i don't want to give up any of it. I'm already doing all but the bare minimum of schoolwork i am not passionate about (english, maths), and I don't play computer games or watch TV, but it just seems like there are not enough hours in the day. what is the best way to manage my time so that i can work on Multiple Projects even more swiftly and efficiently than I already am?",
        "answer": "i'm not sure why you need someone else to tell you to transcribe tunes. can't you just decide on your own which tunes to transcribe? better yet, if you already have it on your agenda to listen to albums, why not just transcribe the albums you are listening to instead? also if it is on your agenda to make multiple albums, that is valuable real life musical experience. i don't see why you need to 'practice' for so many hours outside of that. if the piano teacher you mentioned is not willing to work congruently with your already established agenda, then i think those 2 agendas will come into conflict, as you have surely noticed"

        "answer": "exact melody/lyrics, less exact chords, any other important info that makes the song what it is, such as a general recommendation of the tempo/groove, etc. and most importantly, the exact road map. i have posted many of the charts on the site, especially ones from around 2010. but these would not include any updates made during the massive updating finishing sessions i did in 2012-2013, or after. from then on, i have basically transitioned into writing on the computer, using a combination of text files and small memo recordings to demonstrate the song. it's just faster and easier to store and access. i have also never posted a chart for a song that is unreleased choosing songs has been an ongoing disaster, and i have tried a range of solutions and i am not quite sure what strategy i am going to use"

        "answer": "besides the sunrise bit, nothing was deliberately repeated. but since every moment is custom scored, there are naturally going to be certain simple melodic patterns that show up multiple times. there's only so many choices. for example the 345 melody (ex. efg) surely occurs all over the place. also i should mention i have almost no memory of history of japan because i haven't seen it since feb 2, 2016"

Have you always just heard sounds accompanying non-auditory actions in your head? Or did you learn it from somewhere like watching cartoons, for example, which tend to do that a lot?",

        "answer": "ah, that's actually a really good reason. here's my reasoning: i never had an icon or a logo when i made the website. the website was made before the youtube or any of those other channels. i originally wasn't going to use other sites. but i sort of got pressured into it. and all those sites are designed for you to have a profile image, so i had to come up with something. so i never really wanted to use the umbrella, i didn't want to use anything. i just came up with it because i had to use something, and that seemed the most reasonable out of all the options i had. so to use the umbrella on this site seems kind of like taking a step backwards somehow. i would possibly consider doing a favicon but i don't know yet what it would be"

        "question": "How important is music theory? How did you learn it? I love making funky chords on the piano and such but I also wanna know what people are talking about when they add a seventh or sustain a chord and actually be able to play it or be able to work with it. I've been studying sheet music for less than a year now but I still wanna understand things. Thanks for any help :)",
        "answer": "theory is made up. make up your own, but also check in to see how it compares to the theory that others have made up. music works the same regardless of what you call it. but if 2 musicians are working together and they want to talk about what they are doing, sometimes it can be convenient if they have a way to describe what they are doing. that's the only place it comes in handy i learned music on my own, and over time i have been exposed to the various terminology, and everything always sunk in immediately because i was already familiar with what's going on if you have a c major chord (c, e, g) adding a major 7th note means adding B, and adding a flat seventh means adding Bb. it's like if you go up a C scale (c,d,e,f,g etc) and count 1,2,3,4,5 etc, it's the 7th note. which is either B or Bb depending on what mood you're in sustaining a chord just means holding it down. like if you play a chord and don't let go. pianos also have a pedal for this, so you can play the chord and let go but if you are holding the 'sustain pedal' the chord will stay on until you lift the pedal. very handy just keep doing what inspires you and be a magnet. every time you hear someone mention a thing, ask around to find out what it is. chances are it will be something you are already familiar with, but maybe called it something different"

        "answer": "so they get done as soon as possible, so i can move on to the other projects i have consumed enough content to almost explode with inspiration, ideas, jealousy, and desire to make my own content. also to put it in perspective, i am making content as fast as i can and people still tell me every day that i do not make it fast enough, and people also at the same time (like you) tell me every day that i should watch tv and play video games etc"

B# means C, and Cb means B. you might use B# if you are coming up a scale like F#, G#, A#, C, C#. but you can see if we use B# instead, it looks like F#, G#, A#, B#, C# it looks a little neater because we have 1 of each letter, instead of having no B and 2 C's and have to un-sharp and re-sharp the C. same thing the other way, if you are in Gb major, you might prefer to say Gb, Ab, Bb, Cb, Db neatly so you use all the letters in a row, instead of having to un-flat and re-flat the B by going Gb, Ab, Bb, Bnatural, Db. if you are writing on the staff, the advantage of keeping it scalar become even more clear. i hope that makes sense"

        "question": "Hey, it's me, person watching your videos everyday. So, I'm wondering, why did you bring up the sultan of Oman living in Zanzibar? It's pretty funny but seems unrelated to everything else. One of my favourite things about the video is how you make history into an interrelated narrative in which everything mentioned is important. But the Sultan thing seems super random. Thanks!",
        "answer": "there are hundreds, thousands of things that happened in world history, so needless to say it was an insane challenge to figure out what to include and what to cut, and a never ending impossible balancing act. to help stay upbeat and sane in this project, i found it important early on to keep a very light and free attitude about the whole thing. people are surely going to get on my case for 'not mentioning this' and 'not mentioning that,' you can't mention everything that ever happened in one video. so the only way to really keep my shit together was just remember that this is a crazy thing to attempt, so just keep it fun, and don't be afraid to include weird things on purpose, just as a reminder that this is supposed to be fun, to hopefully distract from the fact that it is impossible to actually mention everything. the oman jingle was written in an early draft, and then got cut along with a million other things, but i liked the jingle so much i brought it back. trying to keep the whole thing perfectly balanced with an equal amount of details everywhere is kind of like drawing a straight line in a hurricane. at some point you have to just accept that certain random things are going to have extra details. also once a bit is written and turns out good, it can be hard to let go of. other examples would include the chandragupta/seleucis elephant deal, the robespierre stuff, etc. i had a hundred years war bit that i liked so much i was so sad to cut it, but there was surely already way too much britain/france in the video, and the first thing people usually complain about in history videos is that there's too much europe. so i had to cut it"

        "answer": "the jingles were written in exact detail during the writing process, which includes the exact script, and the exact jingles. jingles are something i can use at any time, and usually if i need to say something boring and i can't think of a way to make it interesting, music might be a good option"

        "answer": "the 5 day schedule was in early 2014 when i decided i was going to start making videos (or a song) 5 days a week, in order to catch up on all the songs i'd written, and also hopefully jumpstart the video making process. 2009 was generally the time that i started writing much more songs, because i realized that anything is possible and you can start anywhere. i also started recording them too (very important if you want them to actually exist) but not nearly as fast as i was writing, and i kept writing more and more as the years went by, and i didn't really catch up on recording until 2014. just kidding i never caught up"

        "question": "Do you ever think about how bacteria are just made of chemistry and reactions but like really smart chemistry that doesn't have to just bump into other molecules randomly? So some weird stuff happened first that no one really knows (maybe it was like an enzyme molecule thing that catalysed a reaction in which another enzyme molecule is made so the more of the substrate it gets to go via it's reaction pathway, the more enzyme there is and then the more it can get substrate and then..) and then one day you suddenly have these bacteria things that are basically mini robots that are programmed to drive to things they can react with - kitted out with state of the art reaction driving and maximising equipment. But they don't choose where they go they just get dragged around by chemotaxis. But then chemotaxis gets really really complicated and the mini robots team up into little groups of robots (by accident) to make eukaryotes and these basically become ultra amazing jellyfish robots and it gets kinda hard to start to see where they're just getting dragged around by chemotaxis and where they're making decisions i mean could you call an insect's behaviour decisions? Then some filler and thanks to some handy processes like evolution and natural selection we get the next gen. supercomputer chemistry that can think and work with other supercomputers to keep doing what it's always done without ever really realising it. Because there was no such thing as realising something. And then the more they work together the smarter they get and eventually the chemistry based supercomputers learn what chemistry is. And then it's weird because the chemical system on a passive level is incredible at chemistry with a super fine tuned system but actively doesn't even understand what chemistry is and is kind of shit at it. So we're kind of chemistry doing chemistry because it means it doesn't have to deal with random stuff on an even better level and it beats entropy even more extravagantly than it did before - using the passive system, that took billions of years to develop by chance, to move individual atoms and make structures like laptops and abstract structu res like music that are too statistically unlikely and should never exist but if you go the long way around to making them by starting with bacteria they do. So I'm just a chemical system that become sentient? Is that supposed to mean something? I guess you could even say chemistry had to be made too from more fundamental stuff. Will AI be like the next level after us? cos it's still chemistry just kinda like it realised what it was and instead of waiting for evolution built a better, faster, smarter vessel for itself. If it wants - if we want. So the universe went from having no purpose and just random stuff to having a purpose. Because we want things does that count as purpose? Idk kinda rambley.",

        "question": "when i listen to \"school\" i think it's a deep statement on human nature, and more specifically, ignorance in a depressing way. school is a metaphor for knowledge in general. the lines \"i don't wanna go to school, because i'm stupid, i don't want nobody tellin me what to do or how to get through this\" to me seem like a statement on how people prefer to figure out life on their own way. they think they can wing it, make it up as they go, improvise. the next lines \"i don't want nobody tellin me how to think, tellin me how to sing, tellin me how to do everything\" really emphasize this point. but in the next lines, the true intentions behind the narrator's willful ignorance is revealed. \"i don't wanna be afraid, of criminals, i don't wanna be afraid, of dangerous politicians\" is the climax of the story. he doesn't want to expose himself to the harsh realities of the \"real world\", which could also be why the song uses the metaphor \"school\", since students are ofte n warned about said \"real world\". \"i don't wanna be afraid of you, or of me, or the truth\" further this point, because scariness is everywhere, and we all wish it wasn't like that, but we know deep inside of us that it is. the last lines, \"said that girl made me feel blue, cause she told me I should stay in school, said that girl made me feel blue, don't go to school\" is a nice closer, in which the narrator turns his nose to people telling him to \"stay informed\" or even perhaps \"grow up\", because all it does is make people sad. do you think this analysis is appropriate? or am i overthinking just a really catchy, danceable song? love your videos, ants just crawled out of my laptop.",
        "answer": "your analysis is nice but it's not quite the way i meant it. my own analysis of this song is hiding somewhere (actually several places) throughout these questions pages, and is about equal in length to yours"

Do you think you will manage to finish the song idea list which started in 2009? Are you going to make a song about something else than USA but in the same categories(I mean other countries like Russia, New Zealand, Latvia)? Using the time between \"history of the entire world i guess\" and \"in california\" I calculated that you will upload approximately 15 songs a year. Do you think this is accurate? If not, do you think you will make more or less? Are you going to make songs about numbers? Even if you made any, are you going to make more? Does the use of the \"Enter\" button make these questions easier to read and operate with? Which is the better place to check the solutions to games or challenges you did not give answer to: the questions page or your e-mail? Does infinity cause glitches in mathematics? For example there is a sum \"1+2+3+4+5+...=-(1/12)\" and the solution makes sense if proper research is done! Which one do you believe to be true: \"quality is better than quantity\", \"quality is as good(or bad) as quantity\" or \"quality is worse than quantity\"? Which one of these strategies do you prefer to follow: \"quality over quantity\", \"quality along quantity\" or \"quality under quantity\"? Thanks for finally uploading the alphabet ordering strategies and being awesome!",
        "answer": "no i've barely scratched the surface the list was actually compiled in 2012, even though the songs date back to 2009. i don't think there would be nearly enough time in my lifetime to finish all of them most of my songs are not about geography not quite more. i wanted to try out a few different techniques with california because it was the first one, so i just wanted to make sure i knew what i was doing. my target is 1 song a week. for many songs that will be a breeze, such as next week's song which is already finished. but for example if i pick one where the writing is only 5% done, and the length is supposed to be 3 minutues, that means i have to write the entire thing and record it. might possibly take up to 2 weeks. numbers are nice to use in songs. but most of my songs are not 'about' 1 thing or another yes, although line breaks don't show up when it's posted. but when i answer each question seperately, there will be line breaks there regardless of whether you put them there which games and challenges infinity might cause glitches in finite mathematics quantity is nice if the quality is also good quality + quantity"

I understand this question page is your survival strategy but as a humble observer from afar, it looks like this page is bringing more negativity than you deserve. You don't owe us anything, and if you need to take a break from answering questions and focus on your art, it would be more than reasonable.

It has no clear definition, and yet it still exists, people make it and people listen to it and buy it. There's lots of different ways people have defined music.. some have given really simplified answers. Edgard Varese has one of the most famous definitions of music as being \"organized sound.\" Frank Zappa said \"a composer is a guy who goes around forcing his will on unsuspecting air molecules, often with the assistance of unsuspecting musicians.\" Barney Childs' definition is that \"A piece of music is simply a chunk of time you are paying attention to with your ears.\" Others have given definitions that are more abstract, like Beethoven (\"Music is the one incorporeal entrance into the higher world of knowledge which comprehends mankind but which mankind cannot comprehend\"). You said \"the onl y way i really know of to define it is by making some of it, or finding some of it to listen to. then you can go, \"ah, that's music. i think\"\" .... But if music is in the eye (or ear) of the beholder... where does that leave the composer/creator/performer?

        "question": "whats your song-picking system?",
        "answer": "i'm randomizing from a long list of songs which includes songs where the writing is finished and where writing is not finished. whichever one i pick, i have to finish the writing, and record it. this is a system i started to use last year except this year i have added an extra twist which is that i tell myself that i technically don't have to release it, but i do have to finish it and record it. this is very important because it prevents me from getting cold feet about the selection, and helps me carry on and record it and not 'blame the selection.' this creates somewhat of a paradox because if i follow through on the recording, i'm gonna find a way to make it good, and will end up posting it in the end. but for some reason it really helps to at least pretend thst i'm not required to release it. this enables me to freely experiment on trying to make the best of what might seem like a weak selection. for example, when 'california' came up, my first reaction was 'oh no, not another weed song. people are gonna think all my songs are about weed' and i probably would have chickened out on the selection and then the entire credibility of the random system would collapse. but if i'm allowed to just 'try' recording it to see if i can make it good, it removes the pressure. and allows me to try making it the best i can make it, without stressing that it's the wrong selection. like i said, this strategy is a huge paradox in many ways but it seems to work"

        "question": "COuld you explain tritone substitution?",
        "answer": "if you listen to this clip you might think you are just hearing a 2-5 in the key of C. you might think the bass is playing D, G (and to C next of course). it could be, and that would work normally. but if you listen closely the bass is actually playing D, Db (and to C next). in a 2-5, the G dominant 7th chord contains the notes B and F (a tritone). i guess some wise guy discovered that you can actually put Db in the bass instead of G, it still works. the tritone in the right hand (B and F) is the same in G7 as it is in Db7. what's more is, if you had a 13 in the G7 (E) so your right hand notes were F,B,E, that still works over Db, it becomes something like Db7#9 (F,B,E, same thing). that is actually the way it happens on the clip. another experiment you can do to better understand the situation: play 7th chords going thru the circle of 5ths: for example E7, A7, D7, G7, C7, F7, etc etc etc and don't include the 5th or the root in your right hand. so for E7, just play E in the bass and G# and D (which is all you really need to make it a 7th chord). and for A7 play just A in the bass and G and C# in the right hand, etc. and move through the 7th chords in this order. you will notice that the bass is moving thru the circle of fifths, but the tritone harmony in your right hand is actually just descending chromatically. nifty huh. so effectively, if you have 7th chords moving through the circle of 5ths like this, really if the bass player is feeling clever they can just move chromatically down. i hope that makes sense"

        "question": "I found it kind of funny that you were like, \"Oh, no, not another weed song\" when in california was selected. I had the same thought when I heard it. Nonetheless, it is a great song. But that's beside the point. You've previously touched on the idea that you have different \"periods\" in your songwriting. For instance, you mentioned that songs written in spring/summer of 2009 like new canaan have a \"traveling feeling.\" Since we probably won't hear a song that you have recently written for a while (unless the randomizer picks it), do you have an idea of what characterizes your current music writing style?",
        "answer": "actually the current song is a hook from late 2015, which i have written the remaining 90% of this week my current writing is sort of a culmination of all the techniques i have ever used"

        "answer": "i am aiming for every tuesday. 'i love you' was lucky because the instrumental sequence was actually already recorded in early 2015, i just had to do the vocals. also it was relatively short. the next song, for example, was only 10% written and it is full length so i have to write the whole thing, AND record it. not entirely sure that is possible in one week but i will try."

        "answer": "basically you can't just upload your music to spotify. you have to pay somebody 'more important' who has the privilege to do it. some of these services charge a fee for every song, which would never work for me, because i plan on releasing a lot of songs. i found a service lets you do it unlimited for a yearly fee, and they deliver the song within a couple days (sometimes next day) to itunes and spotify. but unfortunately they refuse to send any songs that are less than 1 minute. so i actually had to sign up for a second service which allows short songs, but they take about 4 weeks to send it. so i am paying 2 different companies to upload my songs for me, depending on whether they are less or more than a minute. also, when it comes to putting my umbrella icon on my channel, i have mostly given up on that. they only take images from a database called \"Rovi,\" and i have submitted my image to the database, but it never seems to go through. i read somewhere that Rovi basically only accepts who they want, and there's nothing i can do"

        "answer": "it's an instrument randomization system i came up with in 2015. the trick is, you pick a random instrument, and then you are responsible for finding where in the song it fits, and what to do on it. for example, you might pick something that seems all wrong for the song, and you might say \"oh no, that's all wrong for this song.\" but if you start searching through the song, bar by bar, you will find just the right spot to put it. and then when listening to it, it sounds like a really fresh choice, and it fits the spot because you found where it fits, but the listener might think you went and found the instrument based on what would fit in that spot, but you actually picked the instrument first and then found the spot. life hack. turns out this is the only way i can get anything done now"

        "question": "when was movie star written? what was the inspiration?",
        "answer": "it was originally from a vine writing session, in december 2015, but it was shelved for later because i thought it would be better as a longer song instead of a vine. it was just the title/hook. the entire remainder of the song was written last week"

        "answer": "it was written on a vine writing session, which also yielded 'made some bread in my head,' 'i hate myself,' 'clean my room', etc. they don't really mean anything. just trying to make nice hooks. actually i was really trying to work on history of japan, but i was desperately trying to maintain my vine channel at the same time because that was where my strongest following was at the time"

'movie star' was one of those. the purpose of the session was to generate more material for vines. the 2 projects i was doing at the time were history of japan and maintaining daily vine uploads. i hope that makes sense"

        "question": "I think it's a good thing to learn as much music theory as possible, because learning theory will give you different \"tools\" that you can chose to use (or not use) at your disposal. But one thing I've noticed with these theory-nerds (myself included) is that they'll over think things. Sometimes a simple ii-V-I sounds better than a tritone substitution. Sometimes a triad (or a two part harmony, or even a single note) works better than a fancy extended chord. I think I'm a much better player after years of studying and learning, but when I was first learning music I'd write songs much faster and more easily than I do now...

        "question": "i understand that you don't want searching for better and better sounds all the time to get in your way of just writing and recording, but don't you want to transcend a lot of cultural elements that have no distinct purpose to you that you were born into? like approximating the way notes fit together in harmony by using the equal temperament tuning? i dont mean like retune your keyboards, but when talking about microtonal music, i usually tend to think of tuning chords to the harmonic series, rather than the piano. i just hope you actively do that when you can instead of using an easier way all the time to get more content finished. after all you do seem like quite the creativity purist. hell im sure you've thought about it tho. nevermind. you don't need to respond to this im just rambling cause i get triggered when you say no to microtonal music. ur right, splitting half notes in half again doesn't really make that much sense",
        "answer": "ah, you are suggesting that i pursue the 'perfect' tuning, instead of using equal temperment tuning. this sounds like a righteous idea, but i have to tell you that i embarked on a viscious mission (in about january 2011 i believe) to get to the bottom of this situation. i set out to get a perfect tuning that at least worked in 1 key. after many hours (days? i don't remember) of experimentation, what i found surprised me. you actually can't do it. even to play within 1 key, you need to compromise. let me see if i can explain it: start by tuning a C chord properly (so that the E is a true harmony with C, and the G is a true 5th from C.) So let's get our F, that's gonna be a true 5th down from C, right? now A should be a pure major third above F, for sure. and B should surely be a pure major 3rd above G. now what should D be? you would assume that it would be a pure ninth from C (i.e. the frequency times 9 and then divided back down the octaves) which is good for the G chord also because it will be a 5th away from G. looks great, so now you've got C, D, E, F, G, A, B. but what you find next might come as a shock. D minor sounds like a nightmare. because D to A is supposed to be a 5th and now it is a very very wrong 5th. because you tuned your A to be a harmonically pure major 3rd away from F. no matter how you slice it, you inevitably run into the same argument where a 3rd needs to be a purely harmonic 3rd, but also needs to be a series of 5ths. i juggled the possibilities all around for at least a day, and i was completely stunned to find out that the essence of music, and specifically the way the \"secondary\" notes (let's say in a major key, the secondary notes are D, F, A, and also G, and the primary notes are C,E,G. that's right, G is both, the universe is a love paradox, get used to it) the secondary notes need equal tempered tuning to work right. there are surely many different ways to look at this and i made up the primary and secondary classifications for this example, but the point is that there will always be overlap. you will never have 2 exclusive sets of notes. it stems from the fact that the D note needs to be able to relate to G, but also needs to relate to the A, but the A also needs to relate to the F, and the F also definitely needs to relate to the C. now you might say \"ok, tune them differently depending on what chords you're using.\" but that really doesn't work right, because music needs all these notes to coexist. you're not going to just expect that Dmin and Fmaj will never need to blend together with the A held over. or that Dmin and Gmaj will never need to blend together with the D held over. At the end of this mind exploding journey, i basically found that it seems to be summed up perfectly in 2 chords. Cmaj, and like any combination of D,F,A, and G perhaps with G in the bass. in that 'secondary' chord, all in one moment, (which is the 'less' stable of the 2 chords when they are used in a musical context) that chord encapsulates the dual nature of the way these harmonies are working. is the F in that chord supposed to relate mainly to the C? or is it supposed to relate to the D in a pure minor third? and similarly, is the D supposed to relate to the G? the answer is, all 3 of these relationships are supposed to hold together. but this is mathematically impossible to happen exactly. so the entire essence of that Dmin, or 5dom7(sus if you like?) whatever, 'secondary' chord, the entire essence of that chord is that it contains different relationships that have to all sound like they work and yet they could never all 3 work exactly. the chord needs compromise in order to work. perhaps that is why it feels like the secondary chord or the 'less stable' or the 'i'm just waiting to go back to C' chord. realizing this changed me, because i was always told that equal tempered tuning was mainly used as a compromise to play in all 12 keys. but what i realized is you actually need it just to play in 1 key. like, just to play a 1 and a 2min. just to play the most basic essence of a key and have it work with itself. it really made me appreciate that 'secondary' chord (Dmin, G, etc) the D to F and the D to G relationship on kind of an earth shattering spiritual level, it's like the damn thing has heartbreak built right in. what you think you are hearing is the d to f relationship and the d to g relationship and the f to c relationthip, etc, all at the same time, when really it could never be, at least not exactly. but it is close enough to feel it. basically ever since this experiment i have had a wildly new appreciation for how and why music works, on an even more 'human' level than i expected. and i never questioned equal tempered tuning again"

        "question": "have you considered combining some of the song ideas on your list to get through it more effectively? i mean, if they were deemed worthy to write down for posterity, they're certainly already good ideas and concepts, and putting these ideas together might also streamline the writing process a bit",
        "answer": "in my experience, combining songs is not a good strategy. each song has its own very unique needs and it is important to consider exactly what that song needs in order to make it the strongest song. combining 2 halfwritten songs would be kind of like combining 2 half built houses and hoping it makes sense. although i suppose it may work for some people, and i think that's great. the last time i revealed here that i don't combine songs someone got mad at me. so it is important to emphasize the fact that other people may have success in doing that but it is not something that i think makes sense for me"

        "answer": "you can probably get pads that use a kick pedal, and you'll also need some regular drum pads, and then get like 3 or 4 snare stands, make sure they can go up high (so you can simulate the position of a high hat) and get a drum throne. and sticks which you surely already have. or if you've got a lot more money, you could get an electronic drum kit. you already have stick technique, but getting a kick pedal and some way to play a pad with it will be helpful because learning to use a kick pedal is it's own thing, just like learning to use the sticks"

Do you think there is a way that pop music will ever return to a genre with such complexity in regards to key changes? I know jazz tries but do you think it's possible that a completely different genre of music could come about and achieve this task? Furthermore, do you think it's actually possible, with your knowledge in music theory, that such a blending of genres is yet to be found which could make the complex palatable in a way that the general population would accept it? If so, can you predict which direction/genre/ noun of music it will come from?",
        "answer": "i disagree key changes can be a useful and powerful tool. there are other tools as well jazz can mean many different things but it originally meant pop. harmonic complexity may or may not exist there, or anywhere key changes and harmonic complexity can be a very powerful tool. it is one of many tools. if you notice that a certain powerful tool is not being used to its full potential, you can start using it and you might have a huge advantage. i'm not sure if that answers your question anyone can make music, and so can you. i'm not sure if that answers your question"

        "answer": "that's not quite how it went. instead of suddenly 'stopping' after history of japan, i suddenly Started after history of japan. the reality page never existed before that. after releasing history of japan i thought it would be a good chance to do what i've wanted to do for years, which is actually go through those thousands of hours of journals and edit them into something watchable, that shows what my life is like. it took about 3 months of solid work (feb-may, 2016) to collect and edit all those clips and make videos out of them. all other projects were put on hold in order to do those reality videos. everyone thought i was dead. finally i rushed through the last 2 years of the project and skipped out on huge sections of time, just to finish it around may 2016, and finally move on to more exciting newer content. by that time, there were also 3 new months of journals, mostly talking about editing journals of course. but i decided to save that for the next update, whenever i get a chance to put my career on hold again for 3 months. which is ironically what everyone thinks i'm always doing, because i can't make everyone's favorite type of content at the same time. for example, now i am doing songs every week. which is great news for all the people who wanted me to do songs while i was trying to do the reality videos. but unfortunately it is bad news for you. either way it is bad news for me, because i want all of it to be done immediately. i hope that makes sense"

        "question": "6.20.17 7:03 pm you answered \"i'm not sure what you mean\". this is your usual answer whenever someone refers to your music as \"joke\" music. i don't think anyone thinks it in the negative sense, but your music certainly exudes a humorous, joking feel. you can't be serious when you say that you don't understand that, right? comparing art is usually pointless, but for example, would you not say that Radiohead's music (for example) has a lot more serious tone and message compared to your music? with lyrics like \"i'm a movie star\" you can't expect people to not think that you're aiming for humor. all that said, your stuff is great, i just wanted to ask you why you refuse to accept your musical style with specific wording and just evade all attempts at classification",
        "answer": "i am very serious about creating something that is enjoyable and meaningful to watch or listen to. if we have to call everything either a \"joke\" or \"serious\" then this would seriously be no fun, and also not meaningful. if movie star is a joke then i guess i don't get what the joke is. although the song does use fiction. many songs use fiction/metaphors etc, such as 'i am the walrus' etc"

Even with well intentioned questions that say something like 'hey, I think you may be overworking, so remember to take care of yourself' you respond to in a very prickly way. I can never know what you go through, and I have no doubt it must be endlessly frustrating, but perhaps it's time to try to pay less attention to people being pushy (if you haven't). You probably also need to realise like some people (e.g. the example above) are only inquiring in good faith, and you should try not to take your frustrations out on them.",
        "answer": "normally i'm fine but every once in a while i snap after being pulled in every direction 100s of times. can you imagine, in addition to people always thinking i'm neglecting everything, some people think i work too fast, and wonder why i work so hard. your question included, because you probably don't realize the quantity of contradictary requests, demands etc, which i regularly ignore in a calm fashion"

        "answer": "i think it's great. i've probably never heard past the first couple minutes. paul has a habbit of sending a 2 minute song around in circles when it might not need to. one thing i find particularly valuable is the elongated hang at the end of the chorus. he hits a Fmaj7 chord (somg is in Bb) in the midst of that which is a super neat twist on what otherwise might be accomplished using C7. also what i think is valuable about that song is that the verse gets away with making nothing sound like something. the doorbell's ringing, get the door! that's all!!! not even any rhymes in the verse!! that's one thing that paul has done many times for me, is remind me that you can get away with Anything as long as you can convince yourself you're having fun"

        "answer": "that relates more to songwriting. i have now figured out a cornucopia of different tricks and methods for songwriting, and no longer feel blocked in that regard most people still don't even think i am making any content. they always think i've 'stopped.' this is because it is impossible to make content instantly, especially if it is anything of a reasonable size. so therefore i need to hustle like crazy just to keep things coming out at a somewhat reasonable rate"

        "question": "i find your goals a bit mysterious. basically, from what you let on here, you want to create as much as possible before you die. just constant creation of your stuff. but, interestingly, you even consider other types of creation to be obstacles in the way of your other creations. so you say things like \"i'd make more of X but then I have to make less of Y\". what are your motives here exactly? you do realize you've already made 10 albums worth of stuff? do you wanna be Zappa? I guess Zappa is good. do you have more mainstream aspirations like releasing albums, touring, interviews? i think it wouldn't be unwise to take some time to try to work on those things. expanding your influence, expanding your experience. doing this and then doing that other thing. your music and work would probably benefit from something like that.",
        "answer": "if you do more of one thing, have to do less of the other things because you are busy making the first thing. it's like if you want to make 10 cakes and 10 pies. you might be able to make 15 cakes instead, but maybe you can only make 5 pies, because you were busy making cakes instead. this rule does not apply if you have infinite time, or if you can somehow pause time. but i have not figured out a way to do that yet unfortunately not really i don't think songs need to be in groups. from what i can tell, it is usually the singles that are mainstream, not the albums i prefer to do questions here everything seems to be going great"
