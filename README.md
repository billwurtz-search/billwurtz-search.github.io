## Why?
Why not? Searching is cool. Searching with Regex is even cooler.

## How does it work?
I scraped the questions page to json files that ARE parsable, instead of the mess that is the original html. The search itself is just Js.

## Will you update the log files?
Occasionally. Just don't yell at me if I don't for a bit.

## Can I use the log files myself?
YES! Go for it. Actually, I would love to see someone analyzing it.

## About pull requests
Sure. If you make a fix or like add a feature, send it to me.

## Contact
I don't know. Just DM my [Reddit account](https://reddit.com/user/Kuzeyy27). I don't go on Reddit a lot, but this felt "safer" than putting my email on the internet.
Also, if you have actual serious issues with this, please still contact me in the same way. I will take it down.
