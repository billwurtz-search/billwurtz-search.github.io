        "answer": "seems legit. verse of 'don't dream it's over' does that. chorus of 'sk8er boi' also does it. and many more examples i can't think of right now"

        "question": "hey Bill,have you got a name for that classic soul progression that goes VI-V-Im-VIIm-III-VI-V -Im? Like \"just the two of us\" or \"if you want me to stay\" (but in this case already beggining in the root), and have you ever heard any nice twists to it? Keep up the good work! Love you",
        "answer": "i don't have a name for it, other than to say it's the good old \"5min to set up the 4\" except it's used from the perspective of the relative minor. so like, if you're in a minor key, it's when you go ahead and smack the flat7min7, to set up the b6. honestly, a pretty slick version of this which you might get a kick out of, is in the verse of 'let me love you one more time' (benson). and then there's obviously biggie's 'big poppa' which i believe is actually just isley brothers. also check out the second verse of a song called \"You\" by mya, on the word \"grow.\" this one has the extra passing tone thrown in for bonus points. Also, another twist i just thought of -- a lot of songs do like a 2-5 and then another 2-5 a whole step lower -- so it actually kind of has that same effect when it hits the 2 of the second 2-5-- sounds like the b7min7. example of that would be c'est la vie by robbie neville. 'love' by musiq does another one chromatically in the verse, but the melody doesn't obey it as well as the 'mya' example. here's one that may seem subtle -- there was a mariah carey song (maybe 2006??) called 'shake it off\" it's really just 3 chord hits, but it implies the same thing. t-pain 'show you how' also uses it pretty quick. also 'luv' by janet jackson uses it very expertly, with a gold-plated tritone substitution thing for the inbetween chord. basically all these are the b7min7 (to usually set up the b6) from a minor key. hope that's what you meant, i'm just taking that as the main common thread between your examples. ultimately this is a good technique, which i bet not many people know nowadays, and it is surely a great way to get chicks"

        "answer": "i used to worry about different fonts for everything, but that became not only a waste of time, but also distracting from a viewing standpoint. i ultimately made a decision to actually use the default font for everything. it gave me a lot of creative clarity, and greater efficiency. i learned it's better to focus on your strong points, and don't worry about things that are not your strong points. i don't make my own fonts, and i don't have access to a large font libary, so this would not be a strong point. by religiously using the default font only, i found that i could instantly put all my focus on things that are my strong points -- positioning, angles, motion, and timing."

Then again, you'd probably have to make an individual page for each one, which would be time consuming. But then i guess you could just link directly to youtube. idk where i was going with this",
        "answer": "i think they would run slower if i did that. also it is extremely important that it runs without glitches once it loads, and also to be able to have quick access to any point in the video, easy pause/unpause, etc. all those things are made extremely difficult on youtube. also, easy downloadability is something i value above all else. the ultimate viewing experience is watching it on your hard drive, in my opinion. that's why it is extremely important to me to provide that experience for people. that's what this site is for- i'm giving you all this content. for those who prefer the youtube experience, they can watch on youtube. and for the shorter ones i would recommend vine"

        "answer": "i was in starbucks at 18th av and 65th st in brooklyn, and a bob marley song was playing. i was reminded of people living poverty longing for a better world, and expressing that through music. even though i wasn't living in a 3rd world country, i was still feeling sad from the general disconnectedness of people on earth, and worn down from the general sadness that everyone lives in separate houses and strangers dont talk to each other. as i was walking down the sidewalk i came up with the chorus, and probably the second verse also"

        "question": "ok i've got first verse, chorus, second verse, second chorus. now what?",
        "answer": "take a deep breath, and run through the song. the song already has a strong identity. ask the song what it needs, if anything. to do this right, you need to keep cleaering your head and running the song from the beginning, and right as you are getting to the end of the second chorus, that's when you will have the clearest idea of what needs to happen. Remember to remain open to all possibilities! including nothing. this part of songwriting is something i call \"finishing\" because there is really no telling what it's going to need. every song is different. i've heard so many songs that in my opinion fail at 'finishing' because they didn't take proper care to figure out what's best for that song. in other words, having a bridge when there shouldn't be a bridge. having the wrong kind of bridge. bridges are unpredictable anyway and this ties in with the 'be open to anything' strategy. this is a very sensitive part of the process, and every song needs something distinctly different, and quite possibly nothing. you will only know clearly after doing a full run through, and start paying attention about halfway through second chorus. many times your next step will be something that almost interrupts the end of the chorus to go to a different thing. other examples of things that work in some songs are: another verse with no lyrics. another chorus with no lyrics. maybe a totally different thing with no lyrics. another chorus with different lyrics. a totally different thing with lyrics. but this is a sensitive issue and every song has very distinctive needs, so you need to make sure you are doing full run throughs and really let the song decide what it needs or doesn't need."

        "answer": "there are many different ways of doing all this, but in my experience, the music picks up a lot of the slack. most great songs look very short on paper (if you just look at the lyrics), and also look very nothing. most times when people write things that are meant to stand on their own without music, and then try to put to music, there is usually way too much content to fit in a song, and often there are many words that look good on paper but just aren't very singable. then again, this can be done many many different ways. the only way i know is to do it all at the same time. i think songwriting might be more similar to writing a script for a movie than poetry."

        "question": "can you reveal, or have you already, which song(s) made no sense that you wrote outside the brooklyn museum?",
        "answer": "let me see if i can explain this clearly... 9.17.10 was the actual writing session, actually sitting outside the brooklyn museum, with a binder (with paper). i was writing really short stupid tunes. the first one was called 'run.' the second one was called 'write me another.' 'write me another' got recorded a month later, along with many others. 'run' never got recorded. much later, in 2013 during a year-long writing sweep, both of those songs came up for evaluation/re-write/delete consideration. 'run' actually got split into 2 songs -- i basically separated the 'run' part and called that its own song (run), and then i took the 'looking glass' part and added a new ending, ('elf') which actually carries on the original narrative and explains more details about the 2010 writing session (fine morning in brooklyn, etc etc). 'write me another' also got a 2013 evaluation (which was unusual for already recorded songs, but for some reason i thought it was worth looking at) and one of the possible endings i was looking at was \"i'm gonna plan my day\"... but that line ended up being its own thing. another option was 'i just wrote a song and it made no sense, i'm here outside the brooklyn museum, etc etc\" and that is the one i ended up going with. so, again, this actually explains more details about the original situation, despite the fact that that part was actually written years later. later still, in 2014, when i was doing 4 videos a week and 1 song every wednesday, the new version of \"just wrote a song (now called brooklyn museum)\" got recorded. so as a result, there are 2 recordings that start with the exact same line (i just wrote a song) one recorded in 2010 and one recorded in 2014. the 'i'm gonna plan my day' bit also got picked for a wednesday during 2014. also, the 'elf' bit got picked. it's important to remember that during 2014, i had to pick short songs way too often, because there just wasn't enough time to do anything of length, and anything short that was any good got picked earlier in the year, so by september (or whenever it was) i was only left with the worst ones (like these ones, or macys, or whatever). basically i'm apologizing for this crap. it was all written way before i knew what i was doing (2010), and through a series of circumstances ended up being recorded, hastily. i hope that makes sense"

        "question": "you used to decide what to work on according to length, then with a randomizer, and it seems now you're trying to pretty evenly distribute music/short stuff/long videos over time. are you using any sort of system now to decide what to work on?",
        "answer": "i am now \"writing the queue\" in a more human way than ever before, and i think that is a breakthrough for me. the short videos (including 'what is love') were all newly written as i made the queue (not selected from the archive). i have added some songs to the queue which i HAVE picked randomly, but I'm doing it differently than before -- now I'm actually randomizing from the entire list of songs including ones that are not 100% done (writing), where as before i would only pick from the completed list, and as a result the ones selected were always very old, because the newer ones are usually unfinished (writing). but now i have actually made a list that includes all the partially written ones (including ones that are just a title, or just one line, or even just an idea.) and whatever gets picked, i have to write it to completion. as a result, the finished items will include more newer and stronger writing. So far 3 song picks have been made, the first one was about 50% done, the second one was 100% done but i changed part of it, and the third one was really just a short (very traditional) chord form with barely a dummy melody, and i finished and wrote the whole thing. The entire current queue of items was made/selected/written between 5/20 and 5/26, and it has 11 items, starting with \"thinkin bout doing some content.\" after those 11 items, there is a history video which is currently only a title. after picking that title, i decided to start production on the videos. The list may change, and i am trying very hard to resist the hammering from the public to \"just do another history video\" and i am trying very hard to remember that no one was asking for a history video before i did it (they wanted vines forever), and that following through in my own way is what made that what it was, and i am trying to remember to continue operating like that."

        "question": "i know you've mentioned a few times here that we shouldn't change for anyone or do anything just because someone else wants us to, but you said that in early 2015 you were showing your face in videos quite often then stopped because people didn't like it. Why is that?",
        "answer": "that actually wasn't the reason i stopped. i actually didn't stop ..... let me see if i can explain this .... on the original 5-day schedule, i was basically in the video once a week. after taking a break, i came back to a 2 day schedule, which specifically had me appearing once a week (only 2 videos per week.) all those videos got uploaded to vine in a condensed period of time (1 video per day) so when videos from the 2 day schedule went up to vine, that would mean i was appearing every 2 days on vine. and still if you look at the youtube stream, it is every other video. those videos were coming out monday and thursday. so it's still once a week. after the vine content horizon, i had to start actually making 7 days a week to maintain the 7 day schedule on vine, and i decided to preserve the monday/thursday formats, and just surround them with jingles. thursday's format shifted to band videos instead of spoken 1-liners, but it was still a chance for me to be in the video. still once a week. throughout the following months, that mostly stayed the same. i may have missed a couple thursdays, and also tried to make up for it. but i continued to appear in them roughly once a week, all the way through the majority of the time working on history of japan, all the way up until the point when i finally quit doing vines in order to finish history of japan. then history of japan came out, and i decided to build a journal page and edit 6 years worth of journals, and also build improv pages and do improv edits. (which by the way, i do appear in some of). so overall i don't think there is a very convincing argument that i stopped. although it is true that during the time when the 2 day schedule was going up to vine, there were people who indicated that they were tired of seeing me every other day. but there was nothing i could do about it, because i was uploading all the videos in order. i do think it is important to appear in videos reasonably often, because i don't want it to be shocking when i do"

        "answer": "many years ago before i really made songs or videos, i spent a lot of time using just text. it was a creative outlet that was very easy and quick. i always figured i would eventually turn some of that material into videos. as other things took over, (songwriting, improvising) i guess i would sometimes forget about the massive amount of text. i think i ultimately decided that the text should stay as text, and just be posted as is. although so far i have posted maybe 2% of it. every few months i go through and find more stuff to add"

(i spent all of 2012 and 2013 writing!) so if i don't figure that out soon, my life will explode. But i also don't want to drop the research/history thing, because it is also very important to me, and i know many many people are also eagerly awaiting it. i am trying to figure out how to not fragment my career. yesterday i actually started writing a research/history video, and i am very confident in where it's going, but i am also gravely aware that if i don't jump seriously into recording songs in large quantities, i may die. that being said, i have a 1 minute song all set with video that will be coming out next week, which might help kick things off. i'm really not sure if i'm going to push full speed ahead with this history video now, or try to push forward with songs, or whatever. reaching this decision is exactly what i will be doing for the next couple days. it is very precarious"

        "question": "Have you already made your full length songs? When will you post them?",
        "answer": "during the last 5, no fuck it, 7 years, i have been writing them in massive, massive quantities. i started recording a few of them in 2009 and continued to reacord many throughout 2010. but i also kept writing even more. then i wrote more. then i recorded a few in 2011, and stlil wrote more. some of them were fragments. in 2012 i started organizing the fragments and writing on all of them, and finishing many of them. i wrote constantly with no recording for the next couple years. in 2014 i started making short videos regularly, and recording a song (picked from the archive) once a week. but the longer ones couldn't really get done that often because i was on such a tight schedule. the success i've had with videos has gotten in the way of having time to do songs. research videos also became important to me, so i had to tackle that. now that that door is at least opened, i think it's time to think about songs. to clarify, every song i've ever recorded has been released (except for maybe 1 or 2 which came out really bad). there are many many many many more written, and many more partially written, and i feel like my songwriting is in a better place now than ever before, after all the practice i got in 2012/13, as well as all the practice i got doing all those jingle vines. i probably over answered your question. Trust me, if i had stuff recorded, i would post it. the defining problem of my life is that i can't record nearly as fast as i can write"

        "question": "So hopefully this question isn't too personal for your tastes - and if it is, I hope you choose to answer it by means other than this page - because honestly, I am baffled by you. You often mention feelings of loneliness, and I wonder if this is actually how you feel, or if it's part of the self-deprecating humour routine. It boggles me, because you seem absolutely content with being alone, and I know that personally, if I had the chance to meet you or even write together, I would grab it immediately. As a girl freshly graduated from college and trying to figure out the path of sharing my ideas with the world, watching what you do is inspiring to me. So thank you for doing what you love, and thank you for giving it out for others to see. :)",
        "answer": "i have mentioned this before, but it was reluctantly that i decided to really start working alone. but ever since i did, it has worked very well and the loneliness is much more tolerable and organized. it doesn't feel 'wrong' like it did before, but it is still there. it is especially strong when i feel up against the wall about lengths of projects -- i want to do longer projects and i think most people want me to, but they take so long that it means nothing gets posted in the mean time. that's kind of when i feel the most lonely-- there's no one that really is with me during that struggle."

        "question": "I'm not really that good at writing music but I like to make it anyway. I've been using GarageBand for instrumentals and Notes for lyrics. I don't think it'll amount to anything and I sometimes wonder if I took music theory classes, which I don't want to take, whether I would get better and whether it would be worth it. Basically what it boils down to is \"do I want to waste my time doing something that will help in the long run but that I really don't want to do and that I don't need or do I want to teach myself and get better agonizingly slowly but have a lot more fun doing it\"",
        "answer": "news flash.... the fact that you \"don't want\" to learn \"music theory\" is a sneak preview that you are not going to learn it if you expect someone else to teach it to you. that's just the nature of \"music theory\" and/or ... the nature of learning in general, i think! you can't just go to the doctor and get a 'shot' of 'music theory' and know it. besides ..... it doesn't really exist!! the way \"music\" \"theory\" (if there is such a thing) works is .... it's really just how you choose to make sense of the musical world you live in. Every \"music theory\" class really is just an extrapolation of what seems to be the principles among a CERTAIN SET of music that was popular during a certain time period. If you go to a classical school, they will teach you things that relate to what was popular in europe several centuries ago. if you go to berklee, they will probably teach you a lot about what was popular in the 1940s. there could be a class based on only the last 20 years of music, and it would be different still. there is really only a small amount of stuff that is really actually established and unchanging. like note names -- europe named the notes with letters a few centuries ago, and it really stuck. the entire world uses those notes. do you know them? (A, Bb, B, C, etc) i've known many many musicians in my life, and also many people who were in music school, and anyone who really gets how music works did not learn it from a class. they may have been in a class, but what is really going to give you the knowledge is going to come from you. and it will need to happen in your own way. in other words, i have absolutely never met anyone that had music theory entirely 'bestowed' or given to them from only an outside source. i've said this many times, but really the best way to go about it is from the context of music you know and like. Learn that music! learn how to play it. learn how to play those melodies. learn how to play those chords. (and don't expect a chord to always have 3 notes or always be next to each other!) Learn the music you already know. you Will find principles, and you will get to know them very well. THEN, later on, perhaps you will stumble upon a music textbook or something, and 'take a glance' inside, ... and you will probably start to find things that you are familiar with, and maybe you will learn a name or 2. But really that's just learning the names of something you already knew. That won't actually make you 'better,' it only helps in the sense that it helps you communicate with other musicians in a working situation. But that only goes so far, because the majority of musicians (including professionals) really don't know 'official music theory' that deeply, regardless of how experienced they may be. Again, there really is no 'official music theory' beyond a couple very small things -- note names ... and key signatures i guess. Everything else will be stylistically catered to the way music might have been played at a certain time in history. so that is why you are best off approaching it from exactly the standpoint that you are used to. i hope that answers your question"

        "question": "when do you think your next history video will be done?",
        "answer": "i am about 30 to 45 seconds into the writing. i really like the direction that it is going. i am using the same strategy as i did for history of japan, which is \"say as much as you need to say to sufficiently explain the topic FAST and efficiently, but make it as long as you need.\" when the writing is done, i will do a timed read through and then i will know how long it is. i am guessing it will be anywhere between 5 and 10 minutes. (if i can say everything i want to say in 3, that would be fine too. if it takes 15, ...... i guess that's fine too.) japan clocked in at exactly 9 minutes on the first timed run through. i am also working on this video every day, every available hour (just like the last one.) The main difference between this time and last time is this: during the 14 weeks that it took to make history of japan, i was also writing and creating short videos for vine Every Single Day for about the first 2/3 of the time i was working on history of japan. so that would be maybe about half the work time each day devoted to vine, and NOT the history video. Now i am not doing that. so that would be a significant reason why this video might get done faster. Also, after making history of japan, i have refined some of my techniques a bit more, and might be able to work faster. However, the scope of this topic is a bit different, which might present some unforseen challenges. There is also a small chance that I may decide to make a short video just to have Something to release during the long haul (although i might NOT do that, because that will only directly delay the release of the long video.) The good news is, i have a 1 minute song and music video already completed which i am waiting to upload. i am saving it for when i am deep in the depths of production on this long video, so i have something to release. i hope that answers your question"

        "question": "What's the history of \"i can play\"? (I can't get this song out of my head.)",
        "answer": "it was originally written in 2 different 2010 library sessions. here is the chart for the original version. as you can see there are 2 dates on the top, i think the split point is somewhere at the end of the second chorus, that's where i stopped and picked up again in the second session. that was in 2010, and it looks like all the lyrics and sections and pretty much the whole song was there. in 2013, i looked at it again, and made an update. here is the 2013 update it looks like it was transposed, and the chords are clarified and slightly adjusted throughout. but the biggest change is the second chorus -- looks like the second chorus was totally re-written, and now goes on a harmonic adventure through key changes. and the end vamp is re-worked. the song was recorded in 2014 for a wednesday song release, and these charts are obeyed almost exactly. on a tight weekly/daily schedule, as with most of the releases in 2014, any song over 30 seconds is under severe time constraints in the production process, so as a result this recording is very hasty, and i hardly had time to mix the vocal at all, so some of the lines are too loud, and the whole thing is pretty hasty"

        "question": "From bo's ama \"In getting an audience early, I realized how incredibly fluky and volatile people\u0150s attention was. And that trying to control it directly was impossible. The only thing I ever have had control of was the actual work. And for me, the corny truth at the center of it is that you should try to follow your impulse to GIVE something to people, not the impulse to get something from them. I try to tell myself to just shut the fuck up and work hard on something that I think is good and important and make it as good as I can and when I\u0150m done with it, share it. Self-promotion should be the last step, not the first. But also I got super lucky and didn\u0150t have to promote myself so I\u0150m a bit of a privileged hypocrite \u0110 but like that self-branding shit is pretty gross and I just think like makes you feel icky and unsatisfied and I don\u0150t think leads to happiness even when it works.\"",

Mixing issues, mostly: bass too loud, sibilance, etc etc. To relieve stress, more songwriting takes place, and at the same time, no new recording takes places because it feels \"wrong\" to move on until those old recordings are \"OK\". Somtimes, I get on a roll of \"just doing it\" (like what u said about demon-killing songs), and it feels so, so great! The experience stacks up, and slowly things start feeling smoother, it flows. But at some point I will always look back at the first recordings and think, \"that was a good song, but it's recorded terribly. Maybe I should go back...\" and that halts the whole flow. I guess there's no real answer to this situation, but I'm wondering if, besides the demon-killing, did you set yourself any \"limits\" too? Like, \"once a song is recorded, that's it\"?

        "answer": "Everything is different when you increase the length of the project. even things you wouldn't expect to be different. and going from 7 seconds to 9 minutes is a huge difference. i already noticed how different things were when i made some 2 and 3 minute music videos earlier that year. every possible element of the project becomes very different, and new challenges are raised. one unexpected example is, processing power. when i was doing history of japan, by about 3 minutes in, the computer slowed down to the point where i couldn't do anything. and there were actually glitches starting to occur on the render!! so ultimately what i had to do was split the project up into chapters, no longer than about 1 minute. and very carefully allign them so that i could seamlessly export one and import it into the next sequence. i did the same thing when doing score. this is just one example of the many things that are unexpectedly different when the project size changes"

        "answer": "more of a writing experiment. written in early 2012. hadn't written anything in a long time, and 2011 was more about chasing 'normal' writing techniques, and writing using text and recorders, using verse-chorus form, etc... But at this point i was getting restless and missed the days when i used to write songs on paper, beginning to end, in the library. (string-writing, or chain-writing ... train-writing .. whatever you want to call it). So i just hit the page, and 'the road' came out. i just went wherever i wanted to go, and the whole thing stays about equal melodic and harmonic density, yet without any real repeating patterns of any kind. changes keys all over the place. a fun time to get really frisky with key changes. might be inspired by some of the crazier donald fagan writing. the lyrics just came out automatically. everything changes after the \"now i know\" part .... and i'm not sure exactly what that means. in a song like this about \"searching\" it might seem surprising to eventually \"find\" the thing! but it just happened. and the mood sounds a bit strange after that, especially converging on the last line (which i didn't know was going to be the title until the end) .... almost feels like i'm saying everything's fine and i found my way, but it's obvious listening to the harmonic mood that something's not totally cool."

Original idea is from early 2012. it's a floater, it's been kicking around in the system for a while, and got finished little bits at a time. 10.18.13 looks like i solidified the chord specifics of the \"tags\" (the extra wxyz's, etc) and also started the bridge (up until 'i'm alive'). then last month when i was trying to find a path back into songs (and start actually choosing songs for once instead of randomizing them) this one was the only sensible starting point. and i finished the bridge and just settled for basic \"AABA\" form, and figured if anyone complains there's no jokes, oh well. The video making went surprisingly fast. was able to really just screenshot the letters and import them fast and just start messing with them without having a plan. looking forward to being that bold in the future"

Surely the primary links at the end of your vid should be your site and Patreon, no? PLEASE excuse me if I come across as rude. I don't mean to be.",
        "answer": "well, i prefer to just post songs on simple websites to download, like a reasonable person. but for some reason most of the world thinks it's reasonable to get their music through either itunes or spotify. (plus, who knows, if my numbers there ever get to the numbers i've had on vine or youtube, that could mean i finally actually get to earn something!) there's like 1000 songs i still need to record, and i've been waiting to really get started on that for a Long Time. it's just like the Research Video Situation before i did a research video, if that makes sense. So if i can launch a bit more of a following on itunes/spotif, that would be great news for the music -- because no one on spotify is ever going to be mad that i didn't put out a history video on spotify."

        "question": "Hey Bill, love your music. I wanted to ask, do you generally prefer to retain a midi/synth-centric sound or is it a matter of necessity at the moment? If you had the resources to use more real instruments would you? Thanks!",
        "answer": "music can be made out of anything. i firmly believe this. i was raised with access to midi, and my mom actually showed me how it works when i was about 10. i didn't pick up any kind of guitar until i was at least 15. i did try recording audio (non-midi) somewhere around that time, but there was no more freedom. i couldn't change and adjust parts with anywhere near the same freedom that i could with midi. Sure, you can make great and crazy sounds with audio, but i am not a soundsmith. my strength is in the notes, chords, and thankfully i have now found a way to put words into the mix as well. Recording using audio would be an entirely different animal. an entirely different world. a great world, but completely, completely different. it's about as likely for me to suddenly switch to that as it is for me to suddenly become a professional golfer. also, i think this midi approach has a lot of advantages if you have to work alone. i can fly around between different instruments and make adjustments very quickly, which cushions the damage of the 'alone problem' -- the problem where the first instrument can't hear the later instruments being played and can't react to them. Sure, in audio you can do 'punches' but it still seems limited, and it's just a whole diffent game, plus you probably also need more processing power and i have zero life experience working that way, or thinking that way. i've been doing midi since i was 10. for my situation, the advantages of using midi are insane. The only instrument i use audio for is the vocal, because you have to. and that's more than enough to manage. also with recording audio, you have to actually worry about sound quality, mic quality, all kinds of stuff. and these are things that i have Never worried about. I have been made to feel guilty on multiple occasions for using MIDI, and i used to feel guilty about it then, but then i realized that i have heard plenty of artists use MIDI in amazing ways, so at a certain point i really started to embrace it and never looked back. the thing that i probably envy most in the audio world is stuff like strumming guitars, etc. I do think it is eventually worth it to try to conquer the audio mountain in order to include some of those things, but it would be a huge huge change, and require me to learn to think and function in entirely new ways. also you would now have to worry about guitar quality!! worry about the strings, worry about intonation, worry about amps maybe, worry about miking, on and on, more and more issues that i have never even touched. not to mention another even bigger issue: working with other people. using audio would require me to go back to the stone age in many, many, many ways. and i would do it immediately if i could live forever. perhaps i would also become a molecular biologist"

Also, when you chase rhymes, that implies that all your lines will be in sets of 2 that are all the same length. that's just not the way it has to work. Really just open your mind up and take it moment by moment. ask yourself what could you do at each moment that would excite You? you would be surprised how often rhymes show up automatically. but another important thing to remember about \"rhymes\" in music, --- it really doesn't matter if the consonants rhyme. it really just matters if the vowel rhymes. in music, \"fine\" and \"time\" rhyme. no one will ever complain about that. i like to stretch it even more, and sometimes it is actually enjoyable when you break the rhyme. but i will say this again, ...... do not chase the rhyme. the rhymes will always come to you if the time is right. also i should probably mention that i only write lyrics together with the melody. if you are writing only lyrics without a melody, i can understand why you might think you need to search for rhymes. but if put it to a melody, what you will find that the rhymes will want to be in all different places, and the rhymes that you had on paper pre-melody will no longer work. Really what i'm trying to say is, there is absolutely no rules, remain open, and have fun. and never chase rhymes, you will find them coming to you when the time is right"

Every word I say is true.",
        "answer": "pretty good, but there are a few mistakes, some more important than others. the sus2's you have at the beginning of the verses are not really strictly obeyed. that's just kind of the way i played it. i would honestly just think \"Eb\" or \"Ab.\" 2's will sneak in, that would be a players choice. and surely there will be times where you can catch me playing 2's and 3's at the same time. but that's not too important. The next thing i see is at the end of the first stanza, after \"never coming back\" -- the Ebsus4's you have written -- it should include a 2 also. however you choose to say that (Ebsus2,4?? sus4,2??who knows). the first mistake that actually matters is the Bb7 on connecticut. it's Bb7sus4. actually there's a C note in there too. but NO D. i can firmly say in this song you will not hear Ab and D notes played at the same time. when i use D in the chord, it's just a Bb triad (as you have correctly noted, mostly). so that's a Bb7sus4 or Bb9sus4. (or Fmin7 over Bb if that's not too confusing) ok moving on, the pickup notes on \"oh, i'm\" i would definitely specify the bass notes there -- Ab/C, Bb/D. immediately after that, you said Gm on \"canaan\", and it's absolutely not Gm, it's Eb/G. on \"have a good time\" again, it's Bb7sus4 not Bb or Bbsus2. also for what it's worth, the Ab in that line was played as an \"add-2\" but that is not important, that's just player's choice. and again, the oscilating chords in the vamp after \"good time\" includes 2 AND 4. ok, looks good through the train verse, again the 'sus2's are optional and could go either way. \"Turn\" i see you had a question mark. in most of your question mark situations, the magic note here is B. in this case, it is Bb7sus4b9. so again, i stress the fact that there is no D. but there is a B. call it Abmin6 over Bb, call it Bb7sus4b9, whatever. the magic note is B, and there's no D. and there is a Bb (it's in the melody!) Chorus looks good, just triads, Good job recognizing the Cmin7 (and not Eb) on \"blue\"!! i always get paranoid that people might not \"feel\" the 6 bass in those situations when there is no bass. i am glad it came across. on 'You', the sus4 and major really blend together. if i was playing guitar in the key of E, i would be playing B and letting that high E string ring and blend together. but, close enough. on \"feel, for, you\" i have to nitpick. that is Ab, then Eb/G, then Fmin7. beat by beat. at no point is there Ab/G. last chord before the \"countryside\" verse, is again Bb7sus4b9. the passing chord after \"i can find\" -- here's how that works -- the bass is playing A. another important note in the chord is B. the way to really execute this properly is to include G, B, and Eb in the chord, and the bass plays A. call it Gaug over A, call it A9b5, call it Ebaug7 over A, whatever (Db note probably wouldn't hurt in there.) but listening to the reality of what happened, it looks like at least one of the keyboards is not adhering to this. you can hear the B note, but it looks like someone is still playing a Bb note on the transition chord. and guess what, it goes by so fast it does not matter. in plenty of \"band\" situations, the bass player might choose to play this passing A, and they keyboard/guitar players might not know or care, and it still sounds just find because it goes by so fast. on \"shade\", again this is Bb7b9sus4 (or again, Abmin6 over Bb. same thing) ok, now clearly you have identified something strange happening here on this chord before the bridge (before \"i'm gonna go to starbucks\"). the first thing i will say is, it is NOT a 4 chord. the 4 chord is where you are going-- this chord would be the equivalent of a Eb7. more specifically, Ebaug7. there is clearly an F note in there too. you might even call it Gaug7. there might not be a Db. Again, one of the keyboards is somehow still playing a Bb note, which might be \"illegal\" but it doesn't seem to cause any problems. again, the important note is B, and it's basically just Eb+7. the bass for some reason is allowed to riff freely on Ebmaj pentatonic, not caring about the B nat, because for some reason that's just the way it works. it's a transitionary moment, and you can get away with this. on \"starbucks/ukulele\" i should comment that the Absus4 is just as legal as it would have been in the \"harlem\" part, ... it looks like i used it a little less in the 'starbucks' part, although i do hear one of the strings playing that Db note on \"play my\". on \"Sky\", again, this is Bb7sus4. and right before \"going\" the keys slip in that b9 (B note). on \"going\" with the melody on G, this chord is really happiest emphasizing that G. seems like Abmaj9 with both C and Bb included. on \"feels\", AGAIN it's Bb7sus4b9. and again, the vamp oscilation is Ebsus2 and 4 together. in the last chorus, there are a couple of bass choices that might be worth pointing out in the chords, but you could just blame that on bass player choices. \"dream, of, you\" once again is Ab, then Eb/G, then Fmin7 (not Ab/G). and again, for \"say\", it is Bb7sus4b9. out vamp is correct. near the end, the bass thinks it's doing like a Bdim to Cmin thing, but the keys don't care. so that is probably not even worth writing down. overall, great job"

Also, it is pretty easy to figure out what software i use anyway. that being said, if you have questions that i am not answering, you could try emailing me."

Also, i may have learned a few things from experience after doing the japan video, and might be more efficient. Also, my work schedule is lighter this year, so i have more days and hours available to work. i will keep you updated"

        "question": "Can we get the story behind your song 'do the thing'? I'd really like to hear the thought process behind it, because the lyrics indicate a major change in the singer's behavior. Starting with lines like, \"do the thing\" and \"let me go\" but switching to \"i don't mind\" and \"take your time\" by the end of it.",
        "answer": "this was during a brief period of time when i was actually trying to write in the studio . ... from the beginning of 2011, all i wanted to do was try more \"normal\" songs (maybe with verse / cho? maybe with just some simple looping chord changes?) also potentially written in the studio. (i eventually concluded that this is a terrible idea for me). experiments in this phase include \"when is it time to come home again\" \"how am i sposed\" and \"do the thing\" .... basically in all 3 cases, i sort of set up the chord vamp, and then i had a text file open and very spontaneously, the lyrics+melody materialized out of thin air. very basic lyrics, very basic melodies. i just let it follow the path of least resistance. \"do the thing\" is really like a, 'ok universe, i'm ready to go. please show me the way, take me where i'm supposed to go, i'm ready to see what i need to see now.' ... like a real \"surrenduring to the sky\" type of thing. honestly, after doing so many complex-weird songs with surprises and weird backflips in 2010, i was ready to try the total opposite. so you get this zoned out, almost dead feeling -- for example the huge gap in the lines in the first verse. also, the \"i love you\" song was recorded at the same time, and that also subscribes to this ultra-dead zoned out feel. was trying this out, probably mostly as a reaction to some of the madness that ensued in all the 2010 songs (only about 10% of which ever got recorded, by the way). So that's what you have for the verses of 'do the thing' (and by the way, 'do the thing' is not a good title, i kept changing the title and never really found the right title for that song). for the bridge, i sort of reverted to \"writing mode,\" stopped the session, and turned to the writing keyboard / paper, and wrote a bridge -- vastly diff. key, probably thinking in \"mccartney\" mode. trying to do a really \"special\" bridge. -- by the way, this is also exactly the same strategy for the \"what love is\" bridge -- stop the session, turn to the book and write a bridge. I don't really have a good explaination for why the last verse of \"do the thing\" might feel different, to me it was just common sense to arrive at that place. you can feel a little bit of impatience setting in, like \"i'll wait forever if i have to\" sort of thing. you know, it's that feeling when you are talking to the sky and you know it's the most important conversation ever, but at the same time, ... you might doubt if it even hears you. The tempo decrease makes it seem even more \"dying.\" i was trying new things, again, breaking away from the ultra-complicated, surprise-based writing, and looking to go outside the box on the simple end instead. Go to the store probably goes even further in that direction."

        "question": "When you're writing music (vocal harmonies in particular) do you have the structure mapped out in your head (or on paper) ahead of time before you go about recording each component? Or do you record one track and improvise the harmony over the playback?",
        "answer": "doing vocal harmonies to the extent that i do them now is a new thing for me, and i mainly learned it from doing vines every day. but on long songs it's different, because there's so much more territory to cover, and the tendency is to be lazy (because there are so many more miles of song to cover!) -- so here's a new trick i use that allows me to use more harmonies throughout the song without becoming exhaused-- i build it from the lead, and i just pitch shift it all over the place! that's how i write it. so this would be during the recording process, once i have a vocal (or actually the temp vocal) i just make it from the computer -- this encourages me to try crazy things. one of the first times i did this was on \"free to do whatever you want to\" -- for example, there is one near the end of the bridge (i think on \"can't get over my fear\") ... i never would have thought to do that if i was like, ready to record, quick what should i sing . if i'm sitting around and i can just pitch the lead anywhere, i am free to try really crazy stuff. and in the end, whatever i pick is not that hard to sing. so then i just learn it and sing it, and delete the fake one. and now it sounds just as cool, but it's real! so basically, writing it from the computer lets me try out things really quickly, and be really ambitious. then once i get the part, i just learn it and deliver it. On vines, this really doesn't apply, or also on those dense all-chord jingles in history of japan. Those are all being written note for note when i first write it. and it's become a very sensitive thing. a jingle like \"it's time for world war 1\" i will be sitting at the keyboard meticulously trying different things until the chords are exactly right. And then when i record it, it's pretty simple -- you just sing all the notes of the chords, (taking various other basic considerations). doing vines 7 days a week really accelerated my vocal harmony game, and i'm looking forward to doing much much more of it in the future"

        "answer": "what i have learned is, it IS smart to mix the kick separate. why? because reverb on the kick is usually a bad idea, but you might want a little rev on the rest. so i actually developed a cool technique to quickly separate it out -- i duplicate the channel, and delete all the kicks in one, and delete all the 'everything else' in the other. that's about it. i could separate it more, but life is short. if i'm doing a song with not much reverb, i might not even bother"

There are a few different \"worlds\" of playing piano -- one where you play bass with your left hand, chords with your right hand, and sing the melody. there is another world (like if you are in a band) where the bass player plays the bass, and a singer or horn player plays the melody, and just play chords with whatever hand you want. then there is another world like a jazz trio where the bass player plays the bass and you play chords with your left hand and melody with your right hand. and there is another world where you are by yourself and not singing, so you have somehow play all 3 with 2 hands. depending on which world you are in, you would practice different things"

        "answer": "i never use computer notation programs -- i only do that when i want to use notation in videos. whenever i use notation for writing, i do it on paper, it's much faster. from 2009-2010 i actually wrote everything on paper first, not even using an instrument, i actually did most of it in the library. you can see many of these charts on the site, so you can see the level of detail it includes. it includes exact melody, lyrics, and chords, but not really all the little details of drum parts or aux parts. it will usually have a tempo marking, and sometimes a 'hint' at what the groove should sound like, maybe just referencing another song. but the details of the groove and the little background parts are all worked out during the recording. but the 'road map' (how many bars in each section, how to end it, what the intro is, especially the lengths of things) HAS to be solid before recording. i found that out the hard way. you can't be wondering how it should end when you're recording it. road map has to be set, that's just what i learned. ... Ok, that being said, starting in 2011 i actually learned how to write using a keyboard and voice memo recordings. for a long time i didn't do this because i didn't know how to brainstorm and keep it organized, but i finally figured out how to do it, and wrote like this ever since -- including the massive amount of revisions and updates i made to the existing song catalog during 2012-13. basically there is a master text file, which has a lyric sheet, and every part has a reference audio file that goes with it -- so the text will have the lyric, and then at the end of the stanza or whatever, it would say \"see audio 27.mov\" and that would be just a desk recording of me demoing how it goes, and perhaps giving other instructions or indications of how to deliver it. sometimes even when the song is done, i might do a paste-together of all these demos, or just do a full run through with a click. occasionally i still might use paper, especially if i have a bridge or something that has really interesting changes, but these days i find it's not even worth it -- does not make for easy access, because it would be buried in a book somewhere and i can't 'search' for the file. Before recording a song, i find it very helpful to make a \"studio chart\" which is actually just mainly a chord chart, and it also has specific rhythmic indications of when to play certain chords (particularly when certain chords need to be anticipated)"

        "answer": "i will explain a single page first (the multi-page spread is another issue)... let's say there is just one page of notation, like 8 bars or whatever.... I make the notation in a notation program, and screenshot it. (then i actually make several allignment adjustments in graphics, because notation programs are incredibly finicky, it's easier to adjust things in graphics)... then i save it how i want. then i use graphics to erase the last note (and any chord that goes along with it.) i erase notes on a staff by just dragging empty staff over it. and i \"save as\" and then add a 1 to the file name. repeat, keep erasing the next note and 'save as'. then you have a stack of files all in order. then import. then allign the timing. it's the exact same way i do text, but with text i type it out and screenshot each frame, and delete words (easier, instead of erasing them). the delete technique would not work in a notation program, because the notes and allignment will change as you delete them. that's why i use graphics. it's not that hard, and i'm not even using a graphics program. just an image preview program, and i'm just copying and pasting boxes. the mccartney video was a bit more ambitious because i wanted to do a steady scroll. so i thought it would be good to make one huge image file that is the entire length of the score. and then do the erase per frame technique.... so then all the frames were huge... and then export that to a really high res video and scroll the video??? i don't remember if this was successful, but you run into major problems when you try to do huge things like that. processing power limitations, etc. Same sort of crisis occured when i was trying to do the zoom out on the japanese army. i ended up having to sonehow break the task into smaller pieces. if i recall. i somehow succeeded in gettiing a steady scroll on the notation, only to find out that it was too hard to read when it's moving like that!! so i ended up keeping it still and then sliding forward page by page. if i had known the steady scroll wasn't going to work, i probably would have broken it into pages from the start. i was on a 7 day vine schedule at that time, so that video was an insane time crunch, and the notation took me from about 3am straight through the entire day until 4 pm and was barely on time for work. (not to mention COMPOSING the rhythms and chords, and composing the notation, before animating it.) it was a bad and unhealthy time crunch. i suppose thats what you get for attempting a 30 sec (45 sec? whatever it is) video in place of a 6 second video. was in such a rush, there is a smudge in the youtube version (a stray piece of a note that didn't get erased fully)"

So with free or non-free, and graphics and non-graphics, that makes 4 types of videos. live action free videos were on thursday, and started with 'stand in my room' and just moved forward with anything i could find. a lot of jingles about objects. that's just the way it went. after the break (early 2015) and returning to a 2-day schedule, the live action videos were based on improvised 1-liners, with intro and/or outtro screens to justify."

        "question": "After following your stuff now for a bit, I think I see now that you really just want to make everything that you can possibly make. (A fascinating pursuit, even if it's a bit strange.) What I'm wondering though, is what this means for quality control? So, for instance, would you rather create 100 kind-of okay-ish videos/songs, or 1 really really good one? And if you found one specific thing that meant the world to you, would you be willing to drop everything to work on just that project, or would you rather be working on having more \"things\" done for people to see at the end of the day? (sorry for this question being so wordy, i almost feel bad making you read all this)",
        "answer": "i am trying to do the best stuff i can. but sometimes if you are thinking like that, you won't do anything. at a certain point, you realize that every song or story is only good because there is something wrong with it. the main character has to have a problem in order for the story to mean anything. music has to have something 'bad' or 'wrong' about it, in order for you to feel the healing from that problem. So the more you try to search for the 'perfect' song, you will only realize that the only perfect song is total silence..... which is pointless. Over and over again i have tried to hone in on the \"right music\" and it continues to be impossible, and that is what has always led me to just dig in and start going crazy. in the end, i am a perfectionist, so even if i work on a very strange song or project, i am still going to take care to make sure that it is as good as possible. Also, very important to remember, is that the more you do, the better you get. this is the wheezy waiter \"quantity+quality\" theory. you are really never going to discover what you are truly capable of unless you try many different things. if you sit around and wait for something better and better, you will get no experience and you will chicken out because you will be afraid it won't be good enough. that being said, i am currently working on a video that is longer than any video i have ever made, and it will probably take longer to make than any video i have ever made. so i'm not sure where that fits into your equation of \"100 okay-ish videos\""

        "question": "I used to play guitar but became very bored of playing. Learning songs is boring, playing in front of people has no positive effect (it's like playing normally but making a mistake is more embarassing), and I hate learning about music stuff. I find that playing my own little creations is more interesting than anything else but I do not find learning new things fun. So I don't exactly have any idea of what to do about my guitar situation. I have some skill in playing, but no knowledge or want for knowledge of music. I haven't played for months at this point and have considered playing more but I do not know what to play. So I guess what I'm trying to ask through all of this, is, have you gone through times like this, where you do not like music and don't want to play? And, how long did you take to really figure out what you want to do in music? I have a feeling I am thinking about this with too much structure.",
        "answer": "i have never felt that way about music. that's one of the ways i know it is the right thing for me."

        "question": "Could you give a list of the songs that you primarily wrote using your murder your demon technique?",
        "answer": "hard to define which ones exactly use it .... the idea of starting with junk was an idea i started toying as early as feb 2009 .... 15 minutes (nov 2009) probably uses it. but \"rabbit snakes\" is really the first time i really used it. (12.25.09) i was just so frustrated with not being able to decide what to do in a song, that i was like, ok .... what's the worst thing that could happen if i just say 'rabbit snakes' like this, right at the top? and then the song bloomed into all kinds of interesting things, including obscure dead-beatle conspiracy references. \"dance the\" was written probably on the same day, and absolutely starts with garbage, just the same way. \"eat bread\" also was written at that time, as well as \"trees / everything\" (this one uses major garbage in the second verse.) \"i'm a diamond\" (apr 2010) is a very clear example. starting in august 2010, i started writing a LOT more, and used that a lot. that's when i came up with the name for the concept ('murder your demon') and you get songs like 2010, the summertime, pretty much everything from aug 2010 (also recorded at that time). \"i like.\" \"modern woes\". There are many many many more songs written from 09, 10, .. only a small percentage of them got recorded (it takes much longer to record a song than to write it, and i wrote way too much). in the second half of 2010 i probably wrote more than any other time.... ('dream of evil' came from that time, not sure if that exactly uses 'demon' technique because i don't think any of those parts were specifically deliberately throw-away.) in 2011 i made a big effort to try to write in a more 'normal' way, so there are not any examples from 2011. (well, maybe from early 2011 you have 'skip to my loo'). near the end of 2011 you have 'write a tune that really sucks' that was just a one-off. (also that is an example where instead of going into something non-garbage, it just ends instead. that's an alternate strategy). 2012/13 was all gathering and updating all the existing songs, so not too many new ones got started. but there was one random library session in june 2013 where i wrote several, just like the old days. \"tuesday\" is the main example (and actually kind of a tutorial on how the technique works)"

        "answer": "my original goal was to make it somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes. writing the script now, and it clocks in at about 5:40 and i JUST got to what is supposed to be the \"main topic\" of the video. it's like if you are making a video about fruit, and you are 5 minutes into the video and you just got to the part that talks about the fruit. So that tells me that the total length of the video should probably be at least double what i have so far. If i can get it to work in 10min, that would be great. if it goes up to 15 min and stays engaging and interesting all the way through, i think that would be fine. Japan video was 9, and it took 98 days of solid work to finish it, but i was also doing 6 second vines every day for most of that time, which i am now not doing. also i have probably learned some things from experience and perhaps things will move faster. then again, this video might require many new kinds of graphics tricks. i am working as fast as possible, as always"

        "answer": "really short stuff is a good way to get started if you have wanted to make stuff for years but still haven't put anything out yet. it was a great trick! i was able to start putting stuff out, and i learned a lot. then i got really tired of doing short stuff and scaled it way back to start doing long stuff, but then all of a sudden my vine channel got a lot of attention, so i figured it was a bad time to stop. so i ended up doing even shorter content for ANOTHER 6 months, after i had already felt like i had done enough. it was still fun, and i learned a lot, but i was way overdue for some longer stuff. and then finally i couldn't take it anymore and took a risk and switched to longer stuff. only problem is it takes way longer to make, but i have done way way too much short stuff at this point. there's more than enough out there for people to watch"

But maybe a year after i had been using it and doing videos every day, i found an insane work around. On a mac, there is a help menu, which seems to have access to EVERY menu command, and it is searchable. So if i type \u2318? and then the first 2 (or 3) letters of the menu command, then hit enter, it works. Sure, it's like 8 keystrokes, but once you get fast at it, it is almost as good as having a key-command. Finding a keyboard shortcut for something that doesn't have a keyboard shortcut is a huge victory if you are trying to make content as fast as humanly possible"

        "answer": "this progress report (from during the history of japan process) shows the basic breakdown of the steps. even though that was my first time, the process seems very stable, so I plan on doing it the same way. after the writing is done, i will record a temp vocal (with the right timing) and import it into the timeline. also i will record temp versions of all the jingles, and put them in too. (at that point, i will also have a solid estimate of how long it is). the next phase is \"prelim graphics collection\", which would be finding all the materials i need to download, so in the case of Japan, it would be pictures of emperors and stuff, maps (even if i'm not using the map, i need to find maps that show the proper locations of the things i am mentioning.) A lot of times this means i have to do more research, because if i say \"and then they built a palace, right here\" ... i now have to dig back into the research and really pinpoint where and when that palace is supposed to be, and find the right picture, etc. This phase also can see a few re-writes happening, because i might notice certain parts are not hitting the way i want, or are possibly impossible to explain graphically"

        "answer": "according to the British Royal Crown, you are supposed to capitalize the first letter of every sentence, and also the first word of important things or people, such as the Queen of England, or Harvard University. in my experience, this doesn't really help in communication, and almost hinders it, because you are giving off the impression that you are writing some kind of official document, and possibly not saying what you really mean. The times i prefer to use capitals are in acronyms (like NAFTA, or UNESCO), sometimes at the beginning of sentences if i feel i am changing gear or tone (similar to the way you might use a paragraph break) or also when i want to emphasize one word, i may capitalize the first letter of that word, creating something similar to a bold effect. it is a nice surefire way to emphasize a word even if it is not guaranteed that the 'bold' effect is available, and it is more Mild than the more 'screaming' style of ALL CAPS. then again, when i am trying to convey something of maximum urgency i might possibly use all caps"

        "answer": "you are going to have to comprimise. really stretch the limits of what you can act out yourself. then, of all the elements that you feel you \"can't\" provide yourself, narrow it down to like the most important thing that's missing, and then stretch your available contacts to the limit to find *something* or *someone*. make little comprimises here and there, from re-writes to re-casting, comprimise a little bit everywhere and you will get it done. filmmaking is insane, it requires a small country to do it \"right\" but there's only one path to get there and it's comprimise. even the big league films make comprimises (for example the viewer is not actually in the film)"

        "question": "is it very important to work straight from beginning to end on the new video, or would you consider taking one week to work on a song and music video to release before the long video is done?",
        "answer": "well i was doing that for a little bit, but i got such harsh lectures for \"not doing a history video\" sayind stuff like \"bill, why aren't you doing a history video\" and \"bill, you fucking idiot, why aren't you doing a history video.\" which makes me so angry because i AM doing a history video. there are 2 things i want to do desperately, and that's songs and research videos. I'm not sure where people stand on this issue. i just can't take being accused of not doing something i AM doing, AND it is something i want to do. i want to do them both, so it is very difficult to see where to go here. in a way, i want to start doing songs every week, like NOW, but at the same time i gotta get this history video done. Even people who defend me say \"hey, he only wanted to make history of japan, that was a one-time deal. leave him alone.\" but it's NOT a one-time deal whatsoever. japan was just a test run of a much greater realm of the research format. So either way i am stuck. it's a lot like how i felt stuck between vine and history, before the history video came out, everyone thought i was an 'idiot' and 'irresponsible' for not following through on more vines. it's hard to figure out who is in the majority, and i don't think i should. i saw a content creator try to do a voting system for what the fans thought he should do, and i was honestly very turned off by the idea. i was thinking \"you're the dude, i'm following YOU, ... if you're the leader and you don't know where to go, that's not a very strong sign of leadership.\" so i generally try to stay away from trying to go strictly where the majority would say i should go. besides, if i did that, there's no way i would have taken the risk to do history of japan when i already had a vibrant vine following. so ultimately i have to do what i think is right, and i am extremely torn between songs and big videos at this juncture, but this particular video is turning out to be really large and epic and i think it is exactly what needs to happen right now. and it could easily take a few more months if i work SOLIDLY on it. who knows what may happen if i try to take detours and do songs.... that will make it take even longer, and imagine how much more intense the lectures will get"

        "question": "Dear Sir: I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling US$40,000,000. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company is desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region. You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Nigeria, in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or US$4 million of this amount. However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least US$100,000 in a Nigerian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria. If it will be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that you meet with us in person in Lagos, and that during your visit I introduce you to the representatives of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, as well as with certain officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria. Please call me at your earliest convenience at 18-467-4975. Time is of the essence in this matter; very quickly the Nigerian Government will realize that the Central Bank is maintaining this amount on deposit, and attempt to levy certain depository taxes on it. Yours truly, Prince Alyusi Islassis",

        "question": "how did the video and the song hi it's 1995 came out what was the inspiration for that video",
        "answer": "was written sometime in 2013, i was mostly doing revises and edits for existing songs, i don't know why the 1995 one came to me out of nowhere. being short, it reached 100% completion automatically, so it ended up in the 'completed songs' list which formed itself and then was arranged in order of time length, during 2013. and i started recording shortest-first, so naturally 1995 was one of the first ones. also, during 2013 i was trying to get started doing videos for them, which i was ALSO starting with shortest first. 1995 was sort of a stray, i was almost giving up on shortest first, and i had just finished building the website, and this was right before i spontaneously started the 5-day schedule. the concept for the video seemed straight forward. so i brainstormed a list of all the items - there were probably about 20-25 relevant items i came up with and found images for. and then i spent some time figuring out which ones to put where in the 5x3 grid. interestingly enough, a year later when i edited it for vine, i had room for one more item (vines are square, so it became a 4x4 grid, 16 items instead of 15.) so there is actually 1 additional item that got added to the vine edit"

I can only write music the second way, and I find it very, very difficult to write music notation-first. Did you learn to write music that way in music school, or is that your \"natural\" composing style? Do you think it's worth it for me to force myself to write music on paper before touching the keyboard/guitar as a learning experience?",
        "answer": "do whatever works. for a long time i was unable to do it the 'memo' way ... because how do you figure out which part to start with? how do you figure out when something is final? all kinds of questions, my mind would fall apart. so eventually i just said, 'well, i have to start somewhere' and i figured i was literate enough to just hit the page and start writing. but this results in a very strange kind of writing (think \"modern woes\" or \"rabbit snakes\") where you start with some completely random garbage, and then that part is final. and you have to move on to the next part. so you get this disjointed thing-after-thing format, almost never obeying any repeating form. write however you can. for me it was just a last ditch effort to get something to happen. eventually i finally learned how to organize my world enough to work the other way, and now i have a very solid system of text files and memo files, and everything is catalogued in a way that i know what i'm doing, and i know what i did."

        "question": "i have a specific question, i hope you don't mind answering it. in your world what is your name for this particular chord voicing? starting on D just below middle C and going up D F# G D E? commonly played on guitar. Dadd4add9? D4add9? D24? wtf",
        "answer": "well, it's kind of like you have red and blue at the same time. what you call it depends on what's around it. like if the entire canvas is red, and then some parts of it had blue also, you would call those parts the 'blue parts' and not mention the red. but if the entire canvas was blue and red, then you would call all the parts \"blue and red.\" what i'm trying to say is, that chord is full blown D and Dsus2/4 at the same time. but from a song perspective, it is likely that you may alternate that chord with just regular D. if that is the case, like in the all red (and some blue) painting, you would call it D2/4, because that's the part that has D2/4, and the regular D part doesn't. but if you were playing only entirely that chord (with the 2 and 4 and 1 and 3 together) for the whole time, then you might as well say D add this add that add everything including the kitchen sink. Also the reader will have more time to read it if it's the only chord on a page. but if it is in a song where regular D chords are also used, then i would def. just say D2/4 and it's players choice if u wanna open it all up like that"

        "answer": "well, the first instinct is that it's a standard 5 chord from Fmin, with all the dirty notes -- mainly including the 'dirtiest' note, Gb. so the melody is on top (c, 2 oct above middle C) then right under it you have Ab in the piano, then E under that, and down in the lower octave you have Gb, and then Db (next to middle C). by 'law' it feels like Bb has to be in this chord, and I am almost certain it is. usually Bb likes to go next to middle C, in that range, for these chords. certainly it is C7, b9, b13, b5 (oh also, no one would be playing a G note, i can guarantee that, there is no room for that, they are already playing all the other notes, plus we just came from a G rooted chord). so that is my best assessment. the note that makes this chord sound extra dirty is the Gb. all the other notes are completely standard for c7 in f minor"

        "question": "here's a story. i encountered my friend at the pool. she wasn't holding any children. i was: exactly one child. my friend asked me, who's that? i said, my south-asian child that i birthed. she laughed, and said, no, really. who is it. i said, there's no trick to make me say something else. it's my south-asian child. there are several arts about this story that i would like you to evaluate. [several - 2]. saying something provocative that applies both in character and out of character: this applies to the last item of dialogue. if it is, in fact, my child (or i am ardently trying to project that image) then i am saying, nothing you can say will change the truth. if it is not my child, and i am briefly setting down the notion that it is my child, then i am telling my friend that there is nothing that she can say that will make me break character. isn't that neat? how arty is it, maybe out of 10? [several - 1]. it is clear in this story that there is some armada of reasons that it is unlikely that this is actually my child. the one that is intuitive to me is some race disparity\u0143after all, i said that i, specifically, birthed it. however, the reader is left to decide these reasons for herself. is this ambiguity a good thing in storytelling? out of 10 is fine again but numbers are usually different than ideas, and concepts [several]. what do you think about having a different way to process quotes than the next guy? should i sacrifice ease of reading simply for the purpose of, yes, i am definitely reading a different thing than that other thing. thanx!",
        "answer": "2. i don't understand what you are asking 1. i had no problem accepting that it was the narrator's child, there were no race issues. i simply assumed that the narrator was a south-asian woman. there were certain things about the phrasing that sounded peculiar, but that did not de-rail the logic of the story whatsoever 0. i think it is useful to be clear about where the quotes are, but i actually found it very easy to see where the quotes are in this story, and it really didn't bother me 1. i would like to add that i do think this is a good story, and leaves the reader to wonder what the hell is the point of the entire story, and the fact that the questions seem to make even less than the story (despite appearing so earnestly to make sense) adds to the intrigue"

In modern times, i have found that many players use an octave doubler (with a 4 string) when they need those notes. however, some players choose to use the octave doubler irresponsibly, and they go way below B, resulting in a rumbly mess, and also being punched in the face by me"

The first chorus already sort of had that effect (raised a whole step), and it was a natural continuation of the 'liberating/escape' feeling to have the second chorus be unexpectedly even more adventurous. From that point on, it was just a delicate balance of where i thought it should go next, and i just listened carefully to where it wanted to go from there, and the song was finished very quickly"

        "question": "i guess this might seem really subjective, but let's say you have an instrumental part that is much easier to play a half step higher. is it worth transposing the whole tune a half step up if it's more playable, even if it sounds better in the original key? and have you ever changed the key of an entire song up or down after the song was written?",
        "answer": "well, i use keyboards to record, so theoretically i wouldn't have to actually transpose the sound of the song. but even so, i have no problem playing things in the real key usually. only exception might be if i need a gliss in a different key. to answer your second question, before recording i always do key checks to see what key is comfortable vocally. so many songs are recorded in different keys than they are written"

        "question": "you said \"i really wanna do a band\" and have expressed interest in playing live and possibly touring. can you explain why you want to? or how it would be more fun or fulfilling than what you are doing now?",
        "answer": "wow, isn't it obvious? usually the questions go the other way around, and i usually have to defend the fact that i do everything myself. live playing in a band is where the real musical paradise is, i just always felt unlucky enough that i grew up in a sort of social isolation, and combined with personality factors, just ended up alone and never able to find the right people. i always figured the light at the end of the tunnel would be eventually having enough influence and/or money that i could do have a medium/large band to actually direct, and afford to pay great people and really do it right"

        "question": "I noticed your songs page doesn't have every single jingle in MP3 format. Do the missing ones only exist as videos?",
        "answer": "it has always been confusing to draw the line for what to include on that page. it used to include only things that were written first as songs. then as there were more and more 'musical' vines, i felt it was unfair to not include some of those. so i ended up adding many of the musical vines, but still not including ones that rely on the video (how am i gonna include a \"how to fly a plane\" jingle, outside the context of explaining the answer?) as it is, it feels like there are way way too many short bits on the songs page, and that is compounded by the fact that i recorded a way too high percentage of short songs even before i started doing videos. this balance will hopefully finally be corrected soon when i start recording songs weekly or bi-weekly (WITHOUT also trying to do short vids every day like in 2014)"

        "question": "In your 'end of the world concert' song, do you know that song as 'On the Floor' or as 'Lambada'?",
        "answer": "it was inspired by the j-lo version (actually only the epic spiritual instrumental riff part of the song, not the generic saturday night drunk america part). i do realize that the melody is based on an ancient traditional song that has gone around the block numerous times throughout the ages, and i have heard those as well. but at the time i was playing the 2011, as is evident in the chords. this caused a bit of a mental dilema when posting it to the site, because i wanted to link the 'info' button to the most authentic and original version of the song, but the bottom line is, the chords for the original version are different. i was playing the chords for the j-lo version. so that is why i chose to link the info to the j-lo version. but really what i was referencing was only the riff portion of the j-lo version"

        "question": "I write music for fun and post it online or whenever I feel like it and have the time. I haven't released much, but the ones I have released I've put a ton of time and effort into. I've gotten a few offers from indie game developers, but always ended up declining due to confidence issues and so composers much younger than me end up getting the job instead. I'll listen to their final product and notice how generic it sounds or how I'm sure I could do better, but when I'm given the opportunity to do it I run away. What is wrong with me?",
        "answer": "the reason those \"other\" composers sound \"generic\" is because they are doing it as a job. a paid gig. if you are putting a lot of time and effort and care into what you are doing, then a paid situation is only going to drive you crazy. sure, there are 'paid' gigs for people who really care, but they pay WAY more, and you only get those gigs when you reach a more steven spielberg kind of level. these kids who are taking your gigs are working for cheap, and they don't care, and they don't have to care, because they are working for people who can't afford to pay them to care. real care is worth much, much, more than that. in fact, it's priceless. if you care, you need to take a very different approach, and find something else to do for work, and devote your true 'care' to what you really care about. in other words, if you try to sell your babies, you will only be undercut by somebody making cheaper and dumber babies. and that will be so uninspiring that it will ruin your day"

        "question": "What are your perceptions and/or deductions about the growing population around the world, due to increasing means to support children and less present factors that reduce population (i.e. Famine, disease, war, etc)? Do you think there will ever be government-implemented actions to reduce this increase, like restrictions on family size, or public awareness campaigns? What do you expect the reactions would be towards pushed legislation, and how would such arguments regarding rights and freedoms hold up against the possible detriments of reaching a point where food, water, and other resources are inadequate to support the people, leading into collapse of organized society, or government enforced regulation of food supplies and distribution? Is the forementioned distopia-like situation a ridiculous extreme? Would people be willing to accept the concept of a country stagnant in population growth over the personal shock of being limited to only on e or two children? How would the classes face this problem differently? Would the same laws apply to them, or would they be eligible to pay a hefty sum for the right to have anadditional child/children? Would religious groups earn separate benefits, as family dynamic is important in many of their teachings?",

        "question": "I used to sleep with this guy occasionally, and it was great. But it became clear that he always wanted a real relationship with me, and I wanted to keep things casual, so we drifted apart. About a year has gone by. I just found out he has a girlfriend now. The problem is, I REALLY want to hook up with him again. It's all I think about all day. I think I might be able to convince him to cheat on his gf with me (since he was always really into me), but that feels wrong. I could also try to break them up by pretending like I finally DO want to date him, and then just use him for sex for a while. But that option also feels wrong. A third option might be to ask for a threesome with him and his gf, but I doubt she'd consent to a threesome with one of his former lovers, and plus I don't know if I really want to hook up with a woman anyway. What do you think I should do??",

I've learnt a lot from reading many of your answers on this page. Thank you for that. I get the recurring uneasy feeling that I need to Create Art that I need to produce something beautiful with my own hands. But I am too busy consuming things instead. There are too many books to read, songs to discover, plays/films to watch. So much to learn. And such little time. Also the stupid but inescapable notion that nothing I create will be Good Enough, and other silly reasons that I keep putting it off like the decision about which tools to focus on becoming better at playing around with first. Words? Musical instruments? Cameras? I want to do it all but also sometimes I don't want to do anything. How does one consume less and create more?",

        "answer": "you are not giving me enough details for me to understand the context of this. to be fair, in my opinion the only way to really know how music goes is to hear it. all those chords could be voiced in a million different ways, and more important still is the timing. also, what the heck is VIIb6? don't you mean bVII6? also, i use chords as a way to support the song. i am usually not interested in evaluating chords outside of the context of the song. and if so, i would definitely need more specifics as to exactly how each one is voiced, in which octave, and more importantly the timing, tempo, etc. none of which can be determined by looking at a list of chords"

        "question": "This is similar to the job question that was asked earlier - but forgive me, it may be lengthy. Let's say you've been with a company for 1 month, and someone else was also hired at the same time as you, with a similar role. The other person learned the job quicker than you, and everyone in the department seems to love that person but not you. You feel it's partly because you took longer to learn and asked a lot more questions than the other person, and now your entire department basically doesn't treat you well. Even though now you are fairly confident with your responsibilities and have been doing good work. Should you stay, or pursue a job with a better \"crowd\" of people? I feel like this department I'm with involves a complete clash of personalities between me and them. Also important to note: This job is what I went to school for and pays very well. But I feel so shut out from my department that I'm basically desiring a customer s ervice j ob now, like I used to do. Help!!!",

        "question": "That question about a440 made me curious about an aspect of having perfect pitch (which I do not have) When I hear a note that is sharp or flat relative to its accompaniment it makes me feel very uncomfortable. I find myself straining as though I could correct the pitch with my thoughts alone -- much in the same way I might lean to one side to try to influence an errant bowling ball after it has left my hand. Do you ever get this feeling? If so, does it only occur for you when the tone is out of tune relative to the musical context? Or, having perfect pitch, does it also happen for you if the music is in tune with itself, but not with the traditional a440 tuning?",
        "answer": "anyone who claims to be 'irritated' when a recording is fully in tune with itself, but not tuned to a440, is faking it. this is not irritating, it's just a way to brag about having perfect pitch. even worse, many people who do this are actually wrong about it-- they will tell you the radio is out of tune because they speed up the songs to get more ads in, but that is not true anymore, now they can speed up the songs without changing the pitch, so everything you hear on the radio is in a440, for the most part"

        "answer": "OL = bass C, melody very strongly high Eb. harmonizing in the middle we have Ab, Eb, and i think very likely and subtlely there is a E note. also Bb underneath that. (so that makes it C+7#9). and for DIES, i am hearing more of a straight C7, including E, and G. (and still Bb) and i also am feeling the presence still of Eb (or maybe even Db) dirtying it up just a bit, which would mean either C7#9 or C7b9, but the presence of that note is extremely subtle (as well it should be) and might possibly just be the reverb ringing over from the previous chord. so OL is Caug7#9 and 'dies' is C7 with possible very subtle #9. the melody and bass notes are much stronger than the harmony notes, as they should be"

(some of the cheap ones don't have it). it is called 'dynamic sensitivity' and if a keyboard doesn't have it, even a perfectly good player will mysteriously sound like a toddler. it's not even fair. it would be like having only one volume for your voice-- you go to whisper in someone's ear, it comes out normal speaking volume. you are being attacked by wolves and you cry for help, and it comes out in a normal speaking volume. this would cripple your ability to express yourself, and the same thing would happen if you had a keyboard without dynamic sensitivity. don't make that mistake. again, you don't have to get an expensive keyboard, you just need to test it to make sure loud and soft notes are a thing"

        "question": "What do you do when you don't know how the next part of a song should go?",
        "answer": "clear your mind, and do accurate, timed run throughs! i usually do it with a click. and if i really get stuck, i do a 'door touch' to try to re-set my mind. i walk over to the door and touch the door knob and walk back to my seat and then play the song, all the way through. the more you can re-set your mind, the more accurate picture you will have of the song after doing a full run through. after doing an accurate timed run through, you will start to get a vision of an answer somewhere within the last few seconds of the known song, and it may linger within the first few seconds after you stop. it will start to fade after that. the whole secret is to pay very very close attention in this moment, and try to gather as much info as possible about the situation, (of course you might get lucky and lightening might strike and you might find the whole solution instantly) but try to play process of elimination -- sometimes you might find out you 'definitely don't want another chorus' or you 'definitely want something with the same chords' or you 'definitely want something different' or you 'definitely want something the same' .... try to listen to as many clues as you can find, to narrow it down, ... and then clear your mind and do another run through. don't forget that if you already have 'critical mass' in the song, you are never obligated to do anything more, the only thing you are obligated to do is 'carry the song home', which might even mean ending it sooner than you thought. or it might mean repeating what you have. or it might mean doing something totally different. it's important to stay very open, and again, the only thing that will really produce a reliable solution is clearing your mind, and an accurate, timed run through, and paying very close attention to the moment when you reach the end of the known material. i hope that helps"

        "question": "So I got access to many professional Big Band charts. I play to them on drums, but I think it would be cool to play to them on my keyboard. I know all the basics of a keyboard, because I'm a percussionist, and I know this will sound stupid, but what's Fm7 or Bb7 mean and how the Fuck do you play them. I believe they're chords, but what's the 7 mean??",
        "answer": "play the Ab note just below middle C, and also the Eb right above middle C. then play the F that is 2 and a half octaves below middle C. that is the Fmin7 chord. now for the other chord, keep all the notes the same but for the bass note, play Bb instead of F, and that high Eb move it down to D. that is how you play those 2 chords, in the context you are referring to"

        "question": "Hi Bill, I would like to talk to you concerning your \"history of japan\" video. Why have you glossed over the atrocities Japan has committed, which are major events in Japan's history? Examples include the Rape of Nanking, the South Korean Comfort Women, and the human testing conducted on Chinese civilians. These are important issues that cannot be forgotten. However, they are not present at all in your video, which has been viewed over 16 million times. This is encouraging the ignorance of the \"darker side\" of Japan's history. While countries such as Germany have deeply apologized for their war atrocities and engrain these events in teaching history to their students, the Japanese government has refused to apologize and Japanese textbooks are being revised to omit these events. I sincerely believe that you are a very learned and good person, thus I hope that you are aware of this and that with your large following and outreach, I hope that you may also raise awareness of this issue. Japan's war atrocities are not to be glossed over.",

        "answer": "not many times, only once. and there are multiple reasons why. the first reason would be the same reason that it is said that way in the first line of the song -- it is just better melodically. the second reason is because given that it already is that way at the beginning of the verse, the verse naturally wants to end the same as it started. and the 3rd reason it makes sense is that by immediately returning to false details after having explained the real truth, we have now firmly established the recurring theme of incorrect details, which is further developed later. i think if you try singing 'connecticut' in either of the first 2 locations where it's 'pennsylvania' i think you will find that it is not only extremely awkward, but also undermines one of the main concepts of the song"

        "answer": "i'm on 'phase 2' or the 'plan' stage, or 'pre-graphics', i am not sure what to call it. a lot of the graphic work actually gets done during this stage, it's basically like figuring out how the hell i am actually going to display on the screen what i just said in the script, and it actually inolves doing a lot more research, like nailing down exact geography specifics so i can show them on the map, or finding the images of people, etc etc. Like if i said \"and then the clowns took over\" ... a picture is worth a thousand words, so that may be fine for the script, but in order to show it on screen i have to know which clowns, i have to know what they were supposed to look like, i have to know exactly where they took over, so that often involves doing more research. or if i say 'then cheese wiz was invented' ... which cheese wiz was the first cheeze wiz? i can't just show modern cheese wiz and pass that off for the first kind. and a lot of times during this stage i may realize that a certain line in the script actually won't work, either because i realize it is innacurate, or maybe just doesn't seem good enough. so little revisions happen during this stage. also as i mentioned, the first draft was way longer than i wanted it to be, so when i do the re-writes i am always trying to say stuff quicker, and so far it is going great. every adjustment i have made has made it stronger and shorter at the same time. the shortening rate is averaging 18%, and i am at about the halfway point of the video"

I feel that way a lot when I'm making music - like I shouldn't care what people think and that I should just do what I know feels right, but then crippled when the things I make aren't liked OR affirmed when they are. you're in an interesting position because you claim not to give a shit (which I honestly believe is true) but people still love your work and tell you that all the time. you make whatever you want, but \"whatever you want\" wins awards. what should I do? how do I ignore them? or how do I balance these two contradictory parts of my brain?

        "question": "When you were working hard making 7 new Vines a week and then you started doing them even at a faster pace, do you have some regrets about it, do you feel some videos felt rushed or that quality suffered from the high production and output rate ?",
        "answer": "actually no. being forced to work fast is actually a huge blessing. creativity is so flexible, it is amazing the kind of decisions that you make when you have a deadline-- corners you cut, that you never would have dreamed of cutting if u had no deadline, but under pressure you make crazy decisions and your mind instantly gravitates toward the fast choices, and it also encourages you to gravitate toward more exciting choices to make up for the fact that you can't care delicately for every little thing. an example of one of my most intense time-crunches would be the babies-grownups-babies video. i took so many short cuts, and i was just throwing things in there so fast, and I was almost late for work (i am not telling you what my job is) but in the end, no one is complaining and look at all the stuff i have gotten done. given the demonic flexibility of the creative process, i am really feeling like i never want to work off-deadline again. i mean, I have been working off deadline on this current video for more than 4 months, and i THINK i'm going as fast as i can, but at the same time the video is much less than half done and i still have barely even gotten to the production. this is no way to live. i have a lot of stuff to do, songs, videos, so many things left to do and the years are going to fly by if i don't set some more insane deadlines. which is why i have recently set a deadline for the current video, which is completely unreasonable, and yet it is the best thing that has ever happened to me because it is making me get back into serious mad-crunch mode, which brings a much needed thrill to the never ending landscape of uncertainty of when this thing will ever be done"

I always have great ideas, working mostly with guitar I'll have a cool riff or chord progression but don't know where t go from there. I've tried to learn music theory but it's in one ear and out the other most of the time. Even with music theory, it ends up making my songs sound cookie cutter and the original part loses its special thing. Thanks for any advice, I'm a big fan.",

        "question": "You might be asked like thirty times before you write a response but in case you haven't, Vine had just announced that they are discontinuing their service in the coming months. They'll keep old videos online. I remember back before History of Japan you were kinda in a love-hate relationship with Vine because it allowed you to trim and really concentrate your content, but doing so was kinda addicting(?) in a way and it sorta stagnated you from making longer videos until you made the bold move to cut Vine off entirely during HoJ production. I'm sorry if this question seems to be spiraling out of control or maybe I'm just rambling, but I'm curious to understand why Vine was an appealing outlet for your content at the time and if you've \"grown out\" of it and don't mind the discontinuation too much or if you still have some fondness for that service. Thanks for reading, regardless!",
        "answer": "i was already making short videos (because it was a good way to get used to making videos), and about a year into it i found out there was a popular platform where the videos were supposed to be short, and they are auto-looped. so it seemed like a good decision to try to get the videos onto there. by the time i actually got most of them on there i was really getting ready to get Off the 5-day schedule and start looking at longer stuff. but then the popularity kicked in on vine (but still not so much on yt because vine doesn't let you put links to anywhere!!), so i had to do more short ones, just when i was really ready to do longer ones. so i had to sort of bend over backwards to condense the 7 day vine production down to as quick as possible to have enough time to try some long stuff, and after 3 months i finally finished one which actually did very well, and within a couple weeks i was doing better outside of vine than on vine. so by that point, not only have i made 200 more short videos than i ever really intended to, now i have a whole new audience which actually gets mad at me for doing short videos. so that's 2 reasons it's time to shift. don't get me wrong, i will still do things of all lengths and types. the original reason i did short things is because i like to do things of all different lengths, and i always wrote things of all different lengths, but the short ones are the quickest to produce, so i always fell into the trap of producing the short ones first, early on, because it is really the only way to get started"

        "question": "Looking back at the description of the Japan video, you said there was 1 day on temp narration and then on to the graphics, and then jingles. Just so I'm clear, are you currently on graphics?",
        "answer": "that's not quite what it was, but i am still not on the real 'graphics' phase. the current phase i'm still on (and will hopefully be done with in about 12 more hours!!) is kind of like a pre-graphics phase. call it 'pictures', call it 'image collection', call it 'graphics planning', call it 'phase 2', i can't figure out what to call it, and it doesn't really matter. but it involves taking what the words are, and then figuring out what exactly i am going to put in the graphics. like what am i gonna put on screen if i said *this.* a picture is worth a thousand words so it takes longer than you think. plus accuracy is really important. if an i say an earth quake happened in russia, i'm not just going to throw the earth quake in the middle of russia, i need to put it right where it actually happened. so phase 2 deals with all that stuff. including occasional re-writes, as i sometimes will realize that something in the script may be wrong or not work, and have to change it. all the re-writes are rock solid now, and another part of phase 2 is also done (which i can't really talk about right now, and is heavily related to graphics) and now i'm just finishing with pictures, at the 14 min mark as of today, moving roughly a second per minute (which is way up from before, i am setting timers every hour to track my progress and always find new techniques to really push it to the limit) but i will definitely be done with phase 2 like tomorrow. then i will lay down a temp narration for timing, and do temps for all the jingles, and put them in place so i have something to work over, and then do the real actual graphics, which will be what the video actually looks like. that took 30 days for history of japan, but this video is twice as long. the remaining tasks after that also took a total of 30 more days for history of japan, and again this video is twice as long. however, i have set a deadline for the entire video, which is approximately 33 days from now. as you can see there is a huge discrepancy from reality here. but that is how this needs to be approached. the deadline is causing me to think differently, and it is thrilling, and will at least cut the remaining production time in half, even if not the required 1/4x that would be needed to meet the deadline which is surely impossible but as i said i am still taking it seriously, i hope that answers your question"

        "question": "If the video is not finished by your deadline will you continue to work on it?",
        "answer": "of course. the deadline was deliberately set to be way sooner than reasonable, and it has always been technically impossible. but the crazy thing is, it has gotten way more possible since i have set it. having that deadline has caused serious miracles to happen. setting time clocks constantly for the entire day, tracking my progress, pushing every minute of every day to the absolute max. and i think it actually makes the video better, because it forces you to make stronger decisions to cope with less time doing tedious nitpicking. the deadline still remains impossible, but i continue to take it seriously, because it is actually becoming more possible. it is so revitalizing to work like this, i think i am never going to work off-deadline again, on anything"

        "question": "So with the Dec. 1 deadline, would you say your progress (both for the video and compared to the Japan video) is increasing exponentially?",
        "answer": "it increased a lot after oct 15, which is when i established the dec1 deadline, but since then i have pretty much maxed out. i am still setting timers and making minute by minute goals which are attempting to push it tigher, 1min20 seconds (on graphics) per day is about the most i think is possible, that's my grand record, on a full day. but i am still trying to beat that. in order to meet dec1, i pretty much have to be done with the graphics by this thursday (which would entail doing about 4min per day at this point) and even if i did that, i would still have to absolutely crush the rest, at unprecedented levels. still have to record the final narration, and final vocals for all jingles (which mostly has dense 4 part harmonies, as you know. and there's 66 jingles) and do the score, which probably takes the longest out of those 3 things. very important, i wish i could let you hear what history of japan sounded like with only narration and jingles and no underscored music (it is very boring, the underscore has huge effect on the video, that's why i underscore all my own music, moment by moment). Everything after graphics (score, jingles, narration, labels, troubleshoot, etc etc) for history of japan took a total of 30 days. so even if i finish graphics by thursday (wildly impossible) i would have to complete what was 30 days (for a 9 min vid) in 13 days (for a 19 min vid.) so basically that would require more than a 4x speed improvement from what i was doing in dec/jan last year on japan. but, graphics so far has generally been running at 2x speed from last year. i don't know how that's possible. maybe because i'm not trying to make vines every day? not really sure how to account for it, but i guess i have more experience now"

Before I state what the information i seek is, i would like to provide a small amount of knowledge. There is a page on this very website known as \"reality\". Upon the first viewing of that website, a screen is shown that says \"what's the password\". I, as well as many others who are like me, click on the button that says \" I don't know\" I am seeking the password, as I am very interested in what may lie beyond that wall. I believe that the world will be a better, more loving place if you would disclose this to the public. I am aware that this article may not be publicly displayed on this section of your web page, but I do ask that it may. With love, {Z}",

        "answer": "put notes in the bars. let's start with a \"quarter note.\" you can search online for what it looks like. we're not doing pitches right now, just rhythms. so it doesn't matter which line/space you put it on. just put 4 of them in the bar. a quarter note is 1 beat's worth. so if you put 4 quarter notes in each bar, that is basically like when we were counting beats before, except you are playing a note on every beat. if you search online you can probably find an image of exactly what 4 quarter notes in a bar looks like. if you can't figure out how to get your quarter notes looking right, i might be able to scrape together an image, but if you search for an image of 4 quarter notes you should see what this looks like. it is called quarter notes because it is 1 quarter of a bar. in another world, it might also be called a \"single note\" because it is one BEAT. that would be in a world where the notes where named based on beats. but they are not. in our world, (earth, etc) they are named according to how much of a bar they take up. (assuming your music has 4 beats in a bar, which most music does.) quarter notes. worth 1 beat. 4 can fit in an ordinary bar. put 4 quarter notes in the first bar. now go download a metronome and i will tell you the next step"

        "answer": "ok great. I will assume you know what all of those notes should look like. you pretty much mentioned all the important ones, except for sixteenth notes, which of course are twice as fast as eighth notes. there are some beaming rules for 8th notes and 16th notes, but first i want to make sure you know your 'rests.' a rest is a space where you don't play any note. it is a place holder, to let the time go by, and not play a note. there are all the same kinds of rests as there are notes (rhythm wise). quarter note rest (takes up one beat, or one quarter of the bar), eighth rest, 16th rest, half rest, whole rest. make sure you are familiar with all these. if you image-search any of those online you should see them instantly. So now in your second bar, put 2 quarter notes, then a quarter rest, then another quarter note. we are reading left to right here by the way. and the quarter notes and quarter rests should all be basically the same distance apart. now you can set your metronome (set it to about 70 bpm i guess) and then when you are ready to start, read what you wrote, by clapping. your instrument is a clap. clap when there is a note, don't clap when there is a rest. start whenever you are ready, but what it should sound like is you will be clapping on all the clicks for 6 clicks in a row, then a click with no clap, and then clap on the 8th click. that is what it would sound like if you clapped out what you have written. let me know if this makes sense. if you are confused i might be able to scrape together an image of what you should have written so far."

When an 8th note is by itself it uses a flag, but when it is in a group like in our example, it uses beams.) So now you should have a bar full of 8th notes. 8th notes are worth half a beat, or 1 eighth of a bar. if you clap out this rhythm, the claps will be evenly spaced, and there will be 2 claps per beat. in other words you will be clapping twice as fast as the click. If your tempo (speed) is 70bpm, then you can actually get a sneak preview of what this will sound like, if you set your metronome to 140. the 140 click would be what 8th notes would sound like at 70bpm. now set the click back to 70 and try clapping out the 8th notes at 70. i hope this makes sense"

        "question": "it's a bit annoying that people are imitating me and saying that they've done the next musical step. I have done what you said (beamed quavers etc) anyway. obviously these questions are open to the public (rightfully so) so anyone can gain from your answers. just a bit lame that they even try to copy my writing style haha. thanks for all the help so far",
        "answer": "i am sorry about that. i hope you have gotten the info you need. you asked so earnestly how to read i figured i would tell you the first steps. but you have followed all the steps so far, so i guess i have to keep giving the next steps. basically i am trying to get the rhythms squared away before you start doing pitches. i mean it's a very organized system. after getting this far, you should be able to figure it out yourself. once you know what quarter notes and 8th notes are you can easily figure out how 16th notes work. the beaming and flagging rules get a little interesting once you start putting rests in interesting places. but let's try this: let's do offbeat 8th notes. so that means start with an 8th rest (looks like a weird 7, for no reason) then an 8th note. NOT beamed, but it will have a flag. if you just look up an image for an eight note you should see it. looks like a quarter note with a flag on top. so do 8th rest, 8th note. four times, and that should fill up the bar. so it sounds the same as a bar full of 8th notes, but every other one (alternating) will be missing. if you could link me to an imgur image or something i could easily confirm if you are doing it right. but otherwise i will have to just hope that you are doing it right. if you play this rhythm, with a metronome, the notes will be exactly in between the clicks. i hope that makes sense. please i would like to remind everyone that this is a multi part question that was started on 11.29.16 at 1:52pm, with the question \"how to learn to read music?\". If you are prompting me to go to the next step, and you are not the original person who posted that question at that time, you are being dishonest, and that is something you are going to have to live with"

        "question": "Regardless of how you see yourself, a lot of people see you as a \"big-shot\" because of your massive jump in popularity from the Japan video, and the fact that you're much more \"popular\" and well-known than they are. Plus, this is pretty much the only direct interaction fans can have with you.. Maybe it wasn't on purpose, but you've gotten a lot of people to really care about asking questions here, but I don't think you mean for this to really be that serious. I don't expect to necessarily get a serious answer out of you with this, but it's worth a shot.... What exactly IS this page to you? Is this just a fun little side thing? Should I not really take anything here too seriously?",

        "question": "I've drawn out the eighth rests/notes- is there any convention about where to position rests relative to the notes? here's an image of what I've done http://imgur.com/on9WYJ5 (also thank you for addressing the imitation stuff)",
        "answer": "looks great. the note heads might not need to be so big and full, but that is something you will get the hang of as you continue writing. of all your rests the first one looks the best, but even that doesn't need to be as perfectly drawn as you have drawn it. if you start to write a lot of music you will find quicker ways of just zinging everything in. note heads usually turn into almost a slanted line. anyway, it looks great. the alignment is good. usually alignment should adhere basically to the timing, but in some cases you can stretch it a little for readability. for example if you have a bunch if 16th note crap on one side of the bar and nothing in the other side sometimes you may stretch the complicated side out a little bit. anyway, that looks great. 16th notes are just like 8th notes, but they use 2 flags instead of 1 (or a double beam instead of 1.) ok i think you are good with rhythms for now. i think the next step is to figure out the pitches. the next step might be different depending on what instrument you are most familiar with. if you are not familiar with the layout of notes on a piano, learning to read might be a total nightmare. i'm not sure. but try putting notes on every line and every space. the notes in your example are perfectly aligned in the space (that would be A in treble clef). when a note is on the line, it should be the same size, so the top and bottom of the head should reach about halfway thru the space on either side of the line. i would say, make a bunch of notes in a row, going up. just like you would write a series of quarter notes, but don't use any stems, and don't use any bar lines. ignore the time for now, just line them all up. kind of like an ascending staircase of notes. start anywhere (probably on the bottom line? or you can even start with one just below the bottom line if you want) and put the notes in, going up. line, space, line, space, etc. news flash this is the white keys on a piano. i will tell you which ones they are later. i hope this makes sense"

        "answer": "ok great. so your example shows 11 notes. they are all white keys on the keyboard. but the keyboard goes way higher and lower than that, all the notes could never fit into this one staff. so we need to specify what range we are in. actually there are only 2 commonly used range settings for the staff (the settings are called 'clefs') the most commonly used ones are treble and bass. let's look at treble for now. to specify that your staff is being used as a treble cleff, you need to put a treble clef symbol at the far left side of the staff, before the music starts. the treble clef symbol is crazy. good luck learning to draw it, but when you do learn it is fun. i usually start from the bottom, and draw a straight line up and then curve around and down. i think that is the easiest way to draw it. ok, so make a treble clef symbol on the left, and then make another staircase of notes, except this time start one lower than you started before (but what? there is no line there?) well make a tiny piece of a line, just big enough to house the note. then put the second note where your first note was in the previous example. make a total of 8 notes. your first and last note will be C. this is a C major scale. the lower C (the one you had to make a special line for) is called middle C. on a guitar, it is the first fret on the B string. on a bass guitar it is the 17th fret on the g string. on a piano it is somewhere in the middle of the piano. the frequency is about 262hz. let me know if you have got the scale written"

        "question": "i've been teaching myself how to play the piano for a while now, but the one thing i can't get down is playing with two hands at once (like have the 'background track' playing with one hand and the main tune with the other, if you get my meaning). any tips? thanks, love your stuff by the way.",
        "answer": "i am actually not so keen on that either. to do that, you basically need 3 elements- bass, chords, and melody. that's 3 things, and you only have 2 hands. there are different strategies -- one is to play the bass with your left hand, and chords with your right hand, and sing the melody. another strategy is to play in a band where there is a bass player, your left hand plays chords, your right hand plays the melody (that would be like in a jazz trio or whatever). or maybe there is a bass player and a singer also, in which case you have both hands free to do the chords. the piano is used in many different contexts, and in many different ways. if you are trying to do an entire piece of music by yourself, i think it is better to do the melody and chords in the same hand (right hand) and play the bass with your left hand. so basically just harmonize the melody, and keep the melody note on top of each chord. because if you have chords in your left hand then there's no bass? so that would be awkward. here's the issue i have with the whole situation-- i think in most music, the melody is actually in the same range as the chords. so if you are doing chords and melody at the same time on the same instrument, they are really going to occupy the same space on the keyboard. that is why i prefer to keep them both in the same range. there are so many different ways to make music, you have to just experiment and do what is right for the situation, depending on whether or not you are singing, and/or if you are playing with other players"

        "question": "luckily treble clefs used to be my favourite thing to doodle on school work. I've got the scale written. I could send a pic if you want but I'm pretty sure it's ok. what's next?",
        "answer": "ok, let's figure out how to make the other notes (the black keys). you will need flat and sharp symbols. let's use E. make an E note (it doesn't matter what rhythm it is). To make it an Eb (E flat) put the flat symbol immediately to the left of the note, aligned on the same line or space as the note. the flat symbol looks kind of like a lower case b, make sure the bump on the b is aligned the same way as the note. so if your note is on the bottom line (E) the flat symbol should be aligned to the bottom line, and just to the left of a note. if you make a line of E's, then make an Eb, you can keep making Eb's without putting any more flat signs. the flat symbol stays in effect for that note until the end of the bar. (some people say it's until the end of the line? not really sure actually. let's assume it is effective until the end of the bar.) Let's make a string of 8th notes (beamed in groups of 4), and put a flat symbol next to the 3rd note. now put a NATURAL symbol \u266e next to the second to last note. the natural symbol is aligned according to the box in the middle. so put that box right on the same line (or space) as the note. the natural symbol is a way to undo the flat symbol. so if you have written this correctly, you should have 2 E notes, then 4 Eb notes, then the last 2 would be back to E (natural, which means not flat or sharp.) and you will have only used 1 flat sign and 1 natural sign. i hope this makes sense"

        "question": "done the f notes- https://imgur.com/a/W96VD another question: f sharp and g flat are the same on the piano right? is there a reason you'd pick one over the other when writing?",
        "answer": "yes they are the same. there are various reasons you might choose one over the other. when we get into key signatures you should see this a little more clearly. if you have d, e, f#, g, a, you always want to use f# there instead of Gb because that way you have one letter for each note (one note on each line or space). if you used Gb in that situation, you would have no Fs and 2 Gs and you would have to keep flatting and unflatting the G. the 5 notes i just mentioned are actually part of a D major scale. so when you are in D major, for example, you can actually put the sharp symbol on the F line, at the beginning of the chart, (and also on C#, for the key of D) and then you can just use all the notes normally from D to D, and it automatically makes a D major scale because you already specified that the F and C notes are always sharp. (that is called a key signature). if you tried to use Gb and Db to make a D major scale, you would have to constantly be flatting and naturaling the D and G. it would be a freakin mess. but with a key signature, you just flip the F and C to sharps at the very beginning, and then all the notes in your staff automatically make D major. then if you want to flip to D min for a moment, you can use a natural sign on the F to make it temporarily natural. let me know if this makes sense and then i can try to show you the key signatures in a logical order"

        "answer": "ok let's make a melody and then put it in different keys. the melody is going to be 8 8th notes in the first bar, then 2 quarter notes and a half note in the second bar. a half note looks like a quarter note with a hollow head, and it rhythmically lasts for 2 beats, or half of the bar. the notes are going to be: c d e g f e d c b, d, c. Start on middle C, which is that one off the bottom that needed a special piece of a line (that's called a ledger line by the way). there are no big jumps in this melody, so assume that each note is the one nearest to the previous (not an octave away). the highest note would be g, the lowest note is B, which is actually below the ledger line! so you have to make a ledger line just like you did for C, but put B below it. you don't need to make a ledger line for D. so this tune should have a total of 4 ledger lines. again, a ledger line is that little piece of a line that you made for C when it was off the edge of the staff. ok so that's the melody. try to sing or play it if you can. then we are going to move it into different keys and see which flats or sharps we need to use"

        "answer": "i keep getting the feeling that you already know all this stuff, because you are doing everything perfectly, including things i haven't said yet (like the time signature). ok so take a look at the keyboard. play a C major scale (that's all the white keys from C up to C.) you will notice that all the notes are NOT actually the same distance apart, sound wise. to prove this, start on B and play all the white notes from B to B, it does NOT sound like a B major scale. to actually play every note you would include the black notes too. when you just play the white notes, you are getting a combination of larger and smaller intervals (called a 'whole step' or 'half step') depending on whether there is a black note in between. if you play all the notes going up, including white and black, you would get ALL half steps. i'm sure you already know all this. But let's look at the keyboard again, and look at the pattern of white/black keys, near the C note. you will notice that there is Another place on the keyboard where this pattern is almost the same, and that is near F. in other words, the black/white key configuration surrounding F is very similar to the black/white key configuration surrounding C. so start playing a scale starting from F, and play all the white notes from F to F. you may notice that this sounds Almost like an F major scale, but one note is wrong. the B. you can clearly see that that is where the black/white key pattern is not the same as it would have been for C. in C, going from the 3rd to 4th note there is no black note in between. but in F, there IS a black note there. in order to play a major scale right, that 3 to 4 interval needs to be a half step, just like it is in C. so when we play in F, you need to use the Bb note INSTEAD of B. play Bb, skip B. so play F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F. and that should sound like the F major scale. as long as all the B's are always flat, you are safely in F major. when we write, this is where you use a 'key signature'. put a flat sign on the middle line. this goes right after the treble clef symbol, and before the time signature. this one flat will apply to every B in the tune, including the higher and lower ones! that's just the way it works. but don't put the key signature on the one you wrote in C! that would mess it up. start a new one, put the flat on the B line (again that is the F key signature), and write the melody again, starting on F! you almost don't even have to know the notes, just follow the same pattern through the scale. up 1, up 1, up 2, down 1, etc. when the melody moves up one, it goes from a line to a space (or space to a line). when it goes up 2, it goes from space to space, or line to line. these are the patterns you are looking for when you read and write, and as long as you get your key signature right, it should be pretty easy. let me know if you need me to name the notes, but i would guess that you have this whole thing figured out by now."
