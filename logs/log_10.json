(which is interesting, because that's technically not the question that was asked; that's a reaffirmation of what the question presumed to be true already in its phrasing, that everything was stupid. but it also might be an answer to the question anyway, in the stupidest possible way: everything is stupid because it's stupid. that's a pretty stupid answer, which seems about right.) the 'rock in a plaid shirt' part seems to be a kind of last-ditch effort at something that isn't stupid, something new, but it all goes w rong, an d it sounds like (with the falling pitches and the final kick drum hit on 'stupid') that the end of blades of grass really was meant to be an admission of defeat. i just thought this was odd considering that you seem to be a fan of stupid; the two 'stupid songs' you've made seem to suggest you think stupidity can get you to stronger songs, videos, etc. but in blades of grass it seems like stupidity stands for a lack of meaning, and there's no way you're trying to say that nothing means anything - that's like the ultimate anti-bill wurtz sentiment as far as i can tell. let me know if any of this seems comprehensible to you. thanks",

        "question": "why was the time between the draft composition/writing of \"and the day goes on\" and its release date 699 days?",
        "answer": "i will explain the timeline so hopefully it will make sense. in march 2015, the instrumental idea for the verse occured to me. i was not expecting it, it was not a planned 'writing session'. This is how many songs get started, they drop out of the sky, so you have to get good at catching them. So, this is me catching it. (march 2015). Sure, i could have immediately gone into a writing session for that idea, but, why not instead for an idea i had had the previous day? or a video idea i had had the previous day? it is always raining ideas. There is always more to be done than there is time to do. In march 2015 i had developed a 2 pronged approach: 2 short videos per week, and 'everything else'. I was doing 2 short videos per week just to have something to release, then in between, move forward on longer projects. I had a randomized selection scheme to help choose which longer projects to do. Near to that time, the 'crazy/raining' song was selected. That took several weeks. After that, it was the 'free to do whatever you want to' song. This took even longer. What also was happening at the same time was, my short videos had taken off on the vine platform. So i had made the decision to start vinifying my entire video catalog starting with the earliest, and posting them to vine every day. Around august (2015) i reached the end of the catalog so i had to make a decision about what to do going forward. i decided the vines were doing so well that it became important to make 7 new ones per week. This was unfortunate for my longer video aspirations, because it pretty much meant zero time leftover to pursue that. but it was important to keep things rolling on vine. So i carried on like this for about 2 more months, but my desire to make long videos was getting even more intense. I discovered a trick, where i could spend the first half of the day working on a long video, and not start the vine until the second half of the day, which forced me to do them much quicker. so i started on history of japan (oct 2015). i continued on like this, doing short videos while doing a long video, and finally around january i was getting into the scoring process (final stage) of the japan video and decided that i should pause the vines in order to finish the japan video more quickly. japan was finished by late january, it went to youtube and did very well there. i took this as a chance to put together a project i had always really really wanted to do but never found time: to make videos out of journal edits. i had about 6 years of audio journal content, and i combed through it as best i could, making video edits to attempt to chronicle my journey. After about 2 months working on this, i really had to cut it short because it was going on way too long. so i really only got to do about 10% of what i wanted. Also the other half of that project was for improv footage. I had to cut that way way short because no regular videos were being done during this time. So i only got a chance to do maybe 2% of the improv edits i wanted to do. So finally around May (2016) i was ready to get back to regular videos. there was so much i wanted to do, and didn't even know where to begin. I started extremely short, as i normally do, with a plan to make them gradually longer. I started making an agenda list of the sequence of upcoming items, and i wanted to include some medium length songs. Choosing from a list of hundreds, one of the ones i chose was that instrumental chord sequence back from march 2015. So i wrote that into a full song, over a couple of days. this song was called 'and the day goes on.' Among other short videos, there was also another song that i selected at that time, for release soon after. which i also wrote fully at that time. called 'hallelujah'. we are around june 2016 now. Then, suddenly, i felt a lot of public outrage that i was 'still doing short videos', and to be honest, i agreed with it. I also had a pent up desire to do an even more bombastic history project than the japan one, so i changed the plans, cancelled the remaining short-medium projects, and started on history of the entire world. Something you may or may not know about the history of the world- the world has a lot of history. so, to put it all into 1 video is probably impossible, so i knew i was taking on something that might be impossible. but i wanted to do it anyway. so first i had to *learn* the history of the entire world. which also takes a long time. research and writing took all summer, and i reached the end of the writing by about September 7, 2016. One of the things i had been thinking during the writing process, is a 2D equirectangular projected map is probably not gonna work for this. i should really get it on a 3D globe. but i didn't have the tools for that. so during most of september i was experimenting with various 3D tools to try to meet my 3D needs. i also began going through and developing the images that would be needed for the video, while also making many changes to the script. By the end of october i had most of this squared away, and around November 1st i was ready to begin the full video production. At this point i was determined to reach the end of the entire project by december 1st, and i nearly destroyed myself throughout november trying to meet this. but toward the end of november i realized this wasn't even close to possible. so i continued through december, through many of the most challenging parts of the video production, especially having to correct some problems with the 3D globe animations (which had been first done in october). finally made it to the end of the visual production by about february 7 (2017), and began on recording the final narration, and doing the final jingles, and then finally doing the score. the video was finally finished around may 10, 2017. By this time i knew very well that i really just need to do songs for the rest of my life. So i decided to skip the videos and just do audio songs, 1 per week. this went ok, but i soon realized that videos are very important. so around late june (2017) i started on 2 projects simultaneously: a freeform non-song video (hi, i'm steve) and a music video for one of the recently released audio songs (movie star). Working on 2 things at once is usually a recipe for failure, so i did then one at a time. steve first, then movie star. Then onward, to the next music video, 'outside'. this took about 6 weeks. I've never been pleased by the amount of time it takes to do these things. my prefered target for music videos would be 1 week, but to this day i've never been able to accompish this. Nearing the end of the 'outside' project, in late september (2017), i made a demand of myself that i MUST do these in 2 weeks. and i also felt it was necessary to do non-songs as well. So, alternate betwen non-songs and songs, and also, 1 out of every 2 songs should have live performance footage. So the next item would be a non-song, and, because i was able to make it shorter, i was able to do it just barely in 2 weeks. this was called 'soap tips' and was completed around oct 10, 2017. The next thing would have to be a song, and it would have to include live performance footage. Unfortunately this shattered all previous records for how long a music video should take, and this is probably because i hadn't appeared in live performance footage in such a long time that i couldn't stop myself from being incredibly particular for how things appear. i was horrified by the fact that that project ultimately took exactly the same amount of time as history of japan had taken (98 days, or 14 weeks.) it was finally completed in january, 2018. the target of course was 2 weeks, but that was a hopeless failure. So my next revision of the plan, would be to do 2 weeks per video, but they don't have to be a song. because i knew song videos would take longer, probably because my standards for how long a song should be were somewhere around 2:30 to 3:30, where as the non-song videos could be as short as 1 minute or maybe even less. so i decided to just try 1 video per 2 weeks, not necessarily a song. I was able to succeed at this, just barely, with 2 non-song videos. But, of course, as fate would have it, i realized songs are incredibly important. So i decided to do a song next, i already knew i wanted to do 'and the day goes on', because that one had its writing completed (in 2016) and i thought it was a strong one that i was confident about. I decided 4 weeks would be a sensible target for that. it was an especially elegant target, because it was february, and in that year (most years) februrary is exactly 4 weeks, so that would put the release date on exactly the same day of the month as the previous. Unfortunately that proved again to be impossible. and it never helps that my standards usually continue to go up. I was very meticulous on most parts of the process. i finally was able to complete the video around april 25, 2018. i immediately moved on to start the next song project. It's worth mentioning what happens next, because that will help bring this into even more perspective for you. At the start of every song process, i first do a generalized idea having process, where i come up with brand new ideas for songs. I usually do about 5 or 10, THEN the song selection process begins, where those new ideas are put into the much larger pool of unfinished songs, and i select from the entire list. It looks like there were 9 new ideas created on april 26 and 27, 2018. What ended up being selected, for the next song, was none of those, it was one that was already in the broader list ('hello sexy pants'). But, of those new 9, many of those have been extremely strong contenders every time since, with many of them almost getting picked, and one of them being 'when i get older' which was picked later that year. To get back to your original question, i think one of the strongest factors in play here is the fact that it is impossible to do everything at the same time, although that would be extremely convenient for me"

It was kind of frustrating though, cause some of their critiques were things that I did on purpose. I think the rules of grammar are made up too, like someone just decided that there was a right way of writing things down.

        "question": "i keep having ideas when it's hard to write them down (shower etc.) and if i do go to write the idea down i usually forget most of the details. and if i deliberately put myself into a situation where i can easily write things down (usually by having my ideas document open or by using an audio recorder), then i can't have ideas. it feels like it's only possible for me to either have ideas or remember them, but not both.",
        "answer": "that's true, ideas come most easily when they would be harder to write down. There are 2 strategies for the shower. one strategy, if you think the idea is really that good, just get out of the shower and go write it down. Or, if you don't want to do that, here are some memory tricks. pretend you are explaining the idea to someone else, and start explaining it in as many technical ways as you can. Pretend you have to explain it to them so that they can reproduce the idea exactly, but, you are not allowed to actually demonstrate it. For example, if it's a sentence, say \"the first word is ___, the second word is ____,\" etc... Count the words. remind yourself how many words there are. Say all the odd numbered words. Say all the even numbered words. Think of the first letter of each word, and put all those letters together. try to come up with an alternate sentence using the same starting letters. Try to access the idea in as many different ways as you can. If it is a musical idea, start thinking of the notation of it, imagine you are explaining the musical notation to someone else without singing it. List the notes in order. Count the notes. List the rhythmic values in order. If you don't know musical notation in this way, hopefully you have some other conceptual notation system you use to think about notes and time. What tempo is it? what song has a similar tempo? how many notes are in the first beat? how many notes are in the second beat? etc etc etc. Keep trying to access the idea on as many mental avenues as you can, and this will increase the likelyhood that you will be able to retrieve it. but really the best option is to just get out of the shower. Most other places besides the shower, try to carry a recording device with you, the most common one being a smart phone. and if you have that, then much of these techniques will not be necessary"

He often talks about a lot of his greatest hits having lyrics that simply sounded right and have the feeling that the music has, rather than having lyrics that have been agonized over for a long time, like Mrs. Robinson. Something I hear him say a lot is \"I don't really know what that meant when I wrote it, but later I realized...\" Is that in any way your process of writing lyrics, that the goal is that they sound like the music? Or do you craft them to both sound right for the music and mean something intentional and consciously thought of?",

        "question": "How did you predict 2020 in \"just did a bad thing\"? \"All the things I'm supposed to do / and the places I'm supposed to go are cancelled\" What is the real meaning behind this line?",
        "answer": "things predict themselves. that's what i like about songwriting, it opens the door for things to do what they're gonna do here's what i think, as i'm analyzing it now: this is a classic case of the song being about itself. The starting point for that song was just the one line ('just did a bad thing'), with really no indication of any sort of form or anything. Half way through the first section, it already seems to ditch out of the original paradigm slightly ('wondering what it is, etc'), it slips into the major key, and just,... no sort of repeating figure has been established. so far everything seems to be a special-case scenario. Then when it hits the next stanza, (bad day, bad year), we've already broken from what it had done in the first stanza. (the first stanza had the 'regret' line, which is quite different from the first line, but in the second stanza, the first two lines essentially are the same as each other), so for many reasons, at this point, (after 'bad year'), it's very clear that there is NO established pattern. we are free to roam. And it's likely at this point that i was feeling stuck, because really there's just too many possibilities. I was probably running through what i had so far, thinking i would get clues about the future (of the song) from the past (in the song). And that's just not gonna happen, because really what should probably happen is it should probably get out and GO somewhere it hasn't gone yet. So, looking at what did come next, the 'cancelled' line, this is a perfect way of expressing that everything you might have expected was going to happen (based on what happened so far) in the song, will probably not happen. And, sure enough, immediately after this, it transitions into a totally new key, and a new paradigm entirely. So basically the reason for that line is to shake off the previous paradigm (bad things, etc), because we gotta get away and jump into a whole new territory. (the 'game' section, etc). As far as anything having resemblence to future world events, well, this is always more likely to happen the more songs i write. when making a case that something predicted something, you can always ignore the ones that didn't fit. such as 'at the airport terminal' which certainly does not predict 2020"

        "question": "My favourite thing about your music is that your lyrics are so interpretable. They might seem random to some but I've always felt they are just specific enough to be applied many different scenarios, usually someone who is going on some kind of journey. Personally, I've often noticed transgender themes that seem to be present in your lyrics. In both And The Day Goes On and Outside you talk about changing your name, and When I Get Older has that lyric about changing your face. I've also clocked similar themes of understanding identity and leaving previous lives behind in order to explore things that are considered taboo in songs like Mount St. Helens, We Could Just Get High, I'm Best Friends With My Own Front Door, Movie Star, and It's Gonna Be Alright (I could list specific examples but it would take too long). Just curious what your thoughts are on this interpretation?",

It sounds really good and seems really powerful to me and I really want to write a song around it but I can't figure out what I want it to mean. I don't know how literal I want it to be, I don't know what parts of it should and shouldn't be a metaphor, etc. Any advice?",
        "answer": "yes, if you can't figure out what to do with it, add it to the list. If you want to try to figure out what to do with it now, add it to the list anyway, but, the first step in figuring out what to do with it is: figure out if it's the beginning or not the beginning. If you're sure it's the beginning, then just figure out what comes next, and if you're sure it's not the beginning then you're kinda fucked, but i have some tips for that too"

So when there is any type of snare sound, clap sound, or strong mid-high percussion sound, occuring repeatedly on anything that could be percieved as beats 2 and 4 (out of 4), this should be assumed to be what's called the 'backbeat', and therefore on 2 and 4"

How do you feel about that interpretation? I know you're probably going to say something along the lines of \"there are no wrong interpretations\" but is this one that you intended or accounted for? While I agree that your music does have that facet, I personally feel like there is so much more to it than some seem to give you credit for. It saddens me a bit when I see your music being written off like that but then again maybe I'm taking it too seriously as well?",
        "answer": "that seems like a pretty negative interpretation, so i am going to either assume it is your interpretation, or you are deliberately trying to deliver negative feedback to me no You are playing a classic game of 'good cop, bad cop', where you assure me that you like me more than anyone else does"

What i can do, is try to explain why they are in the song. 1. imagine birds' destiny being so intertwined with trees that it becomes impossible to keep track of which one is made of whom 2. i had NOT explained it before, but i said i had 3. birds already fly so they shouldn't need planes basically, these 3 points might not seem useful, unless you think songs should contain fun and tricks"

Also keyboards can interface very well with computers, so that is a huge gateway to a lot of possibilities in the modern world. On the other hand, guitars are a very interesting alternative to keyboards. they have a much more readily acoustic quality, although it is not as easy to pick and choose exactly what notes you want to use"

        "answer": "because, the way that song feels, (the one about holding on to what you've got, etc etc) it just feels like a song that should be called \"The ____ Song\". this is strange, because i think i had to actually call that one \"Stupid Song\", but that one definitely feels like it should be called \"The Stupid Song\". You would think the other one should then be called \"Stupid Song\", because in fact, that other one (hold my hand / touch my face, etc) seems like more of just \"a stupid song\". that is how i think of that one. But, because of the silly nature of that song, as part of the sillyness, it becomes very important to call that one \"The Stupid Song\", to bring it that sense of conviction in its stupidness. So the truth is that the best title for both songs is \"The Stupid Song\". which is a mildly unfortunate coincidence, for the sake of the catalog"

Or do you more tend to focus on the things that you could improve/did wrong/didn't know at the time? On a semi-related note, artistry. What the hell is it and how do you become bold enough to actually create shit that's you? The more I continue to live, the more I feel like I'm just an interpreter and can't really achieve a level of originality that is meaningful or worthwhile. I know I'm capable of writing. I've done it. But i also paralyze myself with the fear that what I write won't be world-altering, which of course it won't be - i haven't done a lot of writing so I don't have the practice. But then I don't practice writing as much as I should because I'm scared my stuff won't be world-altering. And then it feels like it reflects on me. I tend to hide on the arranger side because I can feel safe in the comfort of someone else's writing. If my shit don't s lap, well, I can't be entirely to blame, it's not my tune. But if my original shit don't slap . guess that means I just don't slap as a musician/human. Any thoughts or advice on how to exist and create? (P.S. Sorry for the length, your wisdom inspires me)",
        "answer": "sometimes sometimes at some point, if you still can't seem to do it, just start doing anything you can. you may be surprised how quickly you realize you can actually do everything a fun fact about world-altering: it's actually possible to do certain things that seem so NON world altering, that it actually seems world-altering in its level of non-world-altering. Which therefore immediately creates quite an earth-shattering feeling, as it becomes clear that you've just altered the world by seemingly not altering it well that's fair, because some people only write and they're gonna need arrangers so far you are doing pretty good"

        "question": "In your song \"La de da de da de da de day oh\" Does the line \"When did all the windmills start to turn so slow?\" Have any real world significance. I don't know why but it just seemed like a deep line, wanted to know your thoughts",
        "answer": "it was begging to be written. as i was writing the choruses before that, i kept trying to say \"when did\" instead of \"where did\". there was a \"when did\" line lurking around for the whole time i was writing. then in the extra chorus it came out as the only obvious choice"

Is it weird to go back and watch them several years later for editing? P.S. You seem like a cool dude and your latest video is pretty rad. Are there plans for a regular schedule in the future? I saw that you said you like to post weekly on another question, is that a possibility at the moment? Thanks :)",

P.S. The numbers here could either severely underestimate or overestimate the reality of the matter and the way/speed/quantity you can create and produce stuff, but I hope you get my overall point that two types of schedules could cancel the anxiety and negativity that comes from the other.",

        "question": "you say that you try not to use nonsensical lyrics, yet on the surface some of your lyrics are easy to interpret as nonsensical, so i'm curious. what was the meaning behind the first verse of \"i'm best friends with my own front door\"?",
        "answer": "i'm curious if you are just reading them, with no music. they're not guaranteed to work like that basically i was starting on a new experiment: finish an entire music video in 2 weeks or die trying. i was sick of failure, i had been trying to do this and kept failing. the previous several videos all took 8 weeks or more. and i just was so desperate and felt like my life was passing me by, so i just snapped and demanded myself to succeed at 2 weeks. So i'm going through the (long) list of songs and song ideas to choose from, and, ...... it's just not working. i'm going through the list for hours, not finding one i want to do. So at some point, my brain just said \"what would the song you Want to do now sound like?\" and spontaneously the first line hit me, and i knew immediately that that would be the next song. So i already know it feels right, seems right, means very much to me, etc, but, when i think about it i can also explain why this is. It's like i'm developing a friendliness toward the idea of just... walking out the front door. Just being honest with my situation, ... etc. and picking this next song should be something as easy as just opening the front door, in a friendly manner. Now the second line, again this all came to me instinctually, but i'm just trying to think about it now and explain it.... the second line ('i just closed it but it's opening more') .... this gets deeper because there is the feeling that even if i've failed to notice how easy things could be, ... the door is actually opening on its own. We all know we have the tendency to sometimes overlook the friendly and obvious choices in life, so i think this line gives me a pretty strong feeling because it's like it's saying, even if you miss it, the opportunity will grow more to make you notice it. And the next 2 lines, ('then the cops came and they sent me to jail, but tomorrow i'm gonna open it again'), and again this is not supposed to necessarily work good without the music. so please take this only in the context of the way it sounds in the song. So these 2 lines seem to be basically doubling down on this optimism: the 3rd line is like \"nope, youre gonna get punished for taking the easy route\", then the 4th line shows determination to overcome this. Another bit of optimism is tucked in here also because most jails don't let you open the door. So you're just saying, tomorrow you're gonna get another chance to easily and friendily open a door that was previously assumed to be unopenable."

        "question": "When people say to me \"your mixes sounds thin/muddy because of the arrangement\", I kind of understand where they're coming from - frequencies clash, they can't occupy the same space etc etc. But is this what people really mean by \"arrangement\"? Because I feel like there's gotta be more to it. Can you shed light on this? What is a \"bad\" arrangement and what is a \"good\" arrangement?",
        "answer": "in terms of sound clarity, basically you just want to get as much power out of as few sounds as you can. when it gets too cluttered, it turns to mud. But, when you have less, sometimes it may feel like you need more power. it's a paradox that sometimes feels like it takes a lifetime to overcome. but everyone gets better at this, the more they do it. The issue goes back further than arranging, ..... ultimately it goes back to the songwriting. if you write a song good enough, it's almost impossible to fuck it up later"

        "question": "i have been making music as a hobby since March last year, and I frequently find myself getting attached to the verse chorus verse chorus bridge chorus structure. i have tried really hard to do something different because i am getting really bored of it. whenever i do something different, i'm just not happy with the results. either that, or i get stuck in nowhere. any ideas on how to overcome this? also, i dont know a lot of music theory. do you think spending time on learning music theory could help? thanks!",
        "answer": "check all the songs you listen to. see if any of them do something besides that form. See if there are any songs you really really like, that don't follow that form. figure out what it does instead. figure out what you want to call that. Just check out all the songs you know and see what kind of roadmap they're using. Just take some time and enjoy some different road maps. eventually they will all come out in your writing if you've been making music, then you are the one with the theories. Maybe it's time for you to teach those theories......."

        "answer": "i don't use loops do a fresh run-through from the beginning, at the exact tempo. the more refreshed you are, the better this will work. It works the best if you haven't heard the song in a day. do a fresh run-through, and then just as you start to approach the end of what you have, that is when lightning will strike, if it does. listen very closely in that moment, and try to gather as many details as you can about what you think you are hearing next. Another trick which often produces results is to imagine the song is taking place in a scene. imagine a visual story for the song to take place in. Also another thing i almost forgot to mention, in case you are not doing already, try to use words/language for this"

        "question": "I'm a high school music teacher, and I get the sense that you avoid talking about your school years because you've realized what pretty much every musician needs to realize at one point or another if they are going to improve their musicianship. That the only person who can improve your musicianship is you. You have to the do the work, the ear training, the practicing, the time song writing and creating. So here's my question(s). How did you develop your work ethic for creating music? Did people in your life have an influence on you developing this skill? What do you think music teachers could be doing better to try and foster this skill in other people?",
        "answer": "it's similar to the way a person might develop a habit of using crack-cocaine, except instead of 1 drug it's more like 1000, because there is at least 1000 different ways to become totally and deeply hooked into music i was able to hear a lot of music on records (and through the television of course, paired with visuals in such a way that i may not even realize until decades later just how crucial the audio-visual relationship is) and i will confess i also had access to a piano/keyboard instrument, and a drum set. There were also guitars around, but i've always been a bit overwhelmed/intimitated by guitars. having an extremely early start, it was pretty natural to find myself in many many personal and professional music relationships with peers (well at first it was usually people much older than me because i was so young to start) what i think is the best approach, for me personally, is to write and record the best songs i can. if i can get them good enough, then maybe that will help someone else hear just a glimpse of what may be possible, just the way i might have heard someone else before, even if it's just for 7 seconds coming out of a car window going around the corner"

        "question": "in a previous question someone theorised that the meaning of \"here comes the sun\" is \"having hope when everything seems horrible, because it'll get better eventually, giving you joy and love\" and you said \"pretty much\". what i'm wondering is if the message of \"here comes the sun\" (what was stated above) is something personal to you? perhaps from the time you wrote the song or when you chose to make it into a full music video or if it's just a more general message? (of course if it is something really personal you don't have to say)",
        "answer": "yes, but it also applies to absolutely everyone. even other animals and plants too. essentially anyone who has ever lived on our planet the message is something like \"ever had a bad time? well i have great news, the sun still exists and you will likely see it tomorrow morning\""

        "question": "I struggle between choosing to spend my time coming up with new ideas or finish existing ones that I started. I want to have a goal of 1 new musical idea per *reasonable amount of time*, but I don't know how to prioritize between investing time into new things when I have ideas outstanding that need attention. Do you have any suggestions/have you experienced this? thanks",
        "answer": "basically what i did, when i was first in your situation, is to just keep coming up with new ideas. let them pile up. This is probably because i may have had a fear of not having enough ideas. Then it rapidly became a problem. Another thing i began doing is writing songs entirely on paper, and i would demand to finish the whole thing in 1 session. That's one way of dealing with it. so i wrote more and more and more. Sometimes they wouldn't get finished, sometimes they would. Usually if it was shorter, it would get finished. but they all got put into the list regardless. more years went by with more writing like this. It was more rare that i would ever record any of them. Eventually when the problem became even more serious, i finally found a way to work on the existing ideas. This is a whole separate task from generating new ideas, and i still consider them separate. For a couple years i ONLY did 'middle writing', which is where i work on existing ideas. Then a few months later, as i was getting ready to start recording some of them, i did a few weeks of finishing, just finishing writing for songs. I could talk for years about the different systems i've used for SELECTING which ones to work on. And this is not even to discuss selections for the recording process, which you didn't ask about. Eventually as enough years go by, you start to feel your life running out, so you probably take drastic measures. Nowadays, for me this is how it works: new ideas can come any time, that's always true. Sometimes they even come in dreams. So i catch them whenever they arrive, and i don't really do a writing session at that time because it's usually not the right time. but you just try to catch as much as you can. That's totally separate from any writing process or work process. Separately from that, it is a linear process of working toward the item i am releasing next, and i work on that 1 item until it's done. For songs, first what i do, at the beginning of a project, i do a round of new song idea generation, but this is NOT necessarily promising that any of these will be the one that's used. This is just to ensure that i am giving myself a chance to generate new ideas, which might have a chance of getting picked. So i generate some new ideas, maybe 10 or 15. Sometimes i use various different methods, just to make sure i've given myself a chance to try various things. Then, when that's done, i do song 'selection', which is where i'm going to choose which one is going to be recorded, for the next release. This selection is made from the ENTIRE list, which includes the new ones but also includes all the other ones, which are all at various levels of completion (writing). Once a selection is made, then it's quite simple. I finish the writing all the way, first, then record it, all the way. then make the video, all the way. I should clarify that this procedure didn't become solidified until after many many many years of ambiguity which may be similar to what you are going through now"

Blah blah blah\" and they make these statements about the entirety of their work as if their songs need to be XYZ kind of way. It's like they want me to tell them that there's a RIGHT and a WRONG way to make a song good. And when I tell them that it sounds like they're asking for an acceptable formula, their eyes kind of glaze over. They say \"I don't want my songs to be formulaic! I just want to know the right way to write a song\" but in my mind those are the same thing. What I've told them is this - make up your own formula for an individual song. However you want the patterns to be and then fit your segments into the formula YOU create. I'm hoping at a minimum this will make t hem focu s more on their own instincts and less on right and wrong. But I can't tell. What do you think I should tell them?",

Just start at the beginning and see where it goes. i wrote a lot of songs that way. i guess you could call it 'chain writing', or 'train writing', because the whole thing is written in order. And it's all done on the chart, on paper. Then around 2011 i got envious of more 'normal' songs, so i finally learned how to be organized enough to work on songs at an instrument, find a chorus first maybe, learn how to write what's before the chorus, you know, normal stuff. So i did a lot of that during 2011. Near the beginning of 2012, however, there was a day where i fondly remembered the joy of 'chain writing' so i did some of those. and 'the road' is one of them. So it is likely that the contents of the song somehow reflects the context of that situation"

Is there any way i can try to play a specific melody in my head?",
        "answer": "write it down, and read it. if this seems too hard to do, this might be a cool opportunity to work on reading skills. This is exactly where reading is useful: to play something as planned. which i think is what you are talking about. There's still room for fluctuation within the chart, but the chart will do a wonderful job in keeping you on track, within the song you've meant to be playing"

        "question": "that I might be wrong) I'm gonna start from the most obvious part first I don't have enough time To say the things I wanna say To do the things I wanna do Or to be like you ---These 4 lines refer to how we are too busy to do the things we want, we aren't allowed to state our opinions freely, the line \"or to be like you\" may refer to how we compare ourselves to others I just want some time To express the things I feel Just to express the things I feel And believe them too --- This lines refers to how we often have our own opinions on some things, and we wanted to express them but can't. it also refers to cases where we d ebate wi th other people, and we started doubting our opinion and belives 2 + 2 has been 4 for So many darn years, oh Lord ---I think this refers to how we must live according to the rules created by society, while the \"oh lord\" part implies how we really want to break out from this cage I wanna write a song Oh, baby is that so wrong? ---I believe this refers to how we wanted to do something, but people would often try to stop us, even if the thing we're doing isn't bad I went down to the mall Then they closed down the mall Guess they don't want me going to the mall 'Cause I'm just too small ---This references on how sometimes people think we're to young to some stuff I just went online To explain the things I feel To express the things I mean And it f elt so real ---This refers to how we spent more time online than offline, and how our internet connection becomes more important Now I'm doing alright And I'm downright feeling okay It's the end of the world And I just can't wait --- Deppression? I know that you can relate ---Yes Then I built some trains And I'm travelling somewhere new It's a wonderful world, but Still no you It's a wonderful world for two ---This part describes our journey on finding happiness, we realize the world is beautiful, but we still can't find happiness (referenced by \"still no you\", you references happiness) And now for the main part, the la de da part And it goes La de da de da de da de day oh La de da de where did all the good times go? ( La de da de la da dee d um dom L a da de day When will you come back home? ---I believe that this part (and all the other la de da part) is referencing the idea of genuine happiness, happiness without reason. If we examine the lyrics, most of it consists of the word la de da de da, which really has no actual meaning (there's some explanation about the word \"la di da\" but I don't think Bill is referencing to that la di da) ---The tune (or the sound, music, I don't know what you actually call them) is a joyful expression. The la de da part sounds happy. Combine this with the meaningless of the lyrics, this means happiness without reason. ---Genuine happiness is actually rare this days. Yes, we often feel happy, like when we just won a game match, or we get a promotion at work, but that happiness is only temporary. If the condition changes (like we lose the next game, or someone accidentally hit our car when we're going home from work) we will no longer be happy ---Gen uine happiness, on the other hand, doesn't have a reason. it's being happy simply because we existed. It's a feeling of being grateful because we're still here, regardless on the situation. This is what we all wanted. The words \"When will you come back home\" expresses our search for this happiness, as we continue to wait for happiness to come to us. The lines Then I built some trains And I'm travelling somewhere new It's a wonderful world, but Still no you It's a wonderful world for two expresses our believes that if we have wealth, career, love, fame, or all those other things, we can be genuinely happy, but that isn't true. we don't need all of that. Genuine happiness is as simple as being happy, but we struggle to find that, like how we don't understand simple words like \"la de da de yo\" Just got home got no home La de da d-de where did it go? Oh no I can't go home. --- I believe this is an exp ression on how we believe that we don't have happiness, when it's really it's just there. Kinda like how Bill wrote \"Got no home\" While he, definitely, have a home. We believe we don't have happiness, while it's really just there, waiting us to come back home. What do you think about my analysis? DId I miss your point completely?",
        "answer": "that could be true. When i first wrote that, i was probably making an excuse for the song not being good enough. the original version of that was \"i don't have enough time to write the song i want to sing, so please don't judge me one little bit\". then, 2 years later, i re-wrote it with possibly slightly more experienced songwriting abilities for me this was just another extrapolation of my previous sentiment, because this part wasn't there in the original. it jumped straight to the 2+2 part after \"please don't judge me one little bit\" what i was probably thinking was, songwriting apparently has been possible for many many years, and the reason i think i know this is because a lot of songs exist i just wanted to write songs, and i couldn't really figure out why it was more difficult than i expected, considering the fact that i already had multiple decades of musical experience prior to that point, in addition to having written dozens of songs already, many years before that the 'too small' line is the worst line in the song. it is literally just a rhyme. horrible. i am against doing this. it breaks one of my best rules of songwriting, which is don't do that. The triple mall line(s), however, i stand behind. And it's basically my way of plowing fearlessly into the second verse. Think of it this way ........ i had just selected this song the day before, to be the next one that's recorded, and i was having major remorse about it (despite having been very diligent in the song selection). I really was feeling down about the whole thing, and i had already changed my mind about it and chose to do a much sadder and slower song instead. But then i was doubting that one just as much, so, i was actually at the barber and i was waiting for a hair cut, and i was trying to comprehend what went wrong in the song choice. So i came back to thinking about this 'la de da' song. At the time, the song was only written up until the end of the first chorus. so i guess i just briefly posed the question, 'what if i COULD do this one.... and what would the second verse most likely be, if i did it' and just as i was getting into the barber chair, the first 3 mall lines assaulted me right in the face. And i was immediately convinced that that seals the deal for the song choice, but that particular burst of writing went no further. and i was left to toil in the mud when i got home to try to complete the phrase. i made a bad decision, and i suppose i tried to mask it with background vocal arrangements i think, if you are talking about the last line, i think it is playing on the fact that the internet is real, while also using a phrase like \"it felt so real\" which is a phrase commonly associated with things that *might* not be real. so i was attempting to provide a little bit of intrigue there. Also one thing you forgot to mention was that i switched the words in the more common phrases 'explain the things i mean' and 'express the things i feel'. i switched the verbs, to see if it means something slightly different. turns out it does no, this is just meant to provide an alternate flavor of the line in the corresponding position in the verse before this. which you conveniently did not mention yet it seems to be fairly common for people to make casual conversation about the world being all wrong you mentioned this out of order, but this comes after the \"just too small\" line. Perhaps the 'built some trains', 'traveling somewhere new' was my way getaway scheme, to escape from the blandness of the previous line. Or just assuming the mall was not a viable option. it is a natural progression to take a train somewhere else.... but with 10,000 bonus points for building your own train. When the subject of 'traveling somewhere new' comes up, it becomes impossible not to mention how wonderful the world is. when you think of all the possible places you could go. But then, when realizing that, the NEXT thing to immediately realize is it would be nice to have some companionship as well. OR, there is also a double meaning to 'still no you' line, it could also mean the world IS \"no you\". like, it's still doesn't compare to you. That's just in case maybe you took a look around at the world and still think it's not as good as it could be. so in that case you would be singing TO something which you think could be even better than the world. So in that moment, the line seems to mean those 2 things. But when the next line hits ('wonderful world for 2') i think it becomes more clear that it actually meant the first thing the lines immediately before this were basically begging to write a song. we have already essentially looked in the mirror and stated the wish 3 times, pretty much there is nowhere else to go but to actually do it. \"La de da\" etc. would be a meta characterization of a song being written Well i think it's clear that there was a very strong previous desire to write a song, and it seems clear when the chorus hits that this is actually happening. So i think that is a pretty good reason THAT'S BECAUSE YOU CONVENIENTLY TOOK THE MELODY AWAY. LIKE FOR FOOD, DO YOU THINK A PLATE HAS MEANING i think the problem is you are blatantly ignoring all the meaning could be true i think it's really easy to understand if it's together with the melody, and, with the context of the previous part of the song basically what this is about is ending the song. I already tried 2 other endings which seemed more obvious, and they just weren't working for me. so i tried kicking it into a barren wasteland real quick, to see where it takes me. Much more interesting results, i thought about 30%. However, one of the most powerful things about music and songs is the ability to have multiple meanings. So the meanings you've found in it are certainly just as real, but, what seemed strange to me was when you tried to claim certain things were meaningless while you were clearly finding meaning in it. just seemed a little hypocritical"

        "question": "there seems to be a recurring pattern with your song lyrics in that many songs are about themselves. does \"moon cheese\" fit into this as well? maybe tasting represents achieving the song's full potential, if you were doubting yourself at the time.",
        "answer": "it probably does the whole point of that song, from the start, is the title. i was envious of other songs (probably country songs) which have a title which already has some cleverness baked right in. so i thought of one, \"the moon is made of cheese (but i can't taste it)\". so just went from there and tried to continue the game. you can't taste it, but you like the way the texture feels when you lick the surface. Makes perfect sense, but is also completely ridiculous. so the next line \"the rumors start to go round the world that i'm crazy\" well of course, because you're licking the moon. but no, instead, it's \"becaususe you can't taste the cheese\". so the fun score, for me, continues to be upheld up to that point. Next stanza, start with a line to echo the same theme as the first. famous phrase ('the grass is always green') then change it ('but i just changed it'). From this point, the key changes start to play an even more significant role, but, the game remains the same. i'm simply in search of quality songwriting"

        "answer": "keep a journal. this could be a long journey i pick an idea from the list if they weren't written together, then they probably are not part of the same song. i think if you try to put them together they may look like awkward surgery. So, pick 1, and then 'play doctor' with it. give it a diagnosis. Is it the beginning of the song? is it not the beginning of the song? is it a 'chorus'? is it not a chorus? What does this idea mean to you? try to remember everything about the circumstances of coming up with it. This should lead you to your next decision about what it needs. Another thing that i should mention about the way i do it, i always write the entire song all the way through before even touching the production process. I know that not everyone does it this way, but, i've found out, to play to my strengths it's important to remain as nimble as possible during the writing process, and that means not trying to actually produce it while writing. i am a 'write first' person, then produce what i wrote. Also another thing i should mention, i was in your situation (wanting to produce entire songs myself) and i knew i was qualified, because i had already been playing multiple instruments for at least 10 or 15 years before, so i thought it should be easy. but unfortunately it took me at least 10 MORE years after that before i really felt like i could comfortably get the entire job done. actually i'm still not really there yet. But who knows ..... maybe you will find a way to make things.... simpler"

To begin assembly, place the 5-star base upside down and insert casters into the bottom of base. Turn the base right side up on the floor and insert the cylinder into the center hole on the base. Place the telescoping cover over the the cylinder and rest it on the base. Attach the seat plate to the bottom of the seat cushion (with front of seat plate facing the front of the seat cushion) by using 15/8\" screws into the front holes of the seat plate and 7/8\" screws into the rear holes of the seat plate and tighten the screws. Align the back cushion with the seat cushion by positioning the back support plate over the seat plate with 11/4\" screws. Do not tighten the screws completely. Attach the arms respectively on each side onto the bottom of the seat cushion and the sides of back cushion by using 11/2\" screws. Tighten all the screws. Remember to tighten the screws on the back support plate. Place the plastic caps into the two arm holes on each arm. Place the assembled chair on top of the cylinder and press down until fully engaged. Periodically (every 90 days) make sure that the screws are still fully tightened."

        "answer": "you mentioned you were starting with chords then putting words to them. How about starting with words (AND a melody), then putting chords with that? But, you also mentioned that you don't feel too great with words yet. So for that, i would recommend opening up a text file and just start going bonkers day and night, not to write songs, but just do it as a way of life, until further notice. Really try to use the page to actually solve any problems in life you may have. after a couple years of doing that, i think you will find words to be quite a good playground to be on. Then if you decide to add music into that, then you'll be so powerful it's unfair"

        "question": "Were you good at writing assignments in school? Because I'm always too horrified to do them; like everybody just does them as if it's the same as putting together cars on an assembly line but I can't think of the assignments like that, like I can't write something unless I'm sure it's true and meaningful. I guess ideally, I should be able to do that in a timely manner but I just can't, or at least I'm too scared to try. And the classic advice I always get is to not care too much about writing something good, but it just hurts to meaninglessly write for the sake of writing, like what's the point of being a human if you can't create anything with significance? Also it's not like the work that everyone else produces is shitty, it's actually very good which means that if I take the assembly-line approach, not only will the act of it feel horrible, but its product will be worse than what everyone else is somehow able to create with the same method. I dunno, I guess I'm asking this because you're definitely someone who makes meaningful content and well, you normally turn it out on a regular basis, so maybe you have some advice on how to accomplish this and perhaps on how you were able to these assignments back when you were in school. Thanks for reading this, I'm sorry if most of it is just a rant.",
        "answer": "clearly you are a writer, as seen above. I think it's worth looking into re-negotiating your contract with your producer (the one giving you the assignments). Make sure you both understand each other's goals in this, and then evaluate if you would both like to keep working with each other"

        "question": "Do you use traditional classical music theory or jazz theory? Have you come up with your own system? If so, how does it work?",
        "answer": "which is the one where you get to have notes and chords etc yes but, it is close cousins with the system generally used on the 'Earth' planet, over the course of the past 300 years or so eternally mysterious as music remains to this day, one thing i'm sure of is: the core principle seems to be about 'making patterns and breaking them'. This seems to apply to more than just music. But, what music adds to this, in addition, is pitches, which clearly have some nice relationships, which help to enrich the pattern making/breaking process to a level that is so deeply subliminal i feel you could spend 1000 lifetimes trying to figure out exactly how the heck it actually works. But, again, what i will say is, regardless of what seems 'known' or 'unknown', or 'right' or 'wrong', it becomes unnecessary to choose between the two, because what seems to always power the whole thing is this 'making patterns and breaking them' phenomenon. so given that, finding what's \"right\" and \"wrong\" becomes an ellusive chase which never yields a static answer. you just have to keep playing the game. which also happens to be very serious"

        "answer": "coming up with these things is like lightning striking. You can't really guarantee that it happens, but, i can tell you everything i know so far about this. 1. it's most likely to happen when you run through the song, from the beginning, at the right tempo, without stopping 2. it gets more and more likely for it to happen the longer time it's been since you've heard the song. 3. this is unfortunate, because it's very time consuming to keep waiting until you haven't heard the song in a while, every time you hear it 4. try walking to the door of the room you are in, touching the door handle, and then returning to the instrument (or demo-recording you are working with) and do a run through. this may be an artificial way to help 'reset' if you don't have time to wait 5. if you're just not getting it, try to make categories of things, and try to rule them out. 6. for example, try continuing it to be the same as what came before. Hopefully you will get a strong signal \"yes\" or \"no\" from trying this. then you can rule that out, or in 7. try going to the most normal chord you haven't used yet. for example, if your verse is full of C and F chords, try G and see what happens 8. try something with dense melody/lyric (wordy). hopefully that will give you a strong 'yes' or 'no' signal 9. try something with very few words. see if you can rule that out or in 10. keep trying to categorically prove or dis-prove that a certain strategy is right or wrong 11. i forgot the most important thing which i should have said first, imagine a scene where your song takes place. then name something that could happen next. i should have mentioned this one first because it's probably the one that's most likely to work"

        "question": "After listening many many times I've started noticing that the part that enjoy and makes me smile the most in \"Here comes the Sun\" is the part after \"I can't explain the way I'm feeling\" where you start mumbling the melody, and I was quite surprised by that fact because as a songwriter I always thought writing something meaningful brought out more emotions into a song. Do you think sometimes saying nothing can bring more emotions then actually saying something, do you think it can make the qualities of a song shine more and did you intend for that part to make someone feel that way or was it just a coincidence.",
        "answer": "right. it does mean something. i've started the section with an instrumental riff, (no words), then jumped into lyric saying \"and i can't explain the way that i'm feeling\", which correlates together because i've done a wordless riff, then justifying that by saying \"and i can't explain\", so we've essentially established that we're blending the lyric and non-lyric, while the lyrics are actually referencing this. Then the next 2 lines (which are the ones you are talking about) are entirely in context with this, as we sing another lyricless melody and then explain that we're 'putting it into words', while also doing just that (putting it into words). Also, in addition, the line after that is \"send it all over the world\" which if you do not think has meaning i would be glad to spend every day of my life in court with you to explain that it does. Also the first thing you said was that this section makes you smile a lot, so i would be curious to know in what world is happiness not meaningful my songs are actually created by a random noise generator. that's why they sound like a steady hiss. any resemblence to the sound of words or music would be a huge coincidence"

But, i now firmly believe that all programs need to be scriptable, so that if you do choose to have a million keyboards, you can make use of them, and customize your workflow yes i know. i really need to switch to it. unfortunately there's never a good time to put the production schedule on pause for several more months. in the meantime, if anyone out there is in the mood to help me find some commands (from xraym's resources, probably) that would be helpful. Here's a major one: how to select the midi note nearest to the playhead, regardless of what track it's on, and play the sound of that note. then another script to travel to the next midi note forward in time, regardless of track, and play the sound of that one. Then another script to select the track of that note, and open the midi editor, with that note selected, and visible on the screen with a reasonable zoom range"

        "answer": "it's sort of like when you are in a room, and you want to go to the next room. and there appears to be a door going between them. the first thing to try, might be to go through that door. that's sort of an example of what i might consider reasonable.

        "question": "Hey, Bill. So, I've reached that point in life in which I should know where I'm heading for, but I don't. I'm seventeen and apparently yesterday I couldn't choose what I'd have for lunch, but today I'm supposed to decide what to do for the rest of my life? And I've had this idea in the back of my mind for years, but I feel like I used to be scared of not knowing what to do and now I'm just kinda scared of knowing I don't want to do anything. Growing up, I've developed real interst in mathematics and languages, and I always thought I'd do something related to one of these areas. But now that I actually have to choose, I don't want either. I live in a developing country and everything is focused in applicability: maths and languages courses are too much about applied knowledge, never seen as pure areas of study. The reason why I fell in love with maths and languages in the first place was by overanalyzing things that have no real impact in the world: I liked that they were beautiful on their own, with no need to ever be used. And the prospects for me are really negative from this point on, because I feel like every college I go to and every job available for me will be quite the opposite of that. I wish I lived in the US or Europe where pure sciences actually exist, but I don't, and I can't afford to go these places. I feel like there's nothing I want to do with the rest of my life, and yet my parents say I have to choose soon because I gotta make money somehow. Anyway, I know this completely out of the scope of this page, I just really needed someone to talk to. I guess my question is \"what should I do given that I'm a broken piece in the machine of human existence and don't seem to have any use to anyone or be able to perform any useful service to humanity, however small?\"",
        "answer": "there's no reason you should have to do that today. You may have known some of it since you were 6, and you may not find some of it until you are 96 you don't have to choose. those are both cool things, and they are allowed to be in your life, as much or little as you want i think you will still get a chance to do many things with your life, besides the things you do for employment. Sure, make some decisions on that now, but just make the best decision you can, based on the information you have. even if if you don't have all the information. Because you are obviously still missing at least half of the information. most people are. but you will find a lot of that information along the way. And either one you choose, you'll probably learn something. and also keep in mind that some of the most powerful things to be learned, may come from outside the 'curriculum' just taking a quick glance at the big picture here, just on the page here, it appears you seem to have some writing skills. which i can guarantee is a useful skill, in many many ways, and is still alive and thriving especially now in the internet age"

        "question": "um okay so hi person I look up to quite a bit idk if you'll see this but I kinda need some life advice and I don't know who else I can talk to but uhhh: I've always known that I am the kind of person who HAS to be producing some kind of creative output, whether it's something like art or dancing or getting a job... like I just kind of have to DO something with my life you know?? the problem is that I'm not skilled in any sort of particular area and I know that I need to pick something to do and then stick to it but I just don't know what??? I consume and consume all the sights and events and media around me and I have all of these thoughts and desire to do SOMETHING but I can't figure out what to channel it into. Once I figure out what I should be doing I know I'll put my blood, sweat, and tears into it but I just can't find a starting point. I'm also at the age where I need to start planning what to do with my life and how to make money and shit but I just disappoint everyone who wants things from me because I can't stay motivated because I just don't have a PURPOSE. I just wish I had something I could be proud of and that I could be respected or respect myself for, something I poured all this energy I have inside me into, something that I can die with satisfaction knowing that I did. I don't even know what kind of advice you could give me lol, but honestly if you have any thoughts or anything at all it would be really cool :)",
        "answer": "wait, that's not true. One of the coolest things about our universe is the way things can change yes, this is good. you are getting charged up. You will probably experience some high passions and maybe a lot of envy and jealous rage, at this time. jealous of the people whose content you are consuming, because you really would like to be the one creating the content. At least that has been my experience that's every age with the amount of passion you have already demonstrated, you are going to find this in copious quantities, throughout your life. When in this moment it may seem like these 'purposes' are in 0 places, pretty soon you will find them in infinite places. infinity has a weird tendency to look like 0 sometimes. i think the first step is to be aware of this fact (at least it was for me). which is to realize that massive possibilities and potential exists literally everywhere, in everything. For me, i've dedicated my life to proving this, but before i felt like i had done it, i was always searching for any time i felt like someone else had proved it, and latch onto that and study it and use it as proof that it can be done. I feel i should probably stop telling everyone to \"write\" a lot, because maybe some people just don't enjoy witing. But .... for you, it seems like you are perfectly comfartable writing, as you've just demonstrated. So i think you should find your most comfortable writing tool (a text editor on a computer, wherever you are most comfortable writing/typing), and just start.... USING it. Do anything you can in it. Use it to be honest. Use it to paint pictures. i don't care what you use it for, .... anywhere between honesty and art, fiction to diagrams, .... i mean, just test the keyboard, to start out with. Make sure every key is working. This will be one of the simplest ways to get your brain to start putting things into the world. Basically what we need to do is open up these pathways so your brain can start communicating with the world and putting things out there. you've demonstrated clearly that you are in the sort of 'consuming' stage, with some pent up desire to be the one on the other end of that. Maybe watch some film directors interviews on youtube. That could be a starting place. You might not want to direct films, but it might remind you of something else you do want to do. But another thing i should remind you, finding these things is like a river. You just make your best guess and do a thing, and then along the way you will hear some signals that will give you another hint of what you should try next. Trust me, these rivers ALWAYS get to huge dank oceans, eventually, if you let them flow. And you have made it clear that you have a huge amount of water to start with"

Take the world map you're using (probably an equirectangular, 1 by 2 rectangle), and make a second map, with everything blacked out except your desired region. Then, swap in that map to the globe, then re-render the exact same clip, with the exact same camera movement, in the exact same time range. Then, when you import those clips to your 2D program, put the region/black map on top. then key out the black. then fuck the colors as desired"

        "question": "hey bill, I really like your videos and they really help me lift my mood up after a bad day. I am still figuring out my life since I'm quite young and I'm not exactly sure what my talents are. Seeing you make videos in your own style inspires me a lot. If you don't mind, could you give me some advice on how to figure out what I'm good at? Also when did you realise that making songs and videos was your thing? I'm not sure if you'll see this but I just wanted to thank you :)",
        "answer": "you just have to start doing some different things after many years of being mostly a drummer (and partially a keyboard player), but just wanting MORE, and then gradually trying to figure out what i want to put in songs, spent many many years doing that, then spent many more years writing a lot of songs, then spent many more years trying to figure out how to actually record all the parts myself in a way that i felt would be good enough, then finally i realized i still wanted MORE so i tried to figure out how to make videos. Then i made videos for several years then decided i still wanted much much more, so i tried to revolutionize the video making, and i'm still kind of trying to do that, but i also still want MORE videos, so that means i have to sort of revolutionize things in a slightly different way, and still in addition to all of that i still want MORE types of videos that i haven't made yet but i've written some of them. As you can see i'm a fairly greedy person"

        "question": "hi bill. when making music, making ideas and stuff comes easy but when I try to revise them I just never get it done. my teacher and my parents push me to revise my works, but it's hard to find motivation. any thoughts? (btw you're amazing)",
        "answer": "the risk in 'revising' is that it might make it worse and less genuine. The benefit, however, is that it might make it more coherent. I spent a long time being unable or afraid to do this. i just kept writing new things. but eventually i just got so jealous of 'normal' songs, for having a repeating chorus, etc, that i figured it out. Half of the struggle, i think, is just choosing which item you're going to work on. for me it was necessary to first gather all the items into a list. Then i would go through the list one at a time, and make a few moves on each one. the 'diagnosis' is important. Play through the existing material, get a first impression, see if you generally like it or if it sucks, .... then start diagnosing it. If it's a small idea, figure out if it's the beginning or not the beginning. If it's already a long / complete idea, just go through from the beginning and find the first place where it truly sucks or is not good enough. This point is what i call the 'split point', the point where the existing material stops being good enough. So you put the rest aside, and write from there. I generally don't think it's good to plan on writing to connect to what comes after -- very risky and strange to do this. But it might happen automatically. so you can be open to that, but, plan on just writing from the split point and doing what's truly right from the split point"

Just kidding, my name's not Steve.\" But at the end of the video, you (he) say, \"Bye, I'm Steve.\" (I am sorry for this retelling, obviously you already know this.) This contradicts with what you (he) said in the beginning of the video. So is he Steve? Is he not Steve? If he is not Steve, is there any chance his name is Jed? Or is he a representation of you?",

        "answer": "i write the melody, which usually makes the chords obvious. it's like when you put a car in a room: and then it becomes pretty clear which room it is (garage). so almost never is a 'chord progression' written. i just write the song, and use what chords i need neither. i have to calm myself and just try to let the song play, in my mind (before it exists). then, if that goes well, i write down how it went"

        "answer": "first, just sit yourself down (or stand up) and ask yourself if you truly want the views. If the answer is yes, (it certainly was for me), there is a 2-part strategy i can recommend. first, keep doing the content, regularly and ruthlessly, to the absolute greatest of your ability. then, (or at the same time), open up some social media accounts in your artist name and begin GENTLY but ruthlessly interacting with many many many people, in the most honest and genuine way you can. i should clarify that this strategy is tailored toward the person who's answer to the first question was a resounding 'yes', mostly because it takes a long long time to do it effectively. but it does work"

        "question": "I saw an answer to one of the questions about your having finished the audio for the latest project you're working on. Out of curiosity, why not release audio tracks without videos at this point? And, for the top super star songs that you have, just release only those with videos? It looks like writing, arranging, and recording are pretty fast for you--just bums me out to not hear new music you have been making just to wait for the video. Imagine if the release of your large catalog was held up by the creation of videos. The songs mean so much more to me.",
        "answer": "greed, i think perhaps this is a psychological problem i have, but, i try to make all my songs top super star songs. it always seems like a bad career move to ever deliberately make one that is not i know, me too. except for me it's harder than waiting, because i have to do all the work also. combine that with the guilt of knowing you have to wait i feel the same way. negotiations have been underway day and night to rectify this exact issue"

        "answer": "sometimes you can get magical results by combining 2 different ones. sometimes the results are even more magical if you sort of only play half the chord with one of the instruments. The trick is to just pick an instrument you have, then, go through the entire song and very carefully and inquisitively just sort of test the waters to see where you can get a word (note) in. i call this the sprinkle method, which has its advantages and disadvantages, but, the advantage is that sometimes the natural blending effect makes it sound like you have more magical instruments than you really have"

Usually i will also let the recordings run while i am trying to come up with the ideas, just to make sure i catch anything i come up with. then when i think i'm sure, then i'll jump to the next recording and demo it concisely and that will be the recording that is referenced in the lyric sheet. then of course when it's all done, do a timed run through on a click, where you might miss a couple of lyrics but the important thing is to see the proper road map, then, you can also have a more detailed one, where you may stop and clarify whatever you need"

The answer to these questions will determine what each of your hands should be doing. and then there are different strategies depending on how many jobs you have to do. In some cases, maybe your hands only have 1 job, in which case it's not a bad idea to put 1 hand behind your back"

        "question": "(serious) im doing bad in school. This isnt because of me though, it is because of the situation im in. Before the pandemic, i was in AP classes and was one of the smarter students in the class, but as soon as i started home school, my grades dropped to Cs. I want to succeed and learn. I love learning but my teachers cant teach us when we are home the same way. Id learn one thing maybe every week for every teacher but i would learn nothing for like a week after. This isnt motivation enough to want to make me keep my grades up. Why would i care to keep my grades up when im learning pretty much nothing and my teachers don't motivate me. So to summarize, i used to be a good student, then when covid hit, my grades dropped to shit and i cant find motivation to keep them up. I want to have a good GPA but even when i do really try, i end up flunking tests or essays. Do you have any advice on this?",

        "answer": "here's the one thing to realize about music (or art) which might make this whole puzzle start to make sense. it's a magic trick. it's a miracle. it's weird and strange, and the more the scientists try to figure out what the \"right\" answer is, the damn music will change again and find a new way to knock your socks off even more. So, knowing the paradoxical and mischievous nature of this, it's probably time to start looking at the other side of the coin here, and instead of trying to find something that's actually \"right\", try doing something \"wrong\" on purpose. you might be surprised by the results"

If you feel like you must finish it, you can also do that but you just need to be very patient and calm and sit with it, and don't be alarmed if you are too tense to get anything for several hours. if you are patient, it will come, i'm sure. it literally can't stay away forever. science tells us this"

What you can do, when working while you're awake, is just be patient, and know that sometimes nothing happens for a long time until you can finally get truly comfortable. in a way, it only works if you stop wanting it to work. And this can be quite difficult, especially if you want the music as much as i do. but if you're patient, it HAS to happen eventually. science tells us this"

        "answer": "i just have to try it and see. it generally tends to be a good strategy to not have too many different things happening at exactly the same time. sort of like in conversation. but sometimes some overlap does work. you just have to try and see"

Have they rusted and fallen into decay? Could be that it's just a feeling of looking away and then back and recognizing that you never paid attention to the things right in front of you, because otherwise you'd know the speed. Or maybe the speed hasn't changed, but in youth everything looks bigger, faster, more vibrant and full of life and character.

        "question": "At the beginning of your most recent song, \"got some money\", when you say \"and I wonder if I'm sad about the money that I have, what is the music there. Is there any name for it. Where it gets lower and lower and with the little bit at the end. I also have a similar question for the line \"and it makes me mad\", which is about 35 seconds in. Same thing, what is the term for the music happening there. With emphasis on 'me mad'. That's all.",
        "answer": "the best names i have for it is just the names of all the notes and chords. the notes are E, D#, C#, C in the melody. then i think you probably want to put the bass with it on the same notes, for beef, except on \"have\", i am definitely using a chord known as G#dominant7, and the important part of that chord in this case will be: you want the C note (melody) then you also want the F# note with that, somewhere in the harmony, and then you'd have G# in the bass. And i can't remember if i put the bass in G# (root of the chord) or C (with the melody), let me listen and check. ok yes the bass is on G#. Also i've harmonized the melody a 3rd above, so \"money that i\" will also have notes G#, F#, E, and then it seems for \"have\", instead of harmonizing a 3rd above, for that one i've used F# as the harmony note, as i said, to get the best results on that chord you need the F# and C notes to give it that twang. with the G# in the bass. again, i can just tell you the notes. there's hardly any chords in here, except \"mad\". the bass is just wandering toward the important note (the \"mad\" chord), and the chord for mad could be pretty much described as D7 (D dominant7), and in this case, to get the sound you want there, really all you want is the note F# (in the melody), you want C also in the harmony, and you want D in the bass. that should do the trick"

        "answer": "throw yourself into a professional working band as soon as possible. But, in case it is a disease year, here's something else i can recommend: take your favorite songs, and delete the bass. This is pretty easy to do if you have a phone, tablet, or laptop. just play it without any headphones, and it automatically deletes the bass. then, make sure your bass IS plugged into something that is large so you can actually hear it (like an amp) and play along. Generally what i'm trying to say, get yourself into a situation where you are actually playing the bass role in songs, as soon as possible. that's pretty much where you are going to learn everything. Start out by just playing the root note of each chord (for example, if the chord is C, play the C note). Try to hold back from doing anything else just yet. but then pretty soon, as if by magic, you're automatically going to start doing everything you need to do and have a wild time"

        "question": "this isnt actually a question but i wanted to say that i really really liked the video for got some money. the minimalist aesthetic is sick, and while its obviously very different from the visual spectacles that were i'm a princess/here comes the sun, its got a charm of its own and it kept me just as engaged watching as any of ur other videos. i especially liked the part where u represented the sea with a bunch of wavy slashes, that was awesome and reminded me of some sort of DOS game (thats a compliment, DOS games are cool). plus, i honestly think i prefer the blend of 2d and 3d to pure 3d... it makes the 3d parts feel more special. i hope u don't abandon this new style just bc its not as eye popping as ur other stuff - i do love ur cool big videos, but more than anything i love ur music, and it seems like this style lets u make videos for said music way faster. anyway sorry for posting feedback on ur questions page. to make up for it heres a question: when you sing \"i said it three or for songs ago\" what are u referring to?",
        "answer": "the visual minimalism has so many life-changing implications for me, it's hard to ignore. it just depends on whether i have the cojones to release things like that. and the key word is cojones i'm trying to make you think. get those gears turning"

        "question": "how do you prime factor 1021",
        "answer": "see if the digits add up to 3, which they don't, then check for 7, so ditch the 21 and see if the 10 is a multiple of 7 which it's not, then check for 11 by subtracting it from 1021 which makes 101 (after you drop the zero at the end) and check if 101 is a multiple of 11 which you should know it's not because 101 is prime, then check for 13 by adding 39 to 1021 which makes 106 (after you drop the zero at the end) then divide by 2 to get 53 and check if that's a multiple of 13 which of course it's not because it's neighbor 52 already is, then check 17 by eliminating the 102 from the left of 1021 and you're left with 1 which is not a multiple of 17, then check 19 by adding it to 1021 and you get 104 (after dropping the zero at the end) and you probably already know 104 is not a multiple of 19 (divide it by 2 a few times and you'll just get to 13), then check 23 by adding 69 to 1021 to get 109 (after you drop the zero) which is prime so 23 is out, then check 29 by adding it to 1021 which makes 105 (after you drop the zero) which you might already know as just 7x15 so no 29s there, then you can check 31 by subtracting it from 1021 which makes 99 (after you drop the zero) and we all know that 99 is just 11x9 (without any 31s in it), then you can check 37 except i THINK we're already done because i think 37 squared is already higher than 1021 because 32 squared is 1024 (famously) so 37 squared can't be any lower than that. and if 37 squared is higher than 1021, then that means we're never gonna find any other prime factors higher than that, because, if we did, their partner factor would have to be something lower and we checked everything lower already, so 1021 is prime, so your answer is an earth shattering 1x1021"

You're one of my favorite artists of all time and I rank you up at the top in my list of favorites, along with the Beatles, Steely Dan, and the Beach Boys. I'm also grateful that you offer a place to share your knowledge and humor with your fans - it's a very unique opportunity to talk directly with someone who inspires you. okay enough yammering here's my question: When writing your songs, are you usually putting words to music or putting music to words? I ask because I see you also used to do instrumentals. I'm woefully bad at lyrics, and a lot of the time I'm not even compelled to write them, because I stubbornly believe maybe the music I create will convey the emotions I'm trying to express on its own. Do you make your music with an emotion/other goal in mind and then write lyrics to m atch it, or do you write your lyrics and then write music to match? If you do both, have you found that your final products tend to be different depending on your method, and in what way(s)? Thanks in advance so much for answering!",
        "answer": "holy smokes you are very friendly for best results, i have to come up with the words and music at the same time. they rely on each other so much, i'm almost asking for trouble if i try to do it separately"

        "question": "if you could choose a month to celebrate a new year (disregarding when the earth finishes a revolution or the fact that different parts of the world experience different seasons), which month would you choose? personally, i sort of hate the fact that the new year starts 1/3 of the way into winter for where i live. do you think that celebrating a new year amid the austerity of winter contributes to some people giving up on their goals for the new year? do the seasons affect your motivation/mood? and do you find it helpful to observe days that signify change (new years, birthdays, etc) to make changes in your own life?",
        "answer": "if i'm celebrating a year, then i think it would be best to celebrate it for a year (not a month) i think the fact that 'new years' is known as 1 day, and not a year, is the reason people's 'new years' goals don't last much longer than a day the best part is when they change. which fortunately is always i prefer to observe the change when the actual life changes happen. which is not always easy to predict"

I barely know any music theory but the stuff I improvised actually sounded pretty good.

When I try to actually write a song on purpose it is no good. Is this normal? Please advise me",
        "answer": "it must not have been completely random, because you already said it was good yes music/art follows ridiculous rules. no scientist alive today can figure out exactly 'what' even is 'good' exactly. a huge amount of reverse psychology is at play. that's why it makes sense to me when you say you can't do it when you try, and you can do it when you don't try. sure, i can say \"don't try\", but that's easier said than done, especially if you really want it. but i think if you can accept the fact that it will come, you just don't know when, then you can feel ok waiting for it. get comfortable with the notes, while you are waiting. kind of like getting yourself comfortable in a waiting room chair"

        "question": "when you said you could see that 262147 didn't have a 7 in its factorization, how did you know that? since there is no easy rule for divisibility by 7",
        "answer": "you can legally knock off the 7 from the right side. and it still will or won't be divisible by 7. do you see what i mean? so, imagine if you could make legal moves like this, until eventually you got it down to something you could recognize. So you can knock the 7 off. then you still have a 14 on the end. so obviously you can subtract 14 and you'll still be left with the same status of 7-ness (or non.) Then you're left with 262, and of course you can divide it all you want and that won't change the 7-ness either. so go ahead and divide it by 2, which is super easy, digitally. just halve the digits and it's 131. Ok so i already know that one is prime just because i know my primes up to at least there. but if you didn't know 131, you can of course subtract 21 (again, that won't change the 7-ness of the main number). so that brings you to 110 and you can drop the zero (again, dividing (by 10) won't change its 7-ness). so you drop the zero and it's 11, and please tell me you can tell by looking at it if 11 is divisible by 7 (it's not). so the original number couldn't have been, because we've only made legal moves up to here"

        "question": "Why did you decide to stop working on i'm a princess at one point and start here comes the sun?",
        "answer": "i did a heck of a lot in between. i stopped working on i'm a princess because the world of 3D was so vast and overwhelming and i was so in love with it, i needed to get as deep as i could into it, which also requires some significant renovations, and i also got really into those too. Then finally when i had hit rock bottom and needed to pretty much 'make a video or die', i think i decided i wanted to start fresh, with something a little more straightforward. although in retrospect, 'princess' would have been pretty good there. but the other technical reason is because the video was already like 20% made in the old system, and i was certainly in no mood to go back to the old system, and yet i still desperately wanted to use the footage, because it was very sentimental to me, because it literally shows the moment where i fell in love with 3D. So i knew it was going to be somewhat of an odd case, a frankenstein project, that would have to be pieced together cleverly to combine old and new. a bit too complicated of an endeavor for me to attempt in the first go. in addition it obviously required character animation, for continuity purposes, which actually i was quite ready for because i developed most of that in early 2020. but i still wasn't ready for it yet. i tried a cameo in the 'sun' song to prepare"

        "answer": "i had already done a huge amount of music. i wanted it to sound like that, except better. for the videos, generally what i've always wanted my videos to look like is to be able to see every part of the world from some very cool and warm angles. although i've always known it's gonna be a long time before i'm capable of anything like that. so i'd have to settle for putting words on the page at warm/cool angles instead sure"

        "answer": "the lyrics and music are so closely linked, that quite often a lyric change means you have to change the music also. occasionally in some rare cases there might be a seamless lyric change, but that would usually only be for a word or two. Also, any significant change anywhere in the song will almost certainly have a ripple effect and everything after it would need to be changed also. it's kind of like when you change one thing in the present, and then the whole future changes"

As for whether you think it's necessary to still include another E note in the midrange part of the chord, that's up to you. it can be nice to put the E in the bass and actually just play C and G in the midrange of the chord. that's a pretty nice sound that is found readily all over all types of music you've heard. you'll have to check to see which seems to sound better at that point in the song you're playing, and on the instrument you're using. If the arranger has a specific preference, then they're gonna have to tell you directly or else write out the notes in the chart"

I the jingle i made was \"hello, i'm a piece of garbage\" (not the one you are referring to), which seemed appropriate. Then, maybe a couple of selections later, just by chance, i got one from the next day immediately after that (also in the summer of 2007). And it had exactly the same sort of affliction. So i really wasn't sure what to do, because it seemed like i had already done this one. But, so often, honesty is the best answer to things, so i framed the jingle as a sequel to the previous one, doing essentially the same thing"

If i were writing it on a chart for myself personally, i would say F2#4, and i know maybe that means 5 is allowed when it's not there, but, seeing that i would probably get that i'm supposed to focus on the 2 and #4. And also, if the next chord is F, then i think as a reader i'd easily pick up on the movement that's implied. As you can see, charts can be a lot of approximation and guessing games.

        "question": "hi bill, i've written a few songs, but i want to be able to write short 'jingles' like you do. how do you come up with those short but memorable melodies? do you just sing/play random notes, or whichever notes you feel will sound good by intuition? or do you apply some theory of which scale degree you want the melody to go to next? my guess is that you probably use a mix of the two, because that's how i write my songs too. but are there any specific tips you have just for writing these short jingles? sorry for the long and winding question",
        "answer": "i'm surprised you are ok with the longer stuff but not the shorter stuff. i would think shorter stuff would be a starting point if you can't do long stuff yet no yes, that's it the only theories that i consider valid are the ones that are based on the way the notes actually sound. although this may be an unpopular opinion you just have to magically think of them, just the same way you can magically think of the words you use when you talk. i don't know exactly how we do that, but i know that you get better the more you familiarize yourself with the playing field. so, for language, we just spend a lot of years in the world listening to people talk and trying to do it ourselves. for music, you can spend a lot of years listening to music and playing around with your favorite instruments. Also, because songwriting involves language, it can be helpful to spend a lot of time free-writing"

        "question": "So how come you made the chorus for \"la de da de da de da de day oh\" in 2010, but the rest of the song way later? Did you just read through your old notes and went \"this is pretty darn good, I can use this\"? And did you do the same for here comes the sun?",
        "answer": "i did not, that part was made in 2012. the verse before it was made in 2010 it's like a much much more meticulous and complicated version of that. i can write much faster than i can produce, so from 2008 to 2012 there was sort of a writing epidemic going on, where i just kept writing and writing and writing. not necessarily even finishing them. so in september 2012 i started gathering a chronological list of every song or partial song i had ever written, and then i started working little bits on each one. the same list continues to this day. So when it's time to record/produce and song/video, i have an elaborate writing/selection process where i write some brand new things first, add them to the list, then go through the entire list, pick out good candidates for the next production (i usually end up choosing about 25), then i do some additional writing on some of those, then finally i make my final selection. Then i continue writing that one to completion. The idea of casually finding a song, and just thinking 'oh this is good so i'll do it' seems hilarious to me. that's just not how it works. my mind has to go to full scale war with itself to settle on a song selection"

If the words rhyme too well then i think as a listener i would get the sense that the writer doesn't even care what the words mean.

But now I'm in a predicament with the second verse. Now I'm kind of back to trying to puzzle piece lyrics into the preexisting verse melody. I've tried to come up with a new melody/lyrics but then it seems too unrelated to the beginning. So what's the technique for getting around this/ what do you do to help with writing second verses are things like them? Thank so much!!",

Also the time when you're gonna get the right answer is gonna be after you've heard the whole thing through from the beginning up to the stopping point, in real time. what i would recommend is, record a run-through of what you have, then play some sort of calming sound-free game whilst listening to the recording. and don't be alarmed if you don't seem to get ANYTHING. you'll just have to wait a little longer until your brain actually calms down and until you actually are not thinking about it. then, plentiful answers will flow like water. then the race is on to catch them all in time"

        "answer": "i am guessing it's not working properly. if it's doing what it's supposed to, it should even out the volume. it might be just making everything louder, because the settings might not be right for your mix and you might just be hearing the 'make up gain' by default, which would just make it louder and not do anything. (this is what happened to me in the early stages). what i would suggest is to make sure there is no make up gain, then make sure the ratio is not 1:1 (make sure the first number is higher), then raise the threshold all the way up. Now it should be doing exactly nothing. then press the bypass button on and off to compare, and it should sound exactly the same. Also check to see if there is a 'reduction' monitor so you can see when it's actually doing something. So now it should be doing nothing. Now, with the bypass off (so the compressor is ON), start gradually lowering the threshold until you start to see the 'reduction' meter gradually start to light up when it hits those loud parts, and it should be tapering them down. then once you've compressed it down a little then you can raise the make up gain"

But if that's what you're used to, then that's ok. i'm just guessing that our arabic numberals (1,2,3,4 etc) might be more familiar to you (they certainly are for me). in any case, i would say you should just start going through all the songs you know and working out the chords for them, in any way you can (besides looking them up on the internet, only because that will probably get you the wrong chords), and then over time you will get really really good at it, and start to notice some patterns, then you will see all those patterns break, then if you can keep your head together you will probably start to notice patterns in how the patterns break, then of course you will see those patterns break as well, and then, somewhere around here, it's your turn"

        "question": "how do you find/make all of the cool instruments in your music? i have a hard time finding good instruments to use.",
        "answer": "here's a good trick i use: shorten the release and the attack. most sounds you will find, to start off, are a total mess, with a really long attack and release. probably meant for someone who doesn't really play the keyboard that much and just wants to achieve success by holding down 1 note. But when i shorten up the attack and release, then that very quickly turns it into something that is delightful for me to play, as a keyboard player. Another thing you can do is program in something on one of the wheel controls. my 2 favorite options for this are filter cutoff (wawawawaw), and vibrato. To do a nice vibrato the way i like, set the LFO to somewhere around 4x per second, then make the LFO control the pitch up and down, then, set the wheel to increase the depth of the LFO as you push the wheel up. If you have things on the wheels then i think you're gonna have a lot of fun and be able to express yourself really well"

And the other thing you can do is discuss the specific procedure. If you are hitting a wall, it often means that you don't actually know exactly what you are supposed to do next. sometimes you think you know, but you don't actually know, and this can be a reason for things being slow. discussing things usually helps a lot"

How long did it take you to get your voice to something you're comfortable singing with, how did you train it (if you did) and how many tries on average does it take to sing your songs? Thank you, keep up the amazing work man.",
        "answer": "holy smokes you are very friendly maybe 10 years by improvising a lot, or singing cover songs at the keyboard but then ditching into an improv almost immediately. also by recording vocal tracks to my own compositions i try each word about 20 to 50 times"

After about 100 more songs, you probably won't even have to listen to the song, you will be able to do it from memory. after about 1000 songs, you will probably be able to hear someone singing the melody for a song you have never heard before, without hearing the chords, and figure out what the chords should be. after 10,000 songs, you should be able to play chords along with them on the first try, never having heard the song before, and have them think you already knew the song"

        "question": "can you explain what the chords are for the song I like? I think it's really catchy and I would like to learn the song, but I can't figure out the chords. Thanks!",
        "answer": "i have good news and bad news. The good news is, i have the original chart of when i wrote it, all on paper, years before i ever recorded it. The bad news is, it's not guaranteed to be entirely accurate because when i record a song, i am potentially allowed to invoke the 'suck' clause and change some of the details IF i thought it sucked. but the good news is, i'm looking at the chart right now and it seems extremely accurate. the bad news is that the end was re-written (not shown on this chart) but the good news is that the new ending is only 4 bars, in replacement of 27 bars on the chart, and those new 4 bars, if they were written in this chart language, would not have shown any chords, it would be notated as rap only, in a similar notation language to the 27 bar ending you do see. so you wouldn't have seen any chords from the chart there anyway. The bad news of course, is that for sections like that, in this chart language, you never see any chords, and chordal decisions for those types of sections are made during the recording. However the good news is that the only other part like this would be the intro, and i think i actually did not use any chords there in the recording either. However the bad news is, for that new 4 bar section which occurs in the recording but not the chart, there IS chordal information there (arranged when recording) that would certainly NOT be reflected in the chart. Also the other bad news is that the final recording is not guaranteed to be done in the same key as the chart, BUT the good news is, in this case it actually was. The good news is, i'm pretty sure i must have some sort of document somewhere that indicates the writing of those last 4 bars, either a written update or a recorded writing demo, but the bad news is i can't seem to find it and now i think it doesn't exist, and it seems more likely that i was feeling brave enough to actually re-write a 4 bar ending on the spot, in the recording session, which is a rare occurence but not impossible. The good news is i just found the written update which contains the last line written at the end. and i can say for certain that you are supposed to cross out the entire line before \"v2\" and also cross out everything up until that new line. the only reason i probably didn't cross it out is because i knew i was already recording it so i didn't need to make note of that change. but i can assure you that i never intended for that additional 4 bars to be in addition to the other 27. they are intended to replace everything from \"get it\" and after. so with some assembly required, you can take the original page 1 from here, then cross out the last 27 bars and REPLACE it with the last 4 bars of this page. and the extra 27 bars remains as a bonus alternate ending, which should NOT include the final 4"

        "question": "Hey Bill, Some of my favorite artists write songs through \"divine inspiration\": An entire song just appears in their head, and they just write down what they hear. The stuff they come up with is so intricate, it's unbelievable that a human could come up with it. I feel like my methodical, trial-and-error approach to creating music is vastly inferior. I study my favorite songs' chord progressions, melodies, timbres, rhythms, etc., to see what makes a song \"good\", and I use these conclusions to aid me in my songwriting process. But I feel like the end result isn't truly original, not inspired by something \"beyond this world\". When I sit down to make music, I feel like I'm forcing it. It doesn't feel authentic, and it doesn't sound original. I feel like I'm just ripping off my favorite artists. Part of me thinks that I haven't studied/practiced enough to convert inspiration into originality. I've only covered a few dozen songs i n-depth. Another part of me thinks that I don't have a creative/original mind, and never will. I know that you aren't omniscient, and this isn't an easy topic. But I would be truly grateful for any advice you have for me, based on the thoughts that I'm having.",
        "answer": "what makes you think they succeed at this every single time they try? that's the magic of music, and imagination in general from what you're saying, you say you catch yourself 'forcing' it. This makes me think you want it really really badly. Which makes sense. who wouldn't, after seeing what magic can be found in music. I think i have good and bad news for you. the good news is, it IS that magical, it IS other worldly, and pretty much everything about the way it functions best, makes it seem like it literally came from somewhere else. The bad news is ....... it reminds me of something you see in movies where the only way you get it is if you can actually stop thinking about it. And this is actually a problem i can sympathize with, because, if you want it so so so bad, how could you possibly stop thinking about it? but i think ultimately this IS what's going to happen. you WILL be able to calm down. whether you want to wait patiently or whether you keep kicking and screaming in desperation for a while and eventually exhaust yourself, and after all that is said and done, it WILL come. this may seem hard to believe but it wants you every bit as bad as you want it. it just really really needs you to be as open minded as possible, in order for it to feel comfortable arriving, because that's when it knows it can blow your mind the most. which, presumably, is what you've requested"

I seem to periodically flit between complicated chords, interesting harmony and trying to write geoundbreaking crazy stuff and just simple diatonic stuff with powerful melodies, more focused on the emotional conveyance - squeezing as much emotion out of a simple idea as possible, rather than trying to convey something super-interesting and harmonically spicy. I have about 15 full tracks I want to record for some kind of release, but they're all so different - some are pretty wild and others are just 3 chord ABABCB style things.

I have a traditional music background and a bachelors degree in music but when I'm actually doing stuff I ~like~ to do like song writing and recording little tunes I hardly ever write anything down minus the words and chords",
        "answer": "if you're brave enough to believe you can remember the exact melody, then that's fine. i don't like to take any chances with that. i've watched people come up with a brand new awesome idea, and then play the same thing for me again tomorrow and the melody has changed and they don't realize it, and the original was definitely better. Because new song ideas are so new, you haven't heard them very much, so you are likely to forget exactly how it went. i am not comfortable trusting that the next time i look at it i'll remember the exact melody. so i must document it exactly. Whether this is done with notation or not, it doesn't really matter to me. it can be done with recording references, and nowadays i always use recording references, because we live in such a digital world. but for a long time i was using handwritten notation. The only times i ever do it with notation is when i have no instrument near me. i used to go to the library and put in earplugs and write songs that way. nowadays, when writing songs at the keyboard, i just make recorded references and cite them in the lyric sheet. The same goal is accomplished: to exactly document the lyric, melody, and chords"

        "answer": "first, you must try to convince the song you are actually NOT trying to write it. make up a contract agreement that you and the song can sign, that says \"i am NOT trying to 'write' this song, and will not make any attempts to do so!\" and you and the song both sign it, and maybe you'll have some fine print located somewhere near the bottom of your left shoe or something. Then, as you sit down casually next to your melody, 'NOT' appearing to have any intention or desire to write the song, .... just begin trying phrases and sentences with the melody. don't worry about what's \"good\" or not yet, just start saying anything that comes to mind, with that melody. You will automatically start getting a feel for what the mechanics are (lyrically) of this melody. you'll see which kinds of words and phrases seem to always want to go in certain parts. and you'll just be internalizing the melody subconsciously, in the linguistic part of your mind. Then, put that aside, and just tell a story in your own words of what this melody is. When did you think of it? how did it make you feel? describe anything you know or feel about this melody and its origins. Sometimes you can even catch a glimpse of the exact essence of what the melody seems to be saying, even if it's the totally wrong number of words or syllables and has no physical resemblence to the shape or size of the melody. if you get this, definitely write it down. just try to PARAPHRASE (non-musically, in normal non-lyrical language) exactly what you think the melody seems to feel like it's saying. Now at this point the song will probably start to think you are trying to write it, with all the effort you've been putting in, so you will probably need an updated contract to assure everyone even more clearly that you are 'NOT' 'TRYING' to 'write' the song. then after that it's pretty much a waiting game. if you can stay calm and be patient enough for the song to forget you are trying to write it, that's when it's gonna happen"

Bezier-curved animations will look too obvious like a bezier curve (fake).

        "question": "hi bill, do you usually record the bass first, as part of a rhythm backing track along with drums, or do you record it last so that you can play some melodic lines that compliment the rest of the song? paul mccartney said that he did the latter on all beatles albums from sgt peppers, and you can really hear how the bass sounds so much nicer when it compliments the rest of the song, because it was the last thing to be recorded. come to think of it, as a one man band, what is your preferred order of recording instruments? i know it would depend on the song, but if i had to guess i'd say you first record drums, bass and keys for a backing track, then vocals, and then the extra stuff that fills in the spaces like guitar or more keys and vocal harmonies",
        "answer": "a long time ago i used to do it early, but nowadays i do it last. Actually most often on a solo project it's good to continue doing a series of temps and then go around the band and re-do each part, so everyone gets a chance to hear everyone else while they're playing (almost) first supertemp perc, then supertemp rhyth/chords, just to have something to sing over. then temp voc. then better instruments. then better vocal. and around we go"

Then i decided to go even simpler for the song title ('money') because it seemed the strongest.

A neat hack i found was to improvise the lyrics. i always seemed to sound much better when the words were genuinely made up at the time i'm singing them, instead of scripted. and if they are scripted, you have to ask a lot of similar questions that an actor would ask, about your character and your situation that you are trying to envoke. but aside from that, i also found out later that simply the more time singing makes you better. then much later on, a voice doctor told me that clearing your throat is bad, so i stopped doing that, and i also picked up a boring warm up exercise which i do on morning walks"

        "answer": "what you might be hearing, in the recording, is more of a willingness to pursue complete vocal harmonies. Typically what happened previously, when doing a full length song, is, by the time i get the regular vocal all done and set, i have no energy left to actually deal with all the vocal harmonies. Because it is a lot of work to do vocal harmonies. but around 2015 i started recognizing the importance of following through with that, and i prioritized it much more, and developed some effecient procedures for working through this. and almost every recording since then has used a significant amount of vocal harmonies. however it should be mentioned that the writing for that song was mostly done in 2010"

        "answer": "if you have to look it up somewhere else, then it must not be a very strong angel, or at least it doesn't seem to have very strong direct communicational abilities with you. if the communication is legit then you should find it a little more obvious. Then again, it's also important to remember that the communication is not happening through the number. the number is stimulating your mind/brain, to allow some genuine communication to arise. it will feel angelic because everything is angelic"

        "question": "I've come to the point where i think i know most chord progresion and harmony structures in existence. This also applies to melodies and rythms. I've listened to so much music in the last two years that i think i know way to much in comparison to what i knew before. This could seem like a good thing but in fact all the music now just sounds empty. During the last two years i used to get excited when i heard a key change or an original harmonic structure, i used to listen to music all day long and know i feel like i reached the bottom and there isn't much more i can learn. I know i still can but 80% of the total is gone and i no longer enjoy music the same way I did before, ever since december that hardly any song got stuck in my head which it used to be something normal in my everyday life, I was always with songs in my head. The same happens with piano improvisation. I feel like if i no longer have anything to play or listen and I'm starting to l ose interest in music in general. What should I do? I don't want to separate music from me. Have you ever felt this way? If so, what did you do?",
        "answer": "the skills/learning aspect of music was fun for me, but i've always been more deeply drawn to the 'voodoo' aspect of music. there's no end to the different levels of voodoo you can learn to do with music. and having technical skills is certainly a great starting place to explore that. But, if you are more attracted to the skills/learning aspect, there are many many more fields that i think would interest you a lot. from sports, to games, computers, quantum mechanics, and beyond. someone's gonna have to invent teleportation at some point"

        "answer": "\"what an interesting song\" all the way up to \"before i'm gone.\" the original version was mostly instrumental through this entire section. with 'richard' spoken in the second half, in the corresponding place to where 'chaka khan' is in the first half. also the bridge, from 'so much more', the 'so much more' melody is basically an octave lower, and then it goes into a weird 3 bar rap, which functions similar to the 'oatmeal' bit in airport terminal. Also, 'sometimes i think about it when i sleep' simply says \"i'm asleep.\" Also there is non-lyrical vocal singing along to the second chorus riff. Also the slow strings pitch bend after 'daydream' is missing. also i think i might have added some additional instrumental enhancements to the second half of the first chorus riff (for the final version). Other than that, it's nearly exactly the same there is a completed recording of it, unmixed but otherwise done. there's 2 reasons why i don't want you to hear it: 1, it sucks. 2, i actually canibalized the rap part from another song i haven't recorded yet, and i still would like to use it"

        "question": "im best friends with my own front door activates this part of my brain i can never reach. it's amazing. it's the bent key that somehow unlocks the safe to gold and crack. specifically talking about 1:40 to the end, all the lines connect together so perfectlyHOW WAS THIS MASTERPIECE MADE. i want the full backstory. maybe some lines from the timestamp i said would do..",
        "answer": "this is exactly what happened. all my life i've struggled with the reality that it takes me much much much longer than i wish it takes, to produce anything. years go by and i'm fighting to reach a reasonable pace, and never seem to succeed. well, one day i suddenly snapped, took a desperate walk outside, got angry and screamed at the sky a little (in my mind), and just said '2 weeks or die trying'. the thing is, i'm sure i've tried saying this before, but sometimes the stars align and it works. so the first part of doing any song is song selection. i go through my list of songs, which have a writing % completion of anywhere from .1% to 100%. and i have to choose one. this is normally almost impossible for me, and to do it right, i have to spend many days on it. i went through maybe 50% of the list, and it felt like none of them were really working for me at the time, and i felt a bit pressured to do it quickly (because of the 2 week challenge i was doing), and so in a snap decision, i said 'what song do i WISH i was doing', and i was able to trick myself into imagining the first line. so that was cool, felt like i was off to a roaring start, and then suddenly a day went by and i hadn't made it out of the 'box' of that melody/chord sequence. in other words, i had maybe the first 6 lines, which, as you can hear, are all within the same exact musical figure. but what scared me most was that i had spent way too long and only come up with a few seconds. and i knew this was no way to beat the 2 week challenge. so essentially i realized that i had to finish the writing in 4 hours. so basically a ruthless burst of paranoid speed had to kick in. you can probably hear the brute force, desperation, and then attempts to deal with it, in the 'bad sign' part, and 'not gonna happen' part. basically i've hurled myself off the edge, into whatever comes next, before having earthly idea what would actually come next. so in that sense i was almost improvising (in the writing). To be clear, i'm talking about the writing, which is done entirely before the recording. so i'm not saying i improvised the song during recording. i always write the song first. but during the writing process it felt a bit like improvising because i had to write it so fast. So the next few sections sort of have their ups and downs, for better or for worse, because at this point i've convinced myself that there's no turning back, i have to just run, because there's no time. And inevitably, if you are able to truly adopt this attitude, it eventually finds its feet. and that seems to happen when it lands on the outvamp, and these last 16 bars seem to be an outpouring of the exact emotions i was dealing with, in the circumstances of the 2 week challenge and all the desperation leading up to it, and how i was dealing with it"

        "answer": "started with the chorus figure. just a nice good clean hook, concise, easy to understand. that went into the list as just that much, in march 2017. this was during the late stages of the history of the entire world video production, so it felt like i hadn't done any songwriting in ages. i took a brief break to come up with some ideas. this 'oudside' hook was one of them. then it was selected several months later, probably on a semi-random selection process. then i wrote the rest, according to my standard songwriting practices and procedures going 'outside' of something. for example, if you were in column A, try going 'outside' of column A by going over to column B. it's the feeling of thinking outside the box, combined with the feeling of going outside of your house. a fulfilling/refreshing feeling going outside the main chorus/title figure (written first) was probably inspired by the feeling of being stuck on a gargantuan non-song video project for almost a year. the rest of the song, written later, would be inspired by the central chorus/figure"

Later on in the song u said u built a time machine to go to the future but go off topic so I think you saw the future in ruins because you didn't upload because a man went insane because you didn't upload so he launched nukes to blow the world up and u found that out so to save the world you needed to go back to the present And make a video. you were currently leaving a school of some sort in the I think I might quit so you left and went down to Virginia and there you flew away in your airplane. You then went to Japan to write the history of Japan down. (Going backwards in your videos.) So you then went to middle east Asia (Egypt). To write the history of the wor ld because society started in Egypt. As said in your history of the entire world you guess. You learned new found wisdom from your old family's house front door where your ancestors were born so then you went to your recording studio and made a video because it all took the span of two years and uploaded the day before the insane person nuked the world.

        "question": "What are your thoughts on improv in music? I feel like if you're improvising a solo, they'll be some really cool segments in there.. but also probably some noodling in between. What do you think is the advantage of improvising/noodling a solo as opposed to just writing/working out a melody line to play over the solo section? I feel like most musicians can probably write a melody/lead line (whatever you want to call it) that is better than something they can improvise on the spot. I think improv can definitely be a powerful writing tool, but why not improv over x amount of bars until you work out some cool parts, cut out the noodling, and just choose the best parts.. rinse and repeat until you have a cohesive 'solo' that is fully worked out and arranged? I think, even for the most talented musicians, if they're improvising an extended solo there's probably gonna be at least some moments in there that just sound kind of aimless/meandering/not very strong.",

        "question": "I know you try to write the lyrics along with the melody and chords at the same time. But how often do you get too excited about the melody and chords and just keep going without the lyrics, mumbling or with words that sound kinda right but are to be changed later? The lyrics often have to catch up later for me, but what I'll do pretty often is say the words that feel right, and then replace occasional lines and words later with better ones in one way or another. Does that ever happen with your writing?",
        "answer": "that happens to me frequently, but usually after about 2 bars it becomes clear that it doesn't quite have as much potency, power, and direction, as it does when you have some scenes, scenarios, and situational stakes involved. and the same is true the other way around that seems ok, but then it's only a matter of time before you need that strongly motivated plot twist to remind you what being awake is like"

        "question": "hi you may remember me as 2 hand - 2 chords guy. i dont think i ever really got to ask what i wanted to ask since i didnt really know what i was trying to ask. i know a bit more. say i have voicing db ab eb f bb do you categorize the voicing as simply \"Db add9 add13\" or in some way if you have to use lower 2 notes on one hand and upper 3 in other as some sort of \"Ebsus2 over Db no3\" how do you file in your brain 2 different voicings for the same chord? i think if i had a name for it, which maybe it shape itself is the name (but piano is hard in the sense that the name shapes change because of the 12 key pattern). what i mean is, if i happen to give it a name, it might be easier to transpose the thing than if im trying to go by muscle memory / shape. again, shape might work in guitar since the pattern is the same just shifted, but the pattern in piano is weird when transposed. unless you think about notes relationships by intervals and not visual or muscle \"templates\" even simpler than ebsus2 over Db no 3, i really think about it as ebsus2 over a 5th starting at Db. or weirder even to think of it as a top bb with a 4th and 5th underneath, and on other hand Db 5th. I hope this explains it better",
        "answer": "i'd call it Db6/9 if you're talking that specifically about exact voicings, then a chord symbol is not going to have enough information in it. and if it did it would be too long to read. to specify exact voicings including octave data, i think you're either gonna need staff notation or an audio sample"

        "answer": "as common as mixolydian and dorian seem to be, for the root key of songs, still key signatures tend to be immediately interpreted as ionian or aeolian. This seems kind of disappointing, but, to be fair, it is important to have an obvious way to tell someone what the real root key of a song is. Weirdly, most of the time, the key signature seems to be used to display this info AS IF it were ionian or aeolian, and then rudely use accidentals all the time. which feels kind of sad/wrong, but it happens. But actually, if you write 'C mixolydian' on the top of the page and then do it with a 1 flat key signature, i don't think anyone will mind"

Is there a reason you like to imrpovise music and script written pieces? Have you tried improvising written works, and what were the benefits and disadvantages?",
        "answer": "i thought written and scripted mean the same thing. but, then again, improvisation just means you wrote it faster, i suppose. That being said, 99% of the songs and videos i release have scripted vocals. i also love improvising lyrics/vocals, but due to various circumstances i haven't done it in a long time i suppose you'd have to do it at exactly the right speed so it could be fast enough to technically be considered improv and yet slow enough to considered written. maybe thinking of an average of 1 word every 2 seconds?"

        "question": "In the video for \"I'm a princess,\" there is an almost-constant border around part or all of the scenes. Some things, such as a few lyrics, the dream falling from the ceiling, the \"what an interesting song\" part where the guy is spinning on the bracket, etc., are not confined to the border. The thickness of the border, as well as its color, also changes throughout the video. Then when the video of you starts to play, it seems like you are referring to the border around you as a door, and these doors start doing some really interesting things and at some points there are many doors on screen, and even doors within doors. At 2:57 you can even see one of these doors forming around two other doors of you playing music. Then at 3:13, all of the scene with the set (really the whole video so far) goes through ANOTHER door (this time an actual door) and into your room, which has no borderdoor around it until the ceiling \"goes.\" This seems super intentional but I'm not quite sure what the border/door signifies in the context of this songvideo. My initial theory is that the border represents a view into a dream, and that whatever escapes that dream view is somehow escaping the dreamscape. But, like I said, I'm not sure. Regardless, I love it and think it/you are amazing.",
        "answer": "it represents \"i'm in way over my head and i have no idea how to finish this video in my lifetime and make it actually the way i want it, so i'm fucked. and i just realized borders make most things look better, so that is somewhat of a liferaft for me in this situation\" holy smokes you are very friendly"

But the writing was also rushed - i skipped the 'general writing' which means no other songs got written before jumping to select 'money'. And i also was limited to songs that had more content written, rather than picking a tiny fragment. so the options for a selection were limited. The biggest time gain on \"money\" was the decision to do the graphics drastically simpler. it was liberating. For this current one, the time has come to make a series of updates and developments in the music recording department which will help drastically streamline the entire process for decades to come"

Then, someone in the group who knows me well pulls me off to the side to talk about or engage in something we both like. i trust that person because then it's like we're in a lifeboat together, and they're pulling me safely to shore. i hope i described that situation well. i guess what i'm asking is, have you ever experienced anything like this? and is it similar to the nice feeling you get when you imagine escaping from apocalyptic scenarios?",

        "question": "Hi Bill, I recently wrote a full song (Chords, melody, lyrics, tempo, form) and I've started recording it. The problem is I'm really struggling with fleshing out the arrangement. So far I've recorded temp piano, guitar, and vocals.I feel like the song doesn't have any peaks and valleys, the verse chorus and bridge all feel at the same energy level. Maybe this is a writing or performance issue? I don't know what order to work on stuff e.g. should I have started with drums? I also don't know what sounds to use to fill out the arrangement? I'm just sitting in front of my computer scrambling to get anything that works, I spent all day yesterday working on it and all I achieved was one tiny counter melody part on vibraphone. I also don't know where these other parts should land and how to not make it sound too busy and cluttered. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I love the arrangements on your songs because they are so detailed and intricate and I love th e variety of tones and timbres you use. Thanks!",
        "answer": "i think i have the ultimate solution for this, because i think i've been through this exact same scenario before. and i can safely say that the only way i know how to solve this is to start with much much much shorter songs. Ultimately i feel like i didn't start making good progress on this until i actually started writing songs that were as short as 1 second. Then i started to watch all the necessary concepts and procedures take shape easily. and then you can gradually work your way up to longer songs after that. Starting with something full length is gonna be way too many huge unknown variables at the same time"

All our devices tell us where we are in the 7 day. And adhering to that has a validity that you just can't get with another value.

        "question": "A bit after the release of I'm A Princess, I realized the grammatical meaning of the 3rd verse (the one with the soldiers), and that, grammatically, \"dreamed that it's ok\" would refer to the soldiers doing the dreaming. I felt a bit disappointed when I realized this because to me it feels very strangely powerful to think of that line as disconnected from the previous lines in a songy sort of way, only being connected to the daydream line by a shared word, and perhaps referring to the narrator doing the dreaming. This interpretation also turns the previous lines from a sentence to just some relevant imagery, which also feels more powerful to me. Do you internalize that verse as one big sentence or as a series of disconnected lines? What did you intend?",
        "answer": "i probably intended to find something better, but, i couldn't really figure out how to work the grammar to add up correctly and still get the sound i wanted. by the way, it's \"i dreamed that it's ok\" although the \"i\" is probably not vocalized. You can put the phrase boundaries in two different places. the soldiers \"make sure i'm lonely through the daydream\", ... or ... \"through the daydream, i dreamed that it's ok\".

        "answer": "yes. What i would have preferred to do, is to be able to actually create that entire alphabetical phrase list. which i was able to generate quite easily, but the problem we run into, when the list goes into the graphics, .... the list is so long that it actually makes the computer lag, or probably even crash, depending on how you do it. There's literally millions of lines in that text pattern, if it were carried out properly from a to z across all 6 characters. So even though it's just text, it actually is an absurdly unnecessary strain on the memory of the scene, pretty much any way you slice it. And the truth is, in that scene, with the small amount of time it's shown, you'd never see all the lines. and also, another reason you don't wanna include the whole list is that the scroll direction would become incoherently out of phase. like those car wheels on tv that seem to move slow or backwards or whatever. So it turns out, even just to create the proper looking downward scroll, you need to reduce the number of elements drastically. like pretty much skip 99% of the parts during the fast scroll. But this still does create a continuity problem, because if anyone sees the (maybe 1) frame where you can see it jump from A to L or whatever, .... i feel there's gonna need to be an explanation there. So my explanation is 'memory' as a place holder for the perhaps millions of lines we've skipped"

Somewhere around 2012, i learned how to keep myself organized so i was much more able to work with items that do not necessarily belong at the beginning of the song, and evaluate if and what may come before and after, etc. and also i started doing it at the keyboard"

        "answer": "yes, that's about the same as finding a face that's neither happy or sad. it turns out, 'happy' and 'sad' are just approximate labels for the way you think a face made you feel. some people may even disagree on what's a happy or sad face you'd have to listen to it to tell. just like you'd probably have to look at a picture of a face to be able to tell which way is up. you will intuitively know when you look at it, even if you can't describe how you figured it out"

        "question": "Hey, bill. So, I wrote this little 4 bar thing in D major which starts on F# and ends on D, but there came a point where the only good note to put next was a G# in it, which makes me think it could actually be A major. It's also is in 5/4 but I was half thinking in 4/4 and 3/4 when I wrote it, so now it's just this mess that doesn't properly fit into a key or time signature, which is making it very difficult to continue on it. Any advice on how to continue with this even though it's a mess? Thanks bill, appreciate it",
        "answer": "approximately 25% of all songs in D major have a G# note in them somewhere. also about 25% of all songs have time signature changes in there somewhere, often for just 1 bar and then back to normal"

        "question": "I know you like to try and catch all your ideas. I used to too. At work in the amazon warehouse many ideas came to me. and I would run around like a crazy person trying to find a pen and paper to write them down. then at home after a while I ended up having a stack of these ideas. then two stacks and three. then I went for yoga teacher training and learned about aparigraha and wanted to become detached and the feeling I get when an idea comes feels very attached so I wanted to get rid of my stacks of ideas. so I got rid of most of them and kept a few. But now I'm thinking, why do I need to capture every idea? because I'm not the source of them. The source is endless! and if the source wanted me to have an idea at a certain point in time, it would send one, right? so maybe that's how I can remain detached while also being open to receiving ideas. But then again I have nothing to show for any of this yet, while you have much to show for your methods of capturi ng all possible ideas. So maybe I shouldn't have gotten rid of my stacks of ideas. Oh well. The past is the past.",
        "answer": "you're right that there are infinite. but the reason i think you need to write them down is because they mostly probably will not come to you at your moment of deliberate songwriting. When you go to work on songwriting, on purpose, and you need ideas, ..... the ideas might not want to come, because they feel they are being watched. Ideas seem to come more readily when you are not expecting. that's why i think it's important to write these down, because this might be your main best source of ideas. Then, the songwriting department just has to learn how to work with ideas that are handed to them, from the list. then there's whole other department called the selecting department, but that's another story entirely"

Actually, our entire existence is making sense of immense noise. the cacophony of electrical signals hitting your brain, the sight and sound, your entire nervous system, .... you are being bombarded by information. it can take a human person at least a couple years just to figure out how to make sense of the basics. to walk, talk, identify objects, etc. But eventually, once you familiarize yourself with those things, they seem normal, and they become part of a normalized baseline state. You'll also notice that when people are sleeping with any type of noise or activity going on, they tend to be more likely to wake up when the noise changes. The more you understand what's making the sounds you're hearing, you can accept them into your reality fairly lovingly"

To take it back to the root of the problem, the first thing you wanna do if you are working on a computer is: find the Export. Find the feature of your computer that actually makes a video file, in 1 file, such as mp4, that you can play in a video player. Everything else is just working backwards from there, figuring out how to change what video it is. Expand the possibilities 1 step at a time. If your video file starts entirely black, the next thing i can suggest is try to make part of it white. If the whole thing is silent, the next step will be to try to make at least some of it non-silent. and take a picture of yourself doing it so you can remember how simplicity works, in case you find yourself in a complicated emergency later on down the road"

        "question": "i really wonder the deeper reasons and thinking behind you not wanting to make an album. you often answer that with \"songs are stronger one at a time\" which makes a lot of sense, and i guess i can grasp the idea of what you mean by that. however the experience of listening to n many amount of songs and an album which is n songs long feels really really different to me? and also, i see no reason behind why the songs included in the album should lose the power of them being experienced one at a time. if you craft it with ingenuity, which you always do at all of your crafts in my opinion as far as the works you have currently made go, they could still be considered as n separate songs if wanted to by the experiencer. however, give a much differently beautiful, not stronger by definition (let's hope that both experiences have the same amount of strength which is as strong as possible) ocean of feelings, with a longer ride i guess? being in control of the order o f recommended listening, being able to do lots of interesting twists and turns by simply i dont know putting in some interlude tracks or whatever _you_ are going to invent at that road, and therefore a longer greater narrative outside the singular ones could turn into something deeper emotionally, with more investment. the songs that can still be experienced as single pieces which are strong enough for them to be considered \"good\", could also have a double triple however many as you much meaning at the whole picture, and n many songs could still be themselves in their own way? one doesn't even need to publish them one at a time, simply just planning the whole process at the writing is enough to make it so, i guess, and they could come as singles, when finished also as a whole with the extra album touches if necessary. and as far as i understood you have no problems in the writing departmant which comes like a natural language to you. this would only differentiate the process of writ ing, the amount of production that will be needed to put in would not rise, since there are still n many of songs which is lesser than the amount that you are already going to make? maybe i'm a sucker for continuity and your work and just want to listen to an album that has been made from you, i don't know. but you also don't seem like being a person who willingly refuses having more meaning, especially when the work going to be done is not exponentially increasing, which it doesn't seem like at this case. am i missing something? i would love to hear your reasoning behind not wanting to make albums in more depth, but for me it feels like those pictures made from other pictures square by square, it doesn't have to be like a jigsaw puzzle, pieces don't need to feel empty at any time, but still, you can have n beautiful pictures and a bigger greater +1, as a bonus, with nothing to lose. thank you for all the inspiration and constant reminders of me having free will, it seems like i really do need that sometimes, and your work always finds a subtle way to ring that bell. sorry for the wall of text.",
        "answer": "i always expected that to be true because a lot of people say it is, but it's not, for me. i really wanted it to be true so i've tried it many times with many different albums and it never seems true for me. the good news is i found out it is true for other things, things that are more than just songs it reminds me of how meals have their greatest effect when eaten 1 at a time if it's the longer ride, then the plea i would usually make is: 'please make it more than just songs.' A song's best friend is something that's not a song, and vice versa then please, please, (i would argue), make it more than just songs. i think this plays directly into the 'more' theme you are going for here, and i'm wondering why, in such a 'more' theme, you'd want to restrict it something so narrow as just a series of audio tracks i think so. i think you are putting me on the wrong side of the argument. i am arguing for something 'more' meaningful than an album, not less. in my opinion, at the length of an album, there's much stronger ways to use the same amount of time, in terms of creative audio/visual content. in my opinion for me personally, the downside to an album is the icky feeling it gives me when listening to it, and the inevitable fruitless search for 'which of these songs i like', (which bizarely always seems to be almost none). And yet, contrarily, any one of those songs can readily become a full blown anthem of life, when found/presented in a more specialized context: such as in a motion picture, or other significant life event"

        "answer": "it sounds like you figured out exactly what it is. you just can't find a name. and unfortunately, i can't really give you a name either, without context. assuming all 3 notes are above middle C, then all i can say is an ambiguous Emin7 at best, but different context or bass choices could make that anything from G6 to Cadd2"

        "question": "the value i see in albums is that they are just another level of grouping, just as you could say a song is a grouping of sections, sections are groupings of phrases, phrases are groupings of melodic fragments, melodies are groupings of notes, etc. there's many different ways to analyze the groupings of a song. but anyway, an album is one way to be just one tier above songs in the grouping hierarchy. i tend to like albums that seem to form a coherent and meaningful group of songs, which for me tends not to be about what order they're in as much, unless there is a narrative element. but for me grouping things is always a way to generate new meaning; grouping anything at all creates an opportunity to see what the group means as a whole, and how different aspects of parts of the group contribute to that meaning. maybe you think this does not work particularly well with songs, but for me it sometimes does. i can relate to your experience of liking songs more when taken one at a time, but there are also important albums to me, that have a meaning in and of themselves as a whole, beyond just one or a small subset of 'good songs' in them. are there any albums like that for you?",

        "question": "So, based on the music that exists, it is very clear that when lyrics and music work together to form a coherent whole, everything is amplified. Given this fact, it seems silly not to take advantage. But, the issue is, songs are supposed to be fun to listen to. At least I want my songs to be fun to listen to, that way people will want to listen to them while they work and such. But what if I want to write a song about something that is sad? Like, if I wanted to write a song about my dog dying (hypothetically), then the song would have to be slow and loud to match the terrible sadness of the death of my dog, right? But, would that song be fun to listen to? I wouldn't want to do the dishes while listening to a song that makes me feel like my dog died. So, my question is, how do I achieve a balance between lyrical and musical content while ensuring my music is enjoyable? Do I only write songs about things that are good? That seems awfully limiting. I look at th e songs that you make and the songs that other artists make about sad topics and those songs seem to sound happy while talking about things that are sad. Pink Floyd's Time, for example, talks about the stress of getting older and then it rips into a *sick* guitar solo. The thing is, it works really well, even though it doesn't really sound... sad? Like it sounds like how getting older feels, and even though getting older should feel sad, the solo doesn't feel sad, even though the solo sounds like how getting older feels. This appears to conflict with the transitive property. How do you do this?",
        "answer": "i think you have received a good hint that writing sad songs with pleasant melodies is powerful. but really, to actually do this stuff (songwriting), it's so delicate that you never know when it's gonna work right. but the more you do it, the more likely it is that you will find yourself in a situation of writing something that really works for you. to open the floodgates a little, try to give yourself a challenge to write something that's not what you mean. songwriting thrives on reverse psychology sometimes. that's because the universe thrives on reverse psychology. why? it's free games, for you and your friends to solve, through tears of joy"

If it's even, divide it by 2, and set the 2 aside as one of the factors for your final answer. to divide a number by 2, try to separate the digits into groups that form numbers you already know how to divide by 2. for example, if you have 1634, ... you can split that into 16 and 34 next to each other. you can safely half each of those, side by side, and keep them next to each other. This is assuming that you already happen to know what 16 divided by 2 is, and what 34 divided by 2 is. If you didn't, then i will go back a couple of steps and just tell you the simple fact that 16 divided by 2 is 8 and 34 divided by 2 is 17. hopefully you can remember that. So you can conclude that 1634 divided by 2 is 817. I got carried away and gave you more like 13 steps instead of 1. i'll try to give fewer steps next time, but i promise to give you all the steps i know, if you want to know them. i apologize if you already knew all of those steps. in case you were looking for something more advanced, i can tell you that 2001 is an awesome checker for both 23 and 29 at the same time"

        "question": "i hate the designation of autism, because it is a name given to a series of traits that present culture does not understand, and does not fit in with the ridiculousness that has been deemed 'normal'. it is treated as if it were a disease, to be diagnosed, rather than as one way that a person can exist as. the world feels like a narrow obstacle course and i didn't get the instruction pamphlet for the obstacle course that was handed out to everyone else. i sometimes feel like understanding communication is deciphering code and making dangerous assumptions. but i like to be touched and i love eating. i never get 'hyperfixated' (hate the term), i wish i did because that would mean something could interest me for a prolonged period of time, i can't think of anything that has interested me over the course of my life other than maybe videogames, but i spend a lot of my free time laying down and trying to escape the world, which is stressful and scary and overwhelmi ng. and i am socially awkward and i need to sometimes move to calm down and sometimes i just cant remember names and when im with others its like i become them and assume their personalities and have wondered often if i have a personality, seems like i am a blank slate. worst of all, the things that i think are interesting are shameful, when i try to share with others they mock me and call it cringe or weird, i don't know what i am but whatever i am it seems like i came to the wrong party. if i do the things i really wanna do i don't think there is any way i could get money from it, unless i am like amazing at it, even then not much. given the information above, what are some ways i can improve my situation?",

        "question": "Please give us the rest of the factorizing steps!",
        "answer": "i can't give them all at once, because there's way too many. but let's pick a random number up to a million and i'll try to tell you the first 3 things i would do. The number we're working with today is 306124. The first thing is, notice it's even. How do we know this? because the last digit is even. so first we gotta cut the whole thing in half. this can be done by slicing it where you see even numbers that you can handle. so for me that's 30 6 12 4. cut those in half, and keep them in the same order, preserving the digits. so that makes 15 3 06 2.... or 153062. Next, notice it's still even. do the same thing again. this gets tricky because you have a lot of consecutive odd numbers in there. cutting numbers in half when they have a lot of odd digits, without paper, can be a little annoying. but if you can handle the 1530, then the 62 part is easy. 1500 in half is 750, plus the 15 is 765. and the 62. so 76531. Now it's odd and you can't divide it anymore. So you can go ahead and put some 2's in your final answer, because you divided it by 2, twice. so you know that your answer is going to include 2 twice. Now, you're left with an odd number: 76531. The next step is to check if it's divisible by 3. The trick for this is, and most people seem to know this trick, if the number is divisible by 3, all the digits are gonna add up to a multiple of 3. so you can group them. so, looking at 76531, .. knock out the 6, i can knock out 7 and 5 (75, mult of 3, or 57, either way, same thing) knock out the 3, ... and you're left with 1 which is non-3. so by knocking out digits and groups of digits which add to 3 or mult of 3, if all the digits got knocked out that way then we know it's a mult of 3, but if we were left with any non-3s, (which we were), then we know it's not a mult of 3. Ok, now the real game begins. We're going to check every other prime number, in ascending order. No need to check 5, because we can see that it's not a multiple of 5 (hopefully you can see that outright ... but the way to tell that is if the last digit is 0 or 5, which it's not). So next we're going to check 7. Every prime we're going to check from here on out will be based on the same system. We're going to manipulate the main number (76531) by adding or subtracting the checker as many times as we want. IF the main number is a mult of 7, then that means we can add or subtract 7 as many times as we want, and it should STILL be a mult of 7. We can ALSO DIVIDE the main number by ANYTHING and it should still be a mult of 7, if it originally was. So basically the idea is to do these manipulations in a way that gets you to something you recognize as a mult of 7 or not. There are many ways of doing this. First, if you want, you can just drop the 7 from the left. because this essentially would mean you're subtracting 70000. which, if the original number was a mult of 7, then it should still be a mult of 7 when you subtract 70000. so we'll knock out the 7, and you have 6531. Next, i'm going to do probably the most common technique, which is to work from the right. Here's an interesting principle: if we've already reduced the main number in the ways we've already reduced it (cut it in half until it's odd, divide by 3 until it's not a mult of 3, divide by 5 until it's not a mult of 5), then THAT MEANS that for ANY future prime number you wanna check, you can ALWAYS cause the number to level off with a zero at the end by either adding or subtracting THE CHECKER OR ITS TRIPLE. That's because all your future prime numbers that you're gonna check are gonna end in either 1,3,7, or 9. So that means those are always either 1 or 3 away from 10. And if you've already reduced your main number properly, then that number will ALSO always be either 1 or 3 away from the nearest 10. So you just pick which maneuver to make based on what you need. So looking at our main number as it stands now, 6531, and if we're checking for 7, i can tell you that what you wanna do is subtract 21. That's how you can get it to level off to a zero at the end. 6510. and of course you can drop the zero, because that does NOT change whether or not the main number is divisible by 7. so that leaves you with 651. the same move again works: subtract 21, gets you to 630 and drop the zero, you have 63. Do you recognize it yet, as something that you know to be a multiple of 7, or something you know to not be a multiple of 7? you might recognize 63 as a multiple of 7. But in case you don't see that, you could make another move, by adding 7, and you get 70, drop the zero, is 7. Now do you recognize it (7) as either being a multiple of 7 or non-multiple of 7? i think you do. So we can confirm that 7 is one of the factors. next comes the not so fun part where you have to actually divide 76531 by 7. then when you get the result, continue working with this new main number, and you also have to check 7 again on that number in case it's in there twice"

        "question": "I have a chord I made out of these notes: F#-C-\u2642-Eb-B-E but I've been struggling to add more notes to it to make it sound more better. also it's starting to become hard to put the fingers on the piano in the right spot. the piano is really a mess as it starts to become more difficult to read, feel, type, and play these notes together! how much effort do you need to put into this? I had started with \u2640-F#-C-D which sounded good imo but there were 2 female chords behind it so I didn't feel comfortable with it so I changed it to F#-C-\u2642-Eb-B-E and it didn't sound good so I'm trying to make it sound right how do I do this without making it female? This is seriously becoming a problem as for most of the time in my days I am stuck trying to figure out this one chord. I've tried so many chords like \u2642-B-Db-E-F-F#-A-B but it just doesn't sound good and is very hard to play",
        "answer": "not all your symbols came through, also i need to know the whole context for when and where it's being used, but, without knowing any of the context, it looks like probably more than enough notes for a chord not effort, joy i've never heard of chord gender it's not clear to me how these are being used, but, if you have E, F, and F# all together, you're probably gonna have a bad time. How about looking at the melodies of some of your favorite songs? and just adding 1 extra harmony note to some of the best parts"

        "question": "So, Bill, I got a question about melodies. I'm sure a great deal of people don't know about modes, or at least not all of them (I certainly don't). But my question is, does every melody fit into some sort of mode? Like, someone who doesn't know modes could write something in C major that's mostly diatonic, but with a #F and then technically it's lydian. Does every melody fit diatonically to a mode? I kind of hope not because that feels very restricting (I like a good chromatic melody) but I thought I'd ask my go-to 24/7 music tutor. Anyways, have a good day.",
        "answer": "almost maybe it's like the weather. is the whether usually about the same, over the course of 1 day? ........ almost maybe. a good bench mark is to check all the songs you know and see what they do. and see when it gives you that tingly feeling"

        "question": "any opinions on how to make my electric guitar sound softer? i have a good tone i guess, but i want to make it much more softer, i wan't to have that sort of thing when it feels like the string is not even plucked at that moment, but a while ago, continuously, like a violin but with less burst... i can't manage to get that feel trying out my effects and i'm kinda stuck here... even if you are not mainly a guitar player, i would consider your opinions from a sound design perspective, thank you",
        "answer": "it sounds like what you are describing is what would happen if you turn your volume knob down, play the note, and then turn up the volume while you are still holding the note. if you get a volume pedal, then you can do the volume with your foot so you can have both hands free to play the notes"

        "answer": "i'm trying to tell from your description whether you write the song first ..... if you don't, i would suggest trying that. you can use paper or demo recordings to help you remember it, because brand new songs are hard to remember accurately. when i say 'writing' i mean only specifically enough for a person to play and sing it with 1 instrument. no need to plan out everything, just the melody/lyric/chords, an exact tempo, and a full roadmap. that's my method. That doesn't mean i know exactly how the song will sound before i produce it, and it doesn't stop me from feeling empty sometimes at the start of production, but, what's most important is that i do know exactly how the song goes. there's already enough unknowns in the production process details, even after knowing the song"

        "answer": "it's a nice blend. there are many different possibilities for the future, and the brain allows us to explore this, and then create it, if we are brave enough"

        "question": "Hey Bill, I feel hopeless. I feel trapped by my parents, who have kept me locked up all my life. With quarantine, things just got worse and it honestly feels like I'll never find my way out of this place, out of their influence. I'm about to turn 18 and next year I should be heading to college. However, I can't go anywhere out of state because my parents say they won't pay for it, but they do have the money to do so, which means I can't apply for any financial aid. So I'm basically an adult now, but I can't begin to act like one because I have neither money nor a car or anything. I've just wanted to break free for as long as I can remember, and for the last few years I kept myself studying hard considering that'd provide for me, it would give me a way out. But now that the time has actually come for me to go to college, and I realize I don't have any passions anymore and the only thing that's left is a escape, which it won't provide either. Everyday I h ear more sarcastic comments about how everything I do is flawed and I'm never enough and I just don't want to keep doing this, taking everything they say to me. And I genuinely can't see this going on for more 5 years or so, till I finish college and get a job, without me completely falling apart. I just don't know how long I'll be able to hold on. I feel hopeless. Do you happen to have any kind words?",

        "question": "hihihihihi bill I got my first job ever, in a retail place, and I noticed something that I think is mind blowing. People come into the store in waves. As in, the store will be completely empty, then someone comes in, and within about five minutes, 2-3 other people or groups come in after them. Separate groups. From different entrances. Coming in within minutes of each other. CONSISTANTLY. Then they clear out around the same time too. Groups that are NOT TOGETHER. NOT COMMUNICATING. NOT TRAVELING TOGETHER. and yet they are. It's almost totally predictable (there are outliers). And i get that sometimes there are other factors, like the bus stopped here, or it's after the lunch rush and everyone is coming after eating, or there's construction outside bringing people this way, or things like that. But I am not aware of any of that happening. And it's like, are they coordinating, talking to each other on l ittle walkie talkies? No! They're just doing it naturally, some how. Is there some other reason that I'm missing? Or do we humans just have some kind of subconscious magnetism to each other??",
        "answer": "it's a combination of reasons that are knowable (such as bus schedules, etc), reasons that are not knowable (too subtle), and then finally you can add at least a 300% hype bias, like finding shapes in the clouds. the shapes distract you from the non-shapes every time. and another bonus reason i just thought of, which is that if people see people go into a store, that makes it seem suddenly more appealing to go into that store"

        "question": "Part of what makes your songs so good is that you sort of force people to actively listen by including relevant visual information. There are aspects of music that many don't even hear or notice unless being shown what it is and when to listen for it. In so many words, your videos are just as much a part of your songs as the music is. I'm sure you're well aware of this so my question is, how do you go about applying this? When you're recording the music, do you already have ideas for how to visualize it and do you initially write your songs in a way that you feel will translate well to video?",
        "answer": "i have no idea. i've barely been able find a way, and even if i do, sometimes it takes about 1000 years. sometimes that makes it so discouraging that it takes me another 1000 years to recover yes, but that doesn't mean i'll be able to succeed in producing that, visually a new writing technique is to imagine visual scenes first, and then see what music seems to belong there. That has nothing to do with producing the video, the video might not even look like that, but it turns out to be a useful songwriting technique. it turns out, music and non-music are best friends with each other"

If the chorus is the best part of the song (in many cases), why aren't songs just choruses over and over again? If verses are used to separate chorus from chorus, why don't we make verses exactly like choruses, and make songs that switch back and forth between two different equally catchy choruses?",
        "answer": "sometimes they are. the only way to know if this works for your song is to try it you can try anything you want and see what you like best. but, think of it like drawing hills. try to draw a bunch of hills but only the high part. make them stay high the entire time. hopefully this may help you understand the game we're dealing with"

I used to seek a lot of validation from others before, but now I'm slightly more self-confident. However, a few people have asked me if I'm depressed or something and try to figure out what's \"wrong\" with me (and they try to be subtle about it), and I just get the general feeling that people don't like being in my presence because I'm too uncomfortable or stand-offish.

OR do you simply strive to be 'good' in the art you create, using originality as one of many ways to create something good? i ask because it seems like there is an interesting paradox you present by saying that so much of what you do (for example, the fonts that you use in videos) is 'normal', but i know that originality and novelty must be very valuable to you.",

        "answer": "the line itself is music. i was engaging in a bit of music-writing, which i suppose is similar to witchcraft, but less evil basically i was on the way into re-hab for using the word 'dream' too much in most of my previous songs. but then i slipped and relapsed x100. as a result, it seems, the song turned out to be a celebration of everything dreams can be sort of"

        "answer": "it sounds like you want to 'write music', but you don't want to 'write music'. i think the key here is figuring out the difference between the thing you want to do, and the thing you don't actually want to do. for some reason you're thinking of them as the same thing right now, but they must be different somehow, based on the fact that you know you want to do 1, but you don't seem to want to do the other. so the whole key here is to try to understand in more detail what each thing is, until you realize how they are different"

        "question": "When you're writing a song, (you've said you work on them piecemeal), do you try to go back to your mindset of when you first wrote it? Do you try do add lyrics that continue an idea that you want to get across? Or are you adding lyrics that feel natural to you now, and whatever emotion sparked the initial draft is only in the subsequent lyrics as a result of proximity? I guess another way to ask, is there an overall 'soul' to your lyrics that exists at the outset, and by working on the song are you trying to capture it better/more completely; or are you developing the soul as you go and its not wholly there at the outset? thx",
        "answer": "yes. it's easy to forget that, but that's the real power move it's best when the lyrics and music are conceived at the exact same time"

'bookreviewer'...... 'chef'...... many different terms, with varying levels of specificity, and varying levels of accuracy too, which of course is the nature of language probably, as usual"

        "answer": "there's 2 things i can recommend, separately. first, just try to let yourself know, whenever you think you hear someone doing it really good. you'll feel yourself instinctively saying \"oh yeah.... yes, this feels really good, i'm enjoying this\". just make a brief mental note of when you are feeling this. just be aware of that feeling, what it felt like, and what it seemed to sound like. Then, besides that, just spend a lot of time playing along to recordings where walking should happen. try some things, .... and you may notice it may feel a little uncomfortable if what you're doing does not give you the same \"oh yeah\" feeling that you got before, but, if you keep playing along with those songs, eventually you're gonna find it. you'd have to. it's like a rat finding cheese in a maze"

        "question": "it feels like there's a level of disconnect between the narrators in your songs and the real bill wurtz. have you ever written / thought about writing something that really smashes that disconnect and explores your actual personal thoughts and feelings from your own actual perspective? what are your thoughts on writing personally vs based on somewhat different characters that somewhat embody how you feel, and your approach to that kind of system?",
        "answer": "my songs don't usually have narrators, but, the song writer is definitely me i will try to find some examples of parts of my songs that tell unequivocally true statements, from my point of view: from the song 'more than a dream': \"every day seems so different\" \"i can't believe what i'm seeing, it's more than a dream, and it's more than anyone ever dreamed in history\" \"and on the best days you'll believe again that the best dreams can be real again\" from the song 'money': \"it's time for the show\" from the song \"here comes the sun\" \"here comes the sun, bringing you love and shining on everyone\" \"i hope you know that there's no stranger strange enough\" which, paraphrased more clearly, would be something like \"i hope you're aware that every person in this world is a real person, just like you, and everyone would truly love each other if we knew who we all really were\" \"ding ding ding dang ding ding, put it into words and then send it all over the world\" from the song \"it's the first day of school (and i think i might quit!)\": \"gonna learn some new lessons i won't forget gonna write them all down in the language of love and then teach them to everyone\" from the song \"at the airport terminal\": \"at the airport terminal the planes are landing\" \"traveling somewhere and it feels fantastic, rolling across the terminal floor\" (with 'rolling' meaning walking, possibly with a wheeled suitcase) \"everybody here is having an unusual day\"....\"in an unusual time zone\".... \"and i'm feeling fine in an unusual way\" from the song \"just did a bad thing\": \"how many times is the game going to change\" \"it's the best scheme i have, and that's bad [good] enough for me\", which would refer to any time i've ever truly given my best effort from the song \"the easter bunny told me that christmas isn't real (but santa claus is still jesus)\": \"everything feels so alive for the very first time\" which means \"[around the christmas/holidays/late-december time, sometimes] there is a deeply warm joyous and magical feeling that i can't quite describe except by using [these words, sung with this melody and these chords, like this] from the song 'slow down': \"and i think i'm bobblin to a brighter day\" from the song 'long long long journey': \"it's a long long long journey that we've been on, and it's a long long long story that can be told\" \"we've come a long long way\" \"there's still a long way to go\" from the song \"when i get older\": \"when i get older, i'm gonna be stronger, so i can lift up the whole entire world\" which more correctly translates to \"sometime in the future i'd like to have the ability to deeply inspire many many many people, maybe so much that it might fulfill some of my unmet childhood needs somehow\" \"and i don't quite know what it means, but it feels like the song knows me\" (this describes any experience of listening to a song that really hits strongly, perhaps beyond my ability to fully understand exactly why) from the song \"i'm best friends with my own front door\": \"i saw the sign, i saw the sign, it's a bad bad sign\" which refers to the fact that i realized that i only have 4 more hours to compose the entire remainder of this song, if i wanna have any chance of staying in line with my new extremely ambitious production goal of 1 song/video released every 2 weeks \"cuz i'm hungry [to achieve my goals] and scared and i can't find the truth [figure out how the hell to do this, because i've been trying for so many years] so i'm leaving [so i don't give a fuck i'm gonna accomplish this NOW] oh, there's my balloon [holy crap i'm actually doing it, it's as if i've just been able to grab onto a balloon that can now carry me up and away from the pit of eternal failure i thought i was falling into]\" \"that's how the game begins, oh, that's how i get home again\" [hopefully this is the beginning of a continued trend of achieving my production goals, which i've been seeking so deeply for so long, as one would seek their true home]\" from the song \"hallelujah\": \"hallelujah\" (that's just a true word, it's always true when anyone says it) from the song 'hello sexy pants': \"but down in congress, all the boys get mad\" (actually writen like a fictional line, but it happens to be true that \"the representatives on the floor of a 2-party government tend to argue with each other\") \"everywhere somebody lonely is still feeling blue\" (i'm just assuming this must be statistically true) from the song 'and the day goes on': \"and the day goes on\" which more accurately means, \"and time/life goes on\" \"hold on\"...\"stay strong\"... which is just general encouragement i would give to anyone, as time and life goes on from the song \"La de da de da de da de day oh\": \"i don't have enough time to say the things i wanna say [i feel like i'm not going to have enough time to write and produce all the material i want to express, which is mostly because of the high quantity of things that i want to express, combined with the high amount that i care about it which will cause me to take it so seriously that it will therefore probably take me a long time. at least this is currently how i'm feeling in februrary of 2009 as i say this]\" \"i wanna write a song\".....\"is that so wrong\" [asking myself this, around february 2009, when i was feeling like i definitely hadn't written enough songs] \"La de da de da de da de day oh\" [simulation of what it might sound like, to sing such a song] \"i went down to the mall, then they closed down the mall\" [written with a fictional spirit, but it's almost completely based on that time i went to my local mall and i noticed that about 75% of the stores in the mall seemed to have suddenly gone out of business, and i didn't know why, and it felt spooky from the song \"outside\": \"gonna go out and away from the lines\" (just describing one of my typical creative goals) from the song \"got to know what's going on\": \"give me a chance to believe it\" (this is just a general prayer to be able to find genuine truths that can be believed in) \"we've got to know what's going on\" which means \"it seems like we all really would like to know what's really going on in the world, and why, and what it all means... or at least i would certainly like to know\" \"we've got to know so we can be strong\" which means \"it feels like we'd all probably find a lot of strength in truly knowing and understanding the world\" \"whatever it is i'll believe it\" (whatever the realest greatest deepest truth is, i promise to believe it) from the song \"in california\": \"in california you can smoke marijuana [i'm pretty sure marijuana is now legal in california (for medical purposes at least) (at the time of writing, in 2011) and the reason this seems like interesting news is because marijuana has been illegal in most places for a very long time]\" \"in california you love who you want to [i'm pretty sure there's no gender restrictions on marriage, in california, (at the time of writing, in 2011) which is interesting because i think that's been illegal in most other states for a long time]\" from \"alphabet shuffle\" \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, i'm alive\" from various extremely short videos/songs: \"i've been thinking a long time\" \"music makes me feel so interesting\" \"get ready for november\" [on halloween which is the last day of october and thus right before the beginning of november] \"i'm addicted to sunshine\" \"yes i like music\" \"just wanna make longer videos, ones that last a really really long time\" \"just wanna make stronger [LONGER! LONGER THAN 6.5 SECONDS PLEASE] videos, online\" \"time to rearrange my world\" [time to try a new configuration of furniture in my bedroom/studio so that the desk faces away from the wall, toward the door, to hopefully give me a more professional attitude, as opposed to the previous configuration of facing the wall, as it always did before the time of saying this which is april 7, 2011] \"hello, i'm a piece of garbage\" which is a dramatization/paraphrase/summarization in 2015 of a 2007 journal entry i found which seemed to be completely devoid of any useful content and was also written during an extremely bad time in my life, at least according to my memory of it \"oh hi, thanks for checking in, i'm still a piece of garbage\" which is a dramatization/paraphrase/summarization in 2015 of another 2007 journal entry i found (it's from slightly later than the previous page i found and dramatized) which seemed to have the same exact sort of terrible and useless flavor as the note i had found just moments ago for the previous dramatization \"are you the real you?\" which is a 2015 paraphrase/dramatization of a 2004 journal page which actually said \"how happy would you be if someone were 'examining' your life right now?.... how does your life hold up under the 'pressure of the pen'?\" \"i'm gonna figure out what everything means\" which is a 2015 dramatization/paraphrase of the time in early 2011 when i spent several weeks trying to come up with some kind of actual scientific thesis about the exact effects that various chord sequences have on the perceived meaning of the songs they're used in \"got to know (just) what i'm doing with my life\" which is a 2015 dramatization/summary of what i was probably feeling when i started much more actively pursuing keyboardplaying+singing in july of 2008 it seems that one of the best ways to get real potent results is to use a lot of truth mixed with some creative alternatives to the truth. if done right, this almost has the effect of training the soul to spot the truth. the soul seems to be nourished by this. at least that's the way it feels for me"

        "question": "Looking back at old questions, you seem pretty resolute in the idea that melody/lyrics come first, the melody has \"chord residue\" on it, and then you form the chords etc around that. That makes a lot of sense to me, but I've found that since I'm not a lyricist (yet), that I tend to prefer to build a song from the emotions that I'm feeling, and those emotions come out most clearly in the form of a series of chords (with certain phrasings) on the piano. Melodies fall out later, sometimes out of those chord phrasings. Do you think this difference in approach is just a matter of opinion? Could your stronger focus on lyrics be what creates that difference? Or do you believe that I'd actually have a more fulfilling time with songwriting if I work on making lyrics and/or melodies first?",
        "answer": "there's many different ways to do it. yours is good. if you ever get restless, you can switch, but you don't have to i might be focusing on the lyrics slightly more than you might be, but i also focus on lyrics less than someone who writes lyrics first with no melody. i almost never do that. so in that sense i am somewhere in the middle. lyric/melody are linked for me, and that package is usually the driving force, but sometimes i do things differently. sometimes a vamp will be the first thing. sometimes a melody (no lyric) will be the first thing. occasionally lyric with no melody will be first, but that's only when i'm playing a ridiculous game i call \"title first\", and that's just for the title if you start to get bored doing it the way you are doing it, then you could try other ways. but if you are enjoying your way then that means it's going good"
