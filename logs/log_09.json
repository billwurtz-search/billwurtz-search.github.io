        "answer": "the song you are making has never existed before, and it's brand new. so it means you haven't heard it very many times. so of course you may forget it. that's why it's so important to write new ideas down in sufficient detail to fully know how they go. of course you're going to forget, because it's brand new and you haven't heard it before. not writing it down is pretty careless, in my opinion. i realize it is often possible to just remember new ideas fine, but on the other hand there can be a lot of agony if you think you might remember but you're not sure. i need to know for sure. always write it down. in my view that is the only professional option"

        "answer": "that's not the reason. the reason is because many of those previous programs stopped existing. but this also triggered some much greater revelations. now i'm actually using more programs than before that's 1 of many pieces to a larger puzzle this is one of the more impossible things to predict, and a source of daily traumatic anguish for me, as i continue to move in a stepwise pattern as always"

        "question": "your dedication to getting things done honestly amazes me. martin molin often talks about delayed gratification; he's been working on an extremely complex marble machine for the past 3 and a half years and he's been talking about how it's hard to stay motivated when you're working on something for so long and you don't get to see the finished product until the end. but even he does weekly build logs, which is a regular form of creative output. You, on the other hand, spent almost a year working exclusively on HotEWIG with no output whatsoever. and you're doing something similar right now, except you don't even really seem to have a solid, set end goal this time. there's no one big project you'll get to release at the end of this that will make you feel satisfied like all of that hard work culminated into this one big thing. how do you do it? I can't possibly imagine sitting down and spending over a year teaching myself a skill without even a pro ject in mind. basically you are incredible and i would like to know your secrets",
        "answer": "yes i do, i am doing the filmmaking revolution. i'm sure other people are doing it too, because that's just what time it is 1 isn't nearly enough things to release. if i only did 1 thing, then why did i even make a website. you get what i'm saying sometimes if i feel like 1 department or avenue of development is taking too long and i feel disconnected from it, it can be good to do an overview list of all the different things that need to be taken care of and how they tie into the big picture. as soon as you return to the big picture all the original motivations should come through loud and clear all projects are in mind. my mind is overwhelmedly overflowing with projects. that is surely how i got into this mess my secret is telling all the secrets, not necessarily when they are asked, but at other times"

DON'T put it if it doesn't fit, but just keep searching from place to place until it really fits. doesn't count if it doesn't fit. with this technique you have to keep searching until it really fits, but it does still also have to go somewhere. but NOT anywhere, has to fit. but it has to go somewhere. i hope i have explained that properly. Also, you still have to do the song's core with fewer and more reliable basic instruments, but the decorations should be done on a 'what then when' basis rather than a 'when then what' basis. this is for production. writing usually goes the other way (when-what)"

        "answer": "usually what seems to work best (for me) is to make sure you fully write the song first, before really recording it. know exactly how it goes, and for exactly how long. Doing a full recording/arrangement of a song is crazy enough, and if you don't know how the song goes you'll surely crumble. unless you are doing the type of arrangement that can be delivered in its final form in real time. It's like building a house. you have to know the specific plans of the house before building it, unless you have technology so advanced that the house can be built instantly, in which case yes you could definitely improvise the house"

Then looking at 7, from the left is 269, that's prime so 7 is out. and 11, from the left on the original, leaves 307 so no; 13 off the right side of 3769 (via 39) is 373, then 360, so no; looking at 17, we'll go from the left from 34 makes 369, which is just 123 (that's just 41) so no; looking at 19, from the right makes 375, 5 away from 38 so no; 23 can take 69 off, left with 37 and no; 29 off the right makes 374, in half is 187, not 29 (87 would be); only have to get up to just over 60 on this; checking 31 from the left leaves 669 or 223 which is itself prime so no; 37 knocks right off to 69 and no; 41 on the right brings you to 381, down to 34(0), not it; 43 can go via 301 on the right which makes 4070, 407 being the wrong distance from 430; 53 can use 901 on the right, makes 467, adding 53 again goes to 52 WOW close; doing 59 from the right makes 371, and then up to 43 so no; 61 and this will be the last one because 60 squared is 3600 and 67 squared will obviously be well on its way toward 4900 so 61 is really the only hope and if i've made no mistakes so far it would have to be squared which clearly would be the wrong answer because it doesn't end with 1, but we can check anyway on the right, goes up to 383 which is prime itself but if you don't believe that then just take away 183 (61's tripple) and you're left with 100 so 61 is out. Making the final answer 3769x3"

        "question": "Was the \"just got home, got no home\" part in La de da planned from the start or did you just think \"let's add this part and see how it goes\" in the very last minute? That part is so absurd and yet it's so satisfying to listen. I don't know how you come up with this stuff.",
        "answer": "that was an extremely late re-write. i had already re-written the ending many times and nothing was working until i found that sometimes you have to think of it like the door. when you're building a room, and you're trying to build a way out of the room, ..... sometimes you need a door, and the trouble with that is that doors look nothing like the room, and they are very different from a room, mainly because you can't go inside a door. but this is the different mindset you have to be in sometimes, when you can't seem to get \"out\" of a song. usually i just think about doors and that does it for me"

        "answer": "that has 3 in it, if this doesn't break down to less than 6 digits (before getting to 7,11,13 etc) i'm not doing it. i have firm boundaries. taking 3 out gives you 2 28 17 04..... 2281704, in half gets you 114 085 2..... 1140852. in half again gives you 57 04 26..... in half again gives you oh wait wow, another 3 is in here.. that would give you 19 014 2.... 190142. and in half gives you 95071. holy darn it does get under 6. ok well since i'm not a liar at least not today, i will go forward. to take 7 out, can go from the right, 9505, then up to 954, down to 94, no. 11 means 9506, then up to 955, knock off the 55, so no. 13 gives 4071 (from the left) and 171, so no. 19, knock off 95 so no. 2001 (for 23 and 29 both) goes to 9307, then 107 (for 23, from left), and 951 (using 203 for 29, from right) then up to 98 and no. 31 just knock off 93 so no. 37 just add 999 so 9607, add 333 is 994 and no. 95071, doing 41 from left is 9503, take 123 from left is like 950 minus 12, is 938, plus 82 is like 94 plus 9, 103, no. 95071 doing 43 use 301 from right is 9477, add 43 is like 945 plus 4 is 949 add 41 is 99, so no. 95071 doing 47, from left (via 94) leaves 1071, again from left gives 131, no. 95071. 53 use 901, from left is 4971, again from right is 407, add 53 is forty something so no. doing 59 on 95071, on right, is like 9507 plus 6, is 9513, minus 1003 is 851, being 50 away from 901 so that's just not gonna work. 95071 trying 61 is 9501, goes down to like would be 950 minus 6, so 944, in half is 472, again is 236, and 118, and 59, close but too late. 95071, trying 67 using 201 comes down to 9487. down to 942, then 471 (half) down to 41 and no. 95071, 71 falls right off so no. 95071 checking 73 via 511, down to 9456, in half to 4728, again to 2364, and 1182, and 550+41 is 590, no. checking 79 via 711, on 95071, is 9436, in half is 4718, in half is 2359. add 711 is 3070, 307 (prime) so no. 95071 checking 83 from left is 13071, and 249 on right is like 1307 plus 25, is 1332, in half is 666 which is just 37 so no. 95071 checking 89, on left is 6071, add 89 is like 607 plus 9, is 616, 308, 154, 77 and no. 95071 trying 97, use 291 from right is 9478, halfed is 4739, add 291 is 503, add 97 evens off so no. 95071 minus 101 is 9497. plus 303 is 98. 95071 checking 103, so add 309 is 9538, minus 618 is 892, in half is 446 to 223, already prime so no. 95071 next is 107, take 321 from left is 9475, can use 535 and subtract it from right is 894, is 447, down to 34 so no. 95071 plus 109 is 9518. minus 118 is 94, no. 95071 doing 113, so add 339 is like 9507 plus 34 is 9541, plus 339 is like 954 plus 34 is 988, so 494 and 247 which is just 19xsomething (not it). 95071 checking 127 so take 381 from the right, and it's like 9507 minus 38 so like 9462 plus 7 is 949, minus 339 so like 94 minus 33 is 61 and no. 95071 checking 131 means 9494 and no (101). 95071 try 137 or 411, so 9466, 4733, plus 137 is like 473 plus 14 is 487 so like 48 minus 13 and no. 95071, do 139 is like 9507 plus 14 is 9514 so the weird technique gives 4202 and so 4757. 417 will work (139x3) so 434. and 217, no. 95071, doing 149, add it is like 9507 and 15, so 9522. add 398 is 992, and again is 139, too bad so close. 95071 doing 151, is like 9507 minus 15, 9492, in half is 4746, and 2 37 3, ok 2373 plus 447 (151x3) is like 237 plus 45 is 282, or 141 close again but just missed it. 95071 use 471 (for 147) easy enough, goes down to 946, and 473, clearly so close to 471 so no. 95071 doing 163, use 489, is like adding 49 to 9507. so 9556. in half is, the ugly way, 4223, to 4778. the ugly way again is 2334, to 2389. minus 489 is clearly a loser. 95071, doing 167, use 501, 95071 goes to 9457. minus 67 is 939, that's 131 so no. doing 173, use 519. like 9507 plus 52. so 9559. minus 519 is 904. is 452, is 113 so no. so 181, from 95071, ... like 9507 minus 18.....9490 minus 1, 9439. 944 plus 18 is 962, in half is 481, so no. i'm changing my boundaries after this round. 95071 doing 191, .. 9507 minus 19 is 9488, is 4744, is 2 37 2, is like 1150+36 , 1186, is 593, and no (would need 573). 95071 doing 193, use 579. so like 58 plus 9507. so 9565. so 1913. too close to 1930. 95071 doing 197, use 591, so like 9507 minus 59 i hate this, 9448, and 4724, and 2 36 2, and 1181, then minus 591 is like 118 minus 59 which is 59 so no. so doing 199 is 95071, 9527, minus 597 is 903, to 1400 so no. 95071 i hate most things, doing 211, so 9486. 4746. 2 37 3. ... 2373. minus 633... 174, no. 95071... 223, use 669, 9507 plus 67, 9574. plus 446, like 957 and 45. 997 and 5, 1002, 501, no. 95071 and 239, 9531, like 953 and 24, 977 that's the right range and end digit for 239x3 but the 977 digits don't add up so no. 95071 doing 241, like 9507 minus 24 is 9483, using 241x3 which is 723, using it on 9483, ... 876. to 438, and 219 no. 95071 doing 251, 9475 but 9482. 4741. 474 but 449, will then even off to something hundred 00. 95071 doing 257, trip is 771, 943, 94 plus 26 is not it. 95071 doing 261 dont need it, 263, x3 is 789 yowch, 9507 plus 79 is 9586, in half is like 4243 but 4793, 479 minus 26, 453, will even off to 2 digits so no. 267 dont need it, 269, 27 plus 9507 is 9534, 4767, this is the worst, have to do triple of 269 which is 807.... subt from 4767... 396. should be 99. ok so no. only have to go up to about 310 because 310 sq is 96100. almost there. 271, easy 948... 474... 237, no. 277, trip, is 831, 9507 minus 83.... 8524, 4132, ...2 66 no. i can almost taste the sweet nectar of being done with this. 281... 9507 minus 28, 9479, ... 948 plus 28... 976. 450 plus 36, 488, 211 no. 283, times 3 is 849. 9507 plus 85 is 9592 is 4241 but 4796. this is the definition of pain. 2343 but 2398, 1199. that's 109 so no. 95071 doing 293, triple that is 879 yipes, like 88 plus 9507. 9595 no. next is actually 307 which has to be the last one because 31 sq really is 96100 for sure. so the only way 307 would work is if i made a mistake and it's times a different, lower number, because 309 is not needed and the digit is wrong (1) for 7 sq. But we'll check anyway, ... 307 is 921, 95071 minus 921 is 9415. doubled is 1893, plus 307 is 22 so no. So the final answer is 95071x5x3x3x2x2x2x2 and a friendly new personal restriction of i'm now not doing anything that doesn't get below 20000 after 2/3/5 breakdown"

        "question": "can you teach us how to prime factorize numbers other than the basics (divisibility by 2, 3 and 5) and the \"left method\"?",
        "answer": "sure. there are many different levels of strategies. essentially what i do is, after breaking down the 2 3 and 5, then you're left with sort of an \"almost prime\" number. and then you have to check every prime number, starting with 7. The basis of the technique is, you are allowed to manipulate the target number (the 'almost prime' number) by multiples of the checker number (such as 7), in any way you want, and the target number will still retain its status of WHETHER OR NOT it is a multiple of 7. So for example, if your target is 6737, we can add or subtract 7 as many times as we want and IF 6737 was divisible by 7, any result you get from adding or subtracting 7s will ALSO be a multiple of 7. And similarly, if 6737 was NOT div by 7, it will retain its status as NOT being divisible by 7, no matter how many transformations you do. So it will retain its status of 7 or non7, no matter how many times you add/subtract 7s, OR divide by anything (as long as it stays a whole number). So that's the first guideline of the strategy, but that still doesn't sound too easy..... But the trick is this: your 'almost prime' number (target) that you're working with, it's always gonna end in 1,3,7, or 9. That's just the truth, if you've already gotten all the 2's and 5's out of it, it has to end in 1 3 7 or 9. WHICH MEANS, it is ALWAYS 1 or 3 away from a MULTIPLE OF 10. So, ..... what's also true, is, EVERY smaller prime number (the 'checkers' you'll use), also HAS to be 1 or 3 away from a multiple of 10. they simply all are, that's how prime numbers are. SO, here's what makes this work--- if your checker is 1 away from a mult of 10, for example, you can ALWAYS get it to switch to 3 away, if you triple it. And the other way around, if your checker is 3 away from a mult of 10, you can triple it and it ALWAYS switches to 1 away. SO...... therefore, you can always add or subtract the checker, OR its triple, to even it off to a mult of 10. And that result, will STILL be the same status for that factor, after the transformation, and you can easily drop the zero, and now the number has shrunk. and you keep doing that until you recognize it. So that's the starting point-- so for example, 6737 is your target, say you're checking 7, just subtract 7. and you have 6730, and you can drop the zero and have 673. And if 6737 was a multiple of 7, then 6730 has to be too, and 673 has to be too. Now you can do it again, you can add 7 and it's 680, drop the zero is 68, this i already know is NOT a multiple of 7 (i already recognize 68 as 17 times 4), but let's say you couldn't see that, you have some options... i can see 28 you could subtract from 68 to even it off, then you'd get 40 == 4, and i think you can easily see that 4 is NOT a multiple of 7, so by extension, you know the original number 6737 was ALSO not a multiple of 7, because we've only made legal transformations -- adding or subtracting only multiples of 7 or dividing (by anything). Going back to when we were at 68, you could also just divide by 2, get 34, and again, to get 17. which hopefully you can recognize as not a mult of 7, but in case you can't (??) you can subtract 7 you're left with 10, drop the zero is 1 == NOT 7. So 7 is ruled out. Then you would move on to 11. So 11 doesn't match right away, because 11 is 1-away (from 10) and 6737 is 3-away (from mult of 10). So you can triple 11 and automatically get it to fit: 33 is 3 away (from a mult of 10), so you can cleanly add it to 6737 to get 6770, drop the zero is 677. Now here you could go with 33 again, but if you know how 11 works you'll be able to spot 77 right away. And you can knock that right off, and you're left with 6, which you can easily recognize as NOT a multiple of 11, so by extension you know the target number was not a multiple of 11. This is the basis of the technique, but as you do it you learn new tricks all the time. You can also go from the left, which is sometimes even easier, but i'll wait until another time to explain the left mode although maybe you already know it. Some other tricks, which you'll find quickly, are like easier versions of some checkers which are also legal but amazingly simple to see. For example, for 29, if you need it to be 3 away, but 87 is too ugly for some reason, you can use 203. 203 is a legit multiple of 29, and it's usually easier to use than 87-- unless your target already has 87 visibly very obviously. 301 is a great one for 43. 901 is great for 53. 1003 is great for 59. Another great trick is to use 2001 for both 23 AND 29. ever since i discovered that i use it every time, because it knocks out 2 numbers at once. 1001 can also be used for 7,11, and 13, but i'm not sure if that's ever actually eaiser, because 7 11 and 13 are all so small that they usually breeze right by. Often in the early stages, you can knock off 2 numbers at once, for example if your target is 1911, ... you can knock off 11 and get 19, and knock off 19 and get 11... since 11 and 19 are both there together it is clear that they're not compatible with each other, so you can knock both of them off. Another important thing to remember, is that as the checkers get higher, the likelyhood that you'll find a match decreases. So you are the most likely to find a match with 7, 11, 13, etc and as you get higher it gets less and less likely, and more likely your target is prime. So it's kind of anti climactic in that way. I guess you could do it the other way around, but it would tend to take much more time because you would be looking in unlikely places first. And the other very important thing to remember, is how to know when to stop -- and you know this from square roots. you can estimate usually. If you check all the checkers in order, and you don't find a match, you never have to go any higher than the square root of the target. The reason for this, is that let's say... for example with 6737, for that target you should only have to check checkers up to the sq root of 6737. You can approximate that if you know 64 as 8 squared. you can estimate that 80 squared is 6400 (basically just do it without the zeros, and know that the zeros on the square number should be twice as many). So 80 squared is 6400, and 90 squared should be 8100. So, 6737 is somewhere in between, probably closer to 80 sq, so you know that 83 squared is about as high as you'll have to go, and 89 is already way over. So you only have to go to 89. and the reason you know this is because, let's say, you've checked all the checkers UP TO 83 already, and not found a match. Well, IF you checked 89, and found a match, what would its partner be? in other words, 89 times SOMETHING would have to be 6737.... but that's impossible, because we already know that 83 times 83 is LESS, so for 89 times something to be MORE than 6737, you'd need the other multiplier to be LESS than 83, but that's impossible because you already checked everything. So IF you checked everything and haven't made a mistake, then you should be totally sure that the target is prime by the time you reach approximately the square root of it. So just to quickly knock this one out so i can see if there are any other surprises to show you, we were at 13, so 6737, add 13 is 6750, drop the zero is 675, when it gets to a 5 you can go with a mult of 13 that works with 5 (such as 65) or if it's easier you could double 675 and knock off a zero (that would be the same as dividing by 5). Or on this one you could just divide by 25 if that is easier for you... but let's say you wanna just subtract 65, so that's 61 and def not a mult of 13 (mult of 13 would be 65 of course) so 13 is out. So 6737, checking 17, easily subtract 17, you get 672. And at any point, if the number looks hella even, just go ahead and divide by 2 if you want. The more parts of the number look even, the easier it is. in this case you'd wanna look at it like 6 72. and just cut each in half, hopefully you'd recognize 72 going in half to 36. so 6 72 would be 3 36. Now 336, can effortlessly be divided by 3, because the digits discretely and exclusively are all multiples of 3. so 112, which i know as 7 mixed with 2's etc, but just cut it in half a few times and you'll see it (no 17). SO.... 6737 checking 19, well, subtract the triple (57), or i might as well say the left method, i see 67 all the way on the left, and you can swap that out for 10 because 57 is 10 under it. This left method follows different rules so i didnt wanna say it just yet, but it's always good to have a second option...so you swap out 6737 to 1037, ... then if you know 95 (19x5) you can do another left swap, swapping 103 out for 8 (it works with any number of consecutive digits from the left), so you can swap 103 for 8 because 95 is hiding just 8 under 103. so from 1037, replace the 103 with 8, so now you have 87. If you didn't recognize that as 29x3, then you could subtract 57 (19's triple) to get 30 and clearly is not 19. so 19 is out. 6737, just add 23, is 676, divide by 2, if you group it like 6 76 you should be able to see it, if you are familiar with 76 going to 38, you'd get 3 38. ... 338. Or, if you dont like that you can just stick with 676 and work 23 with it, using its DOUBLE, 46, subtract 46 from 676 and get 63, which might be known as 7x9 or even easier you'll know you can't have another 23 multiple ending in 3 anywhere near here. Or if you had stuck with 338 from before, divide again nah fuck it it's got 2 odd numbers in it. Numbers get harder to cut in half the more consecutive odd numbers they have. So anyway 23 is out. 6737, checking 29, my trick is 203, ... add it, .. get 6940, drop the zero, 694. divide by 2, grouping as 6 94 because i know 94 -- so that's 3 47.... 347. add 203 again because it fits, is 550 , drop zero is 55 clearly just in 11 land so 29 is out. 6737, doing 31, doesn't fit so triple it, which is 93 which is pretty easy if you just think of it as 100 and delete the 7... so 683. then subt 93, 590, 59, i know 59 as prime, or maybe you'd know 62 as 31 which is close so you know it's not it. 31 out. 6737, well that's just too easy, knock off 37, you get 67. so you can knock off both 67 and 37, if you can remember that by the time you get to 67. ok 6737, so checking 41 you may have to triple. it's 123. What i sometimes do is first get whether you're gonna add or subt, then just level everything off first, then do the add/subt.. So you know youre gonna add, then think of 123 as 12, and think of 6737 as 674. 674 plus 12 is 686. div by 2 easliy with discrete digits, is 343. you'll be subtracting 123, they both have 3s at the end so just ditch them first then do it, so it's 34 minus 12, clearly NOT your checker number (41) so it's good to know where you're going because you can totally skip the details on 34 minus 12 cuz you know it will never be a multiple of 41. Next is 43, add it to 6737 is 678, div by 2, hopefully you know 78 in 13 land, goes to 39, so 678 div by 2 is 3 39. 339 div by 3, discretely breaks down by digit easily to 113. Already know that's prime, but in case you don't, just subtract 43 and you already know that's gonna even off to a 1 digit number, so you dont even have to even bother thinking of it. 43 is out. 6737, next checker is 47 -- At some point you'll have to start checking the checkers, as they get too high for you to already know them, for me that doesn't really happen until around 320, that's probably because i've been working on doing everything from 99999 downwards as a sleeping technique, which puts the square root somewhere around 320, so i'm pretty familiar with everything up to 320 by now, ... so anyway, checking 47, in 6737, subt 47 is 669, easily div by 3 is 223, subt 43 again evens off to 18 so no. 6737, next is 53, add it, is 679, you'll need to triple 53 to use 159, but i personally hate that and i found 901 works instead for 53, so 679 plus 901 is 1580, 158, div by 2 is 79, which i know as prime, but if you don't, it's clearly recognizable as not a multiple of 53 because 53x2 is obviously already over 100. so 53 is out. 6737, next would be 59, so you'd have to either triple it, or use the trick i found which is 1003. so that makes 7740, to 774, now here, you could probably divide by 2 reasonably easily, but i just hate dealing with odd digits so much that i'd probably rather just take 1003 and double it and use that. so you can add 2006 to 774 pretty easily,.... 2774 then 2780. so 278. divide by 2 is 139, which i know as prime, but if you don't have that, you can just subtract your checker (59) and in fact, if you are too lazy to calculate 139-59 (i know i'd rather not) you really don't have to, i think there are multiple ways you can automatically know that it's not gonna be 59. the last digit is gonna be zero for sure. also 139 is loosely in the realm of 2x59 but it would have to be even for that to work. there's always little contextual tricks you can find to escape the pain of doing awkward calculations. so 59 is out. So next is 61, in 6737, i hate using 61's triple, so i'd go from the left-- looking at 67 you can see 61 is nearby under it -- by the way this left trick only works when you see the checker UNDER some string on the left, not over. i mean you could do it with over too but the math would be much uglier. so swap 67 for 6, and it's 637. then again easily from the left, replace the 63 with 2, so 27. so no. Next is 67, just knock it right off. 71, 71 is kind of ugly, the triple is decent, it's 213, so 6737 plus 213 is 695. times 2 is 139. and the checker was 71, well, in that range, 139 is in the right range to be a double of 71, but it's not even, so it can't be a double. So you can rule it out that way. sometimes if you step back you can see the obvious. in a way, as the numbers get larger, sometimes it's actually easier to recognize obviously when something is NOT a multiple of them, beccause there are fewer numbers that ARE, and you can narrow it down based on characteristics (ending digit) or range. So, 6737, checking 73... add it... not fun.. but it will end in 1 (this is from knowing 73+27 as a pair)... so 681. that's just 127x3, so no. checking 79, this one really sucks. This is one of the most miserable ones if you need a triple. i always get 237 and 267 confused. But, it's 237. so that actually fits quite easily with 6737. it's gonna go to 65, so that's out. Now we're at 83, which is really approximately the square root of 6737. so if 83 works, it would HAVE to be a square, because it can't pair with anything higher than 83 or else it would go way above 6737. And actually you can tell it won't be 83 squared, because 83 squared has to end in 9, and 6737 does not. But, it's good to check anyway because if you made a mistake on ANYTHING up to this point, then you could be looking at higher numbers, to pair with whatever lower one you missed. so to check 83 just in case, 6737, gotta add it... level it first... 8 plus 674. is 682. in half is 341. You can probably get this easily from range, but i will add the triple, 249, which is easy for me to remember, so like 34 plus 25 is ... urg, see that right there is just unnecessarily hard for me. but look, it's not gonna be nearly as big as 83. so without even doing 34 plus 25 you can still see that it's definitely not 83. so therefore it's ruled out. So that rules out everything, so 6737 is prime. however, let's say it was 6713, and you had found a match, 7? 672 yes i see it, minus 42 is 630 is 63, so then you have a match, so you have to work backwards, so 63 would be 9 (x7) so you have 9, so then it was 672, so that was plus 42 which in terms of 7s is 6. (6x7=42). so you had 9, then 6. but the 6 is in the next digit so it's 96. then from 672 it was 7 under that-- i should clarify... we're adding digits, so it's 6720, and 6713 was 7 under that. You basically have to retrace your steps from how you found the match. so it would be 960, but 1 under that. so 959. Then, after you've found that match, and divided it out, (and hopefully remembered that you have already taken 7 out), then you keep checking in THAT number (959), as the new target number, and you keep going through the checkers from where you left off, BUT you have to check the same checker again. Because it may have 7 in it twice. You don't have to check anything lower, because you've already DIS proved those, but just because you found a match at 7 still doesn't disprove the possibility of finding MORE 7s. so you have to keep checking the same one to make sure it's not a double or even triple match (7x7x7, etc). So, 959, i can easily see 49 being easy to subtract, that's 91, which i happen to know is 13x7, but if you didn't know that you could clearly see it by subtracting 21 and getting the match that way (70, =7). So working with 91, knowing that's 7x13, we express it all in terms of 7s, so that's 13, ... then what next, .. it was 959, so you have to add 7 (7x7) to 13, BUT in the next digit, ... so 137. So basically 137 is where we are after finding and removing 2 matches, both 7s, from the original target number. so in otherwords, we've discovered that the target number (6737) divided by 7, twice, is 137. i already know that's prime, but if you didn't, then you can subtract 7 again, get 13, knock out 7, and keep checking, which will be over very quickly because with 137, you only have to check up to 12 (12 squared is 144, already too high). So that leaves only 1 checker left, so you'd check 11, do it from the left, swap 13 with 2, and it's 27, clearly not a mult of 11. So if you can remember the breakdown, that would be 137x7x7. Hope that helps. It can be important to set boundaries also with this, i typically only use it as a sleep exercise, or, if i happen to be stuck waiting in line somewhere or stranded somewhere where i have absolutely no tangible ability to work on anything else (which pretty much would only occur in a scenario where i am incapable of writing anything down).... it's important to set boundaries because this is probably not a very useful endeavor otherwise, especially with the availability of calculators. But it is a decent brain exercise in problem solving, in some ways, and it can be calming"

        "answer": "holy school picture re-take day, you are very friendly for someone in your situation, i can think of 2 things to suggest. 1, try using words some how. Music can escalate the power of words, immensely. and words can escalate the power of music, immensely. Sometimes without one or the other, things can be aimless. If you don't want to use words, then you could try using a picture. Music also can do just fine when it's being used to enhance a picture. Music and non-music are a match forged deep within the origins of the universe. And the other thing i would recommend, specifically if you think you have a fine grasp on what notes and chords are gonna sound like, grab some staff paper and go to a room, a library is good because you have no access to an instrument, but i dunno if there's any real libraries nowadays, but just somewhere where you are sequestered with no access to instrument. just your mind, and paper. and a singular pitch reference is ok, but come on, you can remember your favorite songs well enough to snag an absolute pitch right? or maybe there's an elevator bell in the room that you can learn. Anyway, absolute is not even important here really. try to use words too. Write the lead sheet, with melody and chords, lyrics, the whole thing. As long as you are comfortable that you have the ability to know what it sounds like without using an instrument, which i suspect you do, the idea of writing a song entirely like that, just in your mind, and writing it down immediately on paper into finality, it can make you feel kinda powerful and also desperately insane, which is always good for writing"

        "question": "people don't incentivize reading nearly as much as they should. they always say to \"read more\", but I find it almost unnecessary to read blocks of text that reveal the stories of others by making your eyes tired. how are you supposed to become smarter just by reading the stories of others, regardless of whether or not the story is legitimately interesting? like wow, I just have my brain expand a thousandfold by reading about a story that is completely irrelevant to my life. also, I find it difficult to maintain a well enough retention rate to \"absorb\" information in any piece of literature, as the education system's propaganda always expects us to do. and with my many years in participating in the education system, I have yet to acquire the proper \"Lexile score\" for my grade simply because the most incentive teachers give out would be to have my Lexile score be higher and just showing the results of reading a lot. hell, my grammar is terrible simply because schools, after all of their propaganda, have failed to give me enough valid reasoning for me to actively learn. but I am aware that reading is important, especially outside of the school circle. but the most you are supposed to do in school is to listen to the teacher and drain yourself of any critical and creative thinking abilities. those tasks don't require any book reading. so I should embark on a quest to find more reasons as to why I should read. do you have any better reasons as to why I should read? you seem like someone who has found out why",
        "answer": "well..... on this page for example, if i didn't read i wouldn't know what your question was. and if you don't read, you're not gonna find out what my answer is. also not reading would make browsing the internet pretty difficult"

        "question": "Hey Bill, I've been trying my hand at writing as of late, and I have all these great ideas for characters and character interactions, but I just can't seem to connect them all to the over-arching plot. Have you ever written any stories, and if so do you have any advice on how to bring them to fruition?",
        "answer": "there is a common debate about whether you should try to think of the plot ('outline') before you write. as i am foraying more deeply into this issue, i am rapidly forming stronger opinions than i thought, in favor of the non-outline. Believe me, i've been trapped in a corner with no plot many times before, as can clearly be seen in my infantile attempts over the past few years, which is what makes me feel pressure to outline (i recall hitting a point of desperation somewhere over the Andes mountains). I think you will find some writers have to outline, some writers think you're supposed to outline, some writers are very good at outlining, sometimes it almost feels like most people assume you are supposed to outline. But ... there are some people who say when they outline it ruins it. Some people say they are hired to write stories, and they are required to do an outline, so they have to fake the outline, either by making a fake outline first and then ignoring it when they write the real thing, (and the bosses usually forget), or, by just writing the whole story first and then making a fake outline based on how the story actually turned out. Many many professional writers insist that you have to outline in order to get anywhere, and that seems true.... and i want to believe this......... but i keep having these realizations which put me further and further toward the non-outline side of the spectrum. here's an example, which i may or may not agree with in a few years from now, but i was noticing something: when i watch movies/films (like the kind you would see in the cinema back when that was a thing), the majority of those that i've seen, when i watch them for the first time, ......... extremely often i have no earthly idea what's going on for at least the first 30 minutes. The scenes may be great, and i am perfectly keen to enjoy great scenes and dialogue like music, even if i don't actually have any idea who these people are or what they're talking about, but still... somehow, in most of these cases, i just... think we're supposed to know what's going on. I think the writer assumes that it's more intelligible than it is.... because they think they've left enough clues as to what's going on. I don't know if i'm the only one, it could be just some kind of brain disfunction, but most movies seem to act like i'm supposed to know what the hell is going on, even though i don't. (again, this does not usually detract from the aesthetics of the scene and music of the dialogue, but somehow i still think we're probably supposed to know what's going on, at least slightly) Again, i may just be stupid, but i've noticed that if i see the movie for the second time, THEN it obviously works out perfectly, and everything is great and makes sense and thrives fully well......... because i have already watched the movie an entire time so i know what's going on. Maybe you see where i'm going with this................. suddenly i had a shocking realization. and you may disagree with this, and who knows, i may disagree with it later, but it seems perfectly clear to me currently..... which is that All these scenes are designed by someone who already knows what's going to happen. that's why it makes no sense to someone who doesn't know yet. And suddenly it occured to me that what MUST be done (at least on my watch, if i am writing) it became quite clear to me that the only fair way to actually avoid this problem is for the writer to actually not know what's going to happen. that seems like the most effective way for the writer and the reader to actually be on the same page and to enjoy and understand the same things. I'm sure there's other ways around this, but if you are asking me at this point i would say i'm leaning heavily toward the free side of the spectrum. that being said, i'm sure you are aware that i've had some blunders attempting to be on that side of the spectrum (exclusively blunders, for the most part, aside from times i resorted to non-fiction) but in my case i think the trick around that might be something as simple as having more than 1 character. which i strangely never really tried before, so we'll see what happens"

Record yourself singing the tempo through the transitions, and then use them to calibrate the transitions, and line the clicks up to that. after having picked the tempos you want, and recording them both and then moving them into place. but it is much more likely that your sequencer can do tempo changes"

        "answer": "i think if you write more music while you are awake, that will probably help not really a lot of times when you get a song from your dreams, it's either way too boring or already exists, or both. Or, often there is too much to capture in time. so it's not a very reliable way of getting material. you're going to have to work on it while you are awake too"

        "question": "how did you get the original inspiration for \"got to know what's going on\"? (love that song by the way)",
        "answer": "i think we all just want to understand how the world really works, and what is really going on, and what everything is and means. i came up with the first line of the chorus, and many others, many years before i would have had the courage to take care of the entire songwriting, especially because dealing with a song where you only know the chorus, and then figuring out what comes before, is a very weird puzzle that i didn't learn how to do until years later. in fact i didn't even really have the courage to finish the chorus either, until years later. it was quite common for me to come up with quite normal sounding hooks and not know what to do with them, and back then (around 2010) my only strategy was to start at the beginning and go bonkers, from beginning to end. but there were many chorus-sounding figures that were generated at that time, such as 'i'm sad', 'i wanna go home', etc, which i didn't really know how to deal with. As of june 2017, recording songs regularly, my selection process was brute force random-number selection -- no pre-selection, no semi-finals, just get a randomly generated number out of 400 (or however many items there were in the list at the time) and you absolutely have to pick that one, no matter what it is. So that one came up and was still just a 1 line figure. so that's when the rest of it was written"

        "answer": "that's not really the reason for notation. mostly the reason for notation is to communicate with other musicians. Figuring out why things sound good is a whole different endeavor, which is impossible but also fun i think you should start using numbers instead of letters, so they always represent the same thing relative to the song. this is probably a better representation of how the music actually goes, and sounds. And most musicians do understand it, so you can communicate that way too. i believe the entire city of nashville was built on numbers, if i recall"

        "answer": "it's really quite simple. songs. listen to songs, make your own songs, ..... a general rule, if it's not a song, it didn't happen"

        "question": "Hey bill if you wanna make your life easier when it comes to figuring out if something is a multiple of 7, there's a convenient way to use your subtract/add a multiple of 7 trick that makes it much easier. Say your number is 30583 for example. Now we know that 21 is a multiple of 7 right? That means anything times 21 is also a multiple of 7. So what we can do is just subtract the number by 21 times the last digit of the number, in this case 3. So 21*3=63 which means we can do 30583-63->30520 then divide by 10 to get 3052. Then repeat. 3052-42->3010->301 301-21->280->28 which is divisible by 7 which means 30583 is divisible by 7. Now whenever we are subtracting by 21 times the last digit and then dividing by 10, what we are essentially doing is taking the last digit, doubling it, then subtracting the rest of the number by t he doubl ed last digit. So like instead of doing 30583-63->30520->3058 what you can instead do is a short cut for 30583 and take the last digit 3, double it to get 6, and then subtract the rest of the number by that doubled digit, 3058-6->3052, and then just keep subtracting the rest of the number by the last digit doubled until you get to a number you know is divisible by 7.",

        "question": "Hey Bill, I really enjoy how unique your writing is, and the one man show type deal is so intriguing to me because of how much personal freedom and creativity it allows. After much pondering I've decided to give it a try on my own. I play several winds, strings, and drums decently well but have no experience in production whatsoever. Was thinking maybe getting my music out on YouTube. Any thoughts, ideas, or tips on learning production? (Btw I've chosen reaper for a DAW, because people said it's good and it's nice to trust them) thanks!",
        "answer": "yes what i would recommend, in this case, and forgive me if you've heard me say this 10,000 times before, which i have, but my best advice for this situation which i recommend strongly is to start with extremely short pieces of music. Extremely short. like 3 seconds or less. because producing your own music from scratch is about as complicated as building a finished house that is ready for move-in. there are so many things and different categories of work and different departments you have to deal with, it seems impossible to learn to do all that stuff. Unless, your song was so absurdly short that it was literally impossible not to finish it"

        "question": "How do I focus on making songs when every time I try and focus it feels like my body is acclimating to poison. Is it ever possible to truly just sit down and induce it?",
        "answer": "hm, i'm wondering where you are in your relationship to the desire to do songwriting. in other words, why are do you want to write songs, has it ever happened before, etc.. For example, if it's the case the songs tend to throw themselves at you when you are least expecting, but yet you can't seem to 'induce' them, i can understand that and i have various things to suggest. If you've seemingly never had song ideas before of any kind, then i might recommend something different, and again would want to know more about your relationship to the desire of songwriting. And depending on your level of music experience vs word writing experience, i might recommend freestyling a lot in text-editors, or if your word writing experience is ahead of your music, then i might recommend improvising a lot on a chordal instrument, possibly while singing, there are all kinds of things which i might suggest depending on your background and how you have progressed so far"

        "answer": "yes, but i think i missed the perfect opportunity. this is kind of a long story but hopefully you can follow... one time i was driving through a mandatory sobriety check point. they looked at my license and asked me to say the alphabet. But i've heard so many stories about police asking you to say the alphabet BACKWARDS, that in my mind i thought that's what they said. And it just so happens that as a child i familiarized myself with a fully functional version of the common ABC song, with backwards lyrics, so the alphabet is in reverse. So i have the backwards alphabet very readily commited to memory. So i started blasting through the backwards alphabet (not in song, just spoken) and i already got to about Q when he said 'whoa whoa whoa, no, forwards.' and he probably thought i was crazy. Everything worked out fine, but unfortunately i missed the opportunity to simply press play on the CD in the CD player, which happened to be a test mix of my 'Alphabet Shuffle' song, which i had been listening to moments before. i understand this story would have been better if i had actually done it, but for some reason it didn't seem like a good idea at the time"

        "answer": "here's what i would recommend, based on similar long term problems i've had, and the best solution that has emerged. it's a hybrid randomization scheme. First, put all the items in a list. 2 different approaches come to mind- 1: using complete randomization to pick (computer generated random selection), but this might end up picking one that you actually don't really want to do. 2: 'just picking the one you want' clearly doesn't work, otherwise you wouldn't be in this situation. So i've found a hybrid system: the way it works is, first you go through the list and choose ones that you think are reasonable choices -- it's ok to pick as many as you want. Add these to a finalists list. then, immediately as soon as you finish making that list, do a random selection based on that new list. And that's your selection. If you don't end up choosing any for the finalists list, then go ahead and just do the random selection on the original list. i hope this helps. i think it is a solid system and it works for me, even in the face of extreme decision anxiety"

I find it easy enough to draw the rest of the body as body language doesn't need as much careful consideration, but faces really make me struggle as even the slightest detail changes the observed expression drastically. All of my characters look like they've had their soul vacuumed out by the ghost-busters leaving their faces stiff and without emotion. I've tried a lot of things but none of the satanic rituals worked. So tell me, which ritual did you use to imbue souls into your music without attracting any evil spirits or accidentally haunting the music???",

        "question": "When a human being or other creature with opposable thumbs strums a guitar or similarly-shaped, differently-sized instrument, it's generally taught that their dominant hand is meant to be pressing down on the strings over the frets while their non-dominant hand strums the strings further down the body of the guitar. Wouldn't playing guitar be more effective if the musician was carefully constructing chords with their dominant hand while strumming with their non-dominant hand? I ask because I learned how to play a 'non-dominant hand' guitar and then a 'dominant hand' guitar upside-down and I am wondering if it is too late for me to change my ways. Also, if someone is ambidextrous, how do they pick which hand does what??",
        "answer": "i'm quite sure it could be learned either way how late is it you'll probably play whatever instrument you have. and if you literally have exactly equal choice between the two, then you would probably weigh the advantages and disadvantages, some of which might be: right handed instruments will usually be easier to find. playing lefty will look more unique. playing the opposite way of the way the instrument was intended may make your playing very unique, yet that will also possibly create some slight blockades in communication when discussing playing technique with others who don't also play backwards"

What this does is it taunts the music gods, provokes them, and they will try to get their revenge by making the music good anyway. And you will see that the path it takes FROM that horrendous place, back to a more familiar place, will be very interesting, and still quite different from most things you've heard, while still being good"

        "question": "Hey I want to make music. I already do, I've been for years, but I suck at all musical instruments I've tried at (for years), and at making music too. I'm very stressed by my personal and education stuff and as a result I always feel tired, leaving me with no energy to focus on any instrument enough to actually improve. Usually I play whatever I feel like, mess around which can be fun but on non-polyphonic instruments gets boring quickly. Also I suspect that this way I'm discouraged from trying new things (because in the beginning they won't be fun, as I will fail at them over and over again), so I don't improve. As you see I'm kinda desperate, but that desperation isn't good enough of a fuel: I've attempted a serious approach, playing exercises from a book everyday but after a month the results were scarce, then I was forced to slow down and now I'm back at the beginning again. Back at pointless wankery too. I don't really believe I'm gonna make it anymore. I'm thinking of quitting, and not just music. But that's just awful and I can't. I'm stuck, I don't know what to do. I've written folk tales, that didn't help. Maybe I should do something else, but at this point I've given too much to let go, and anyway if I'm this obsessed it's because I've had fun sometines, both listening, making and playing music. But it seems emotions vanish when I need them the most",
        "answer": "ah yes, i could see that i'd say you won't even know how fun the game can be until you get some chords into your life SOMEHOW ah, right. you are seeing the mischievous nature of music. (well, not just music, ........ sometimes it seems almost everything in the world is that way, but that's another story). You could think of it like a playful pet, or friend. it honestly really likes you. you just have to be gentle and friendly with it. it will find you anyway. might even be fun to try to ignore it for a second and see if it comes bounding back clamoring for your attention"

        "answer": "very fast. i had just snapped and said 'i'm going to do these music videos in 2 weeks even though i know it always takes 10 weeks no matter how hard i try to make it 2 weeks or even 4 weeks, but now i'm desperate, it's gonna be 2 weeks or die trying', and so there was no time to waste. and on the selection, i seemed to hate everything (as usual), so because the time was so limited, part of my brain just said 'what song do you wish you could do' (like one that doesn't exist yet), and the first 2 lines wrote themself. So that was the starting point, then i began writing it, and i think after the whole day i still really had barely even wrapped up the first 2 stanzas. not good, because there's only 14 days to do the whole process, ..... write, record everything, all everything, video, ..... entire everything. So i took a panic walk and slapped myself into shape and realized if i can't finish this in the next 4 hours then i'm off the bus pretty much. So basically the first thing that was written after the switch into panic mode was the 'i saw the sign' bit. i think it's evident that this wouldn't have made it into the song if i had had time to think. but in fact, it's this line that is the gateway to the entire mindset of the rest of the song. it sends it off a sort of cliff, and a series of strange things unfold, and due to momentum, when we finally land at the 'outchorus' ('do everything'.... etc), the real-world emotion of the actual scenario seems to realize itself more fully and genuinely, and the song is definitely about itself, as you can see the victory set in towards the end, and yet also admitting how it had seemed like the end of the world just moments ago which i narrowly escaped"

(only tried this with 2-note \"chords\", though.) do you know any other secret tricks?",

        "question": "Hey Bill, do you agree with me that we should switch to ternary numeral system (base 3)? There are some good reasons for that: - Computers should ideally be in base 3 for maximum efficiency. - Calculators would also work slightly quicker in ternary system due to the fact that addition in computers are closely related to \"e\", Euler's constant, approximately equal to 2.718281828. 3 is slightly close to e than 2, so ternary system would also be faster for addition. - Last but not least, according to Bill Wurtz, an intellectual, \"two plus two has been four for so many darn years\". This does indicate that intellectuals are tired of having four as the expected result for two plus two. If we were to use binary, then two won't even exist; but to use ternary, two plus two won't be four anymore; instead it would be 11 (base 3). So conclusion, do you agree with me?",
        "answer": "no you can just switch the computers. computers already work in base 2 which is already different from the way people use numbers usually yes you can switch the calculators too, and then translate back to 10 you can't take lyrics out of context of the song. they might not mean the way they meant in the song then Why is that whole song and most of my other songs in 4/4 time signature, which is literally a celebration of 2+2 being 4 no"

(in the past maybe,) are actually non-music jobs, when they used to care about a degree. i don't actually even know what a degree is so maybe i'm wrong about this anyway but i'm pretty sure it's nothing and becomes even more nothing with each passing day"

        "question": "Hi Bill! I love your music and also I've read a few of these questions and your music advice seems really solid. My question is, do you have any advice for understanding how time signatures work? I'm new to music theory and having a hard time getting my head around this particular concept.",
        "answer": "first get a metronome. that's just like a 'clicker'. just download one and you'll see what i mean. it just makes a constant click. and you can set the speed (tempo). ok now turn it off, and listen to some songs. see if you can find the 'beat', in those songs. the 'beat' is like the steady click, and most songs have it, all the way through. it is what people 'tap their foot' to, or, i think a couple days ago someone accused me of 'nodding my head' up and down while playing music. that would be the same thing. listen to every song you know and see if you can find this pulse. for most songs, it goes all the way through. But, .... there's more.... What if i told you that these beats could be organized in groups of 2. So imagine if you're hearing the steady click, but you're seeing a flash of light on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, (althernating) clicks. i hope this is making sense so far. or maybe just every alternating click is louder. so like, CLICK click CLICK click CLICK click. it might not actually be louder in the music, but it feels like a miniature starting place, every 2 clicks. it's hard to explain, i just realized. i've been familiar with this probabaly since before i could speak language, so i hope it's something you can get because i actually just realized i have no way of explaining it. Also, just to make sure we're on the same page, try to make sure the tempo is usually somewhere between 70 and 140 -- just listen to those tempos on your metronome to get an idea of roughly the speeds i'm talking about, so when you listen to songs, you can find the beat in that range (not like doubled or quadrupled or something). So as you listen to songs, try to ask yourself, can you feel the clicks, and can you also feel how one out of every 2 clicks seems to feel like the dominant one. Hopefully this is making sense. it's much easier to actually demonstrate than to explain in only words. So i think you'll find that almost every song you can find, has these beats, in groups of 2 like this. Well, if you take it a step further, you will find that these groups of 2 also seem to come in groups of 2. so that makes groups of 4 clicks. see if you can listen to some songs and see if you can find the beat, and see if you can hear which one is the first of the group of 4. see if you can hear it in groups of 4. at least 90% of all songs in the world will use this 4 pattern. This means that the timesignature of the song is 4. actually on paper this is written with two 4s on top of each other, but that's not really that important. the time signature is called \"4 4\", pronounced \"four four\". but in actual reality you can just say the song is \"in 4\". and literally every musician on the planet will know exactly what you mean. Most songs are in 4, kind of like most cars have 4 wheels, and most people walk in a repeating 2 pattern (which, when superimposed on itself at halfspeed, creates 4, which is exactly the way it occurs in music). It's just a natural property of nature that music tends to operate this way also. a \"bar\" is just 4 beats. so if a song has a time signature of 4 (or \"four four\", again, it's sort of a long boring historic story as to why it's called that), it means there are 4 beats in a bar. Most music is like this, for most of the time. But, a LOT of songs, ESPECIALLY when transitioning between sections, like going from the verse to the chorus, or from the chorus to the verse, may break this pattern momentarily, in between sections. This is normal. It's like that left-right walking pattern -- it gets interrupted when you get onto your bike, but then while you are on the bike the pattern is back to normal. and then it gets weird again for 1 or 2 steps as you get off the bike. This technically means the time signature changed (to maybe 1, or 5, or whatever you need) just for that one moment when you got off the bike. This again is natural in nature, for patterns to occasionally need to break in order to pass from one scenario to the next. More rarely, you might occasionally find songs that actually seem to consistently have 3 beats per bar. This means the time signature is 3, or, traditionally on paper this is written as 3 4 (the 3 is written directly above the 4, and it's pronounced \"three four\"). Again, it's kind of a long boring historic story as to why the 4 is written under there, but it's the top number that really tells you how many beats per bar. But if you imagine the tempo differently, you might not need to write it in 3. for example, if it's 3 very quick beats, you might even imagine them all as just 1 beat. and guess what ....... those big 1 beats are definitely going to usually come in groups of 4. so either the time signature is 4 (and the tempo is slow) and the beats happen to be broken in groups of 3 (those would be called 'triplets') OR, you can say it's in a time signature of 3, and the beats go by 3 times quicker ('tempo' would be therefore be 3 times faster on paper), and you are hearing groups of 4 ENTIRE BARS. ..... Now, here's the thing, ... when you're learning about time signatures, it's going to be tempting to ask 'well what would happen if there was a weirder grouping like 5, 7, or 11.' Well, this is ok, and it's a fun question to ask, but there is diminishing effectiveness as the numbers get weirder, although it's tempting to think that's a good idea while you are learning, because your brain is focused on it. However, it still remains true that these weird numbers are very commonly used MOMENTARILY, like when going from one section to the next. Or, just, if you have a special lyric in there that needs more or less time. Music lives and dies by the element of surprise, so this will be necessary. But when it comes to keeping a steady time signature for a long period of time, you will find that 4 will be it, at least 90% of the time. about 8% of the time it will be 3, but again it's always debatable whether it's actually just a slow 4 with triplets in each beat. Less than 1%, you may actually find a consistent 5. and in at least half of those cases of 5, the number 5 will actually be in the title of the song, because as i said, it's usually a very deliberate mental exercise. This is increasingly true as you start to use larger prime numbers (7, 11, 13, etc), and if you see those used steadily over the course of long periods of time (such as an entire song) it becomes increasingly likely that the composer wants you to know they are thinking about the time signature. as tempting and fun as it is, to dwell on these scenarios for the sake of learning, it also seems necessary to mention the significance and importance of '4' because we often overlook this, if we become 'interested' in time signatures, which you may have, based on your question. Now, you may think, 'well, are you saying that we should strive to be boring and normal', and the answer is no. but in the greater scheme of things, if you're gonna be free then probably wouldn't even want to restrict yourself to a time signature at all. so, weirdly, doing a song in 7 and staying in 7 is actually more restrictive than just keeping it in 4...... Four is usually what happens when you are not trying to actively focus on the time signature, AND, what i would like to mention again is that very often you get deviations from this, but NOT in a way that stays that way constantly -- it will be usually just when you need to get from one place to the next. so it's almost not even fair to count that as a 'different time signature', and in many of those cases it's literally not a different time signature because the tempo pauses itself completely for an undefined amount of time. i would estimate that this may happen in at least 30% of all songs, very broadly speaking. in conclusion, the time signature is usually 4, but i don't necessarily expect you to believe me at this point"

The previous graphics department is gone, there was no escaping that. so something will have to replace it, and in my usual style i said \"HOW ABOUT MAKING IT 1,00000,000000 TIMES MORE BETTER\" and then spending many many very dedicated and dilligent months trying to evolve that properly into existence, and then, again, in my typical style, suddenly a wall of panic comes over me and i scramble into action, in any way possible. i've made some absolutely massive developments in that time, particularly in terms of the general process by which i use the computer. and the graphics department is literally in a whole new world. so it's the beginning of a brand new game, for sure. if i had to predict, i would say that it's probably going to look simultaneously like i am both lightyears behind and lightyears ahead, of where i was before"

(something like a chess board would probably work best) if you have a chess board i would say start with just 5 pawns (all the same color). start putting the pieces onto the board in different configurations. i was gonna say write them down, but in the modern day, photograph them. just start putting the pieces on the board in different configurations and photograph them (write them down, or use camera, whichever you prefer). see if that helps"

        "question": "When I make music, I try and start with a melody. Then I tweak it and stuff. Then I start experimenting with it, and then I delete it and try something els, and then I get nothing done. I've been stuck in this stupid loop for months. How do I ever escape? Can I ever escape? How deep does the pit go? I guess I'll never know. Those sound like lyrics though. :)",
        "answer": "there is a certain phenomenon i've noticed, in these situations, and the phenomenon is called 'the first version is the best one you're gonna get'. i'll tell you the 2 most distinctive times i remember that being proven for me. the first day writing 'just did a bad thing', i made it through the 1st verse (double verse), through 'cancelled', and sing the connecting riff and suddenly land into this full 16 bar chorus, which fully came to me very quickly, which i was thrilled about, but it absolutely didn't seem to fit with the rest of the song (the 'bad thing' song). it was the entire 'hey, what's the name of this game' section, exactly how you hear it on the recording. that was what originally came, springing straight from that little connecting riff (after 'cancelled'). i was quite disappointed, i loved it but it just didn't seem to fit with that song. so i marked it down as 'hey what's the name of this game', as a different song, to be dealt with another time. Then i tried something totally different there. something about science or something, not anything sounding like the chorus as you know it. tried several different ideas for what could go after 'cancelled'. and by the end of the day, simply nothing was sticking. every attempt seemed to have less validity than the previous. i noticed this decrease in validity as the iterations wore on. so i knew there really was no choice but to return to the 'hey what's the name of this game' and trust that it can go in 'bad thing.' and i'm glad i did. and this is not the first time this has happened, it happens all the time. the most similar time i can think of is in 'sexy pants', almost exactly the same story, with the entire 16 bar thing at 'every day is such a lovely day' etc. that whole thing came very quickly, but i was disappointed to realize it really doesn't belong in that song, so i put it aside and tried to come up with the right thing but each attempt was increasingly more doubtable so i had really no choice but to go back to the first one. i've generally accepted this as a common princicple, that if you find yourself deleting and redoing something several times, you kind of have no choice but to just go with whichever version you thought of first. and just accept it as part of the thrill ride of songwriting, which sometimes is to be forced to work with crap. sometimes the best songwriting is when you think your partner or coworker has just handed you a piece of crap, and now you gotta make it work some how"

For example, if you found an apple in the kitchen drawer, and you said 'wow, that's a great apple'. and you get into this whole *apple* project about it. then, 12000000 years down the road, when you're working on the project and you feel a bit confused about the whole apple project, just think back to the original circumstance. and you may be surprised at what details you might have overlooked. such as, in this case, ......................................... the kitchen drawer"

        "answer": "just keep it in the list. i'm sure the idea takes up no more than 1mb max. sure bridge only is probably just about the hardest to work with. but, just play process of elimination. play 'what do we know.' gradually quiz yourself on things about the 'other part' (ANY other part) of the song. for example, does it live mostly on the 1 chord? is it a 4 first? maybe start asking yourself little questions about what should categorically be immediately before it. you will get an average of maybe 23% of an answer to each of these little questions. just keep asking the questions and you will gradually hone in on useful information. how about this: what should come after it. that will still get you close to figuring out everything else. Another general principle to remember is making patterns and breaking them. Whatever patterns are in the part you have, ask yourself what it would mean to break those patterns in the other part. or, this might be a slightly harder question, but what is a pattern such that your section (that you already have) would be good at breaking. Here's another even more scientific approach. just try putting things before it. then analyze exactly why you hated it so much, if at all. whether you liked any of them or hated any of them, with each one you will get just a bit more glimmer of information about what kinds of things are working and what is not"

I have a hard time breaking out of C major.",
        "answer": "that should work fine. Using different keys might enrich your brain in some ways, but it's not a deal breaker. similar to brushing your teeth with a different hand. it does enrich the brain to do this but, doing it with the same hand will not cause any harm"

        "answer": "yes. i will tell you my story, in context, so you can make your decision. i used to think it was better to put the desk against the wall, facing toward the wall, because it gives you more space in the room. but then, at some point, right around when i was facing one of the more severe brickwalls in my development as a writer, just 1 day after the really really dark day when i sort of made a declaration that this is impossible and i can't do this, i had a breakthrough and rearranged the desk, to be facing away from the wall. and this changed everything. i didn't expect this but it ended up being the magic key to everything. things seem to be better if the desk faces the generally toward the door (but is on the opposite side of the room). basically if you can imagine it as an office where people might come in to meet with you occasionally. for some reason that makes all the difference"

I normally have a kinda easy time creating the chords on the piano and then writing the lyrics, but what I have a problem with is adding more instruments/effects. I've tried using GarageBand before, but nothing else ever seems to go with my music, and I'm not sure if I'm just not good at music production (I kinda failed that class at school) or if my songs just shouldn't have any instruments besides piano, but my songs tend to get really boring after a while with no instruments. I've probably said a bit more than needed, but I was wondering... can you give me some tips on adding more effects and instruments to songs?",
        "answer": "i have an idea....... start with the shortest song you can imagine. start with a song that's only 1 second long, with only 1 word in it. you'll have plenty of time to try out everything imaginable, because it will barely take any time to try each thing. once you find some things that work, expand those techniques into a 2 word song. and so on"

Kind of like, the things you make are your attempt at making better and better mirrors so you can more clearly see the mental-image of \"the thing you want to make\". And through that process you consistently refine your style/personal taste of creativity. But through your refining process over time, it's still in the service of working toward refining that singular style. That's what it seems like to me, and if that isn't the case then my question might not be relatable to you, or my question might be too presumptuous.. anyway! My question is: do you ever get distracted by wanting to create something else (and how do you deal with that) OR do you try to incorporate that into refining the projects within the style you are already working on?

        "question": "any thoughts on your song In California? I think i read that it was made a little after history of the entire world, but it kinda has the early bill wurtz vibe",
        "answer": "yes here are my thoughts about it. it is an interesting case study in deadlines vs non deadlines, it's also an interesting case study in brute force randomized song selection, and it's also a good case study in making arrangement adjustments at the very last moment. deadlines vs non deadlines: i knew the entire time when i was making history of the world that i wanted to do songs constantly, forever, and i wanted to do this before history of the world, but history of the world became unexpectedly more important. so the entire time i had the idea that i was going to do songs next. so finally when i was done, i immediately jumped into the song. i had a general idea that i was going to use a weekly deadline, but i wasn't ready to do it quite yet. i wanted to take my time and do it 'right'. i got some good things, the initial groove/vamp sound was found then, and some other things, but after several days, maybe even a week, i felt everything slowing down, and i couldn't seem to make good decisions anymore. so i suddenly set a deadline and then demanded to do them weekly after that. Immediately after setting that deadline, i suddenly made a bunch of bold instrumental choices that wouldn't have been made otherwise. some of the percussion fills in the first verse, a lone loud bongo bonk, a hyper spaz hi-hat fill followed by a huge crash, if i remember correctly those are examples of decisions i made immediately after declaring being on a deadline. brute force randomized selection: usually if i try to select the next song without randomized assistance (like, actually choose which one i want to do) it's usually a downward spiral into rejecting everything. every song is too this or too that. too weak, too intense, too emotional, to dumb, too smart, too slow, too fast, too weird, too normal, etc etc. And i have no courage to take any risks. So the alternative to this is just getting a brute force random number. count all the songs in the list, (at this time it was something like 400), and get a computer generated random number from that range, and you MUST do that song. Well, i was willing to accept the result, but the problem here with the result (california) is that the song features a massive marijuana reference. This would be ok except for the fact that i had already had multiple marijuana references in songs before that. Ultimately i went forward with the selection because i felt like i had no other choice, but this highlights a problem with brute force random selection. Yes, it helps you avoid thinking EVERY song is 'wrong', but there's a weird fine line to reckon with because some songs ACTUALLY are 'wrong', considering the previous songs. For example, this song being about california, the following song (also chosen with brute force random) was called \"i love you\". Well, there is also a song in the list called \"California Love\" which has nothing to do with those other two. So, imagine for a moment, if \"California Love\" was picked next, after those other two. that would be terrible, it would look like an obvious deliberate themed connection, which it is not. fortunately the randomizer did not pick that, and the next 2 choices turned out ok. and since then i have developed a hybrid system that allows me to mostly rule out any of these problems before the randomized selection is made making arrangement changes at the last moment: usually, after the instrumental arrangement is done, and the vocals are done, and mixing is done, and i'm in the final troubleshooting stage, there can be an extreme resistence against going back and changing things in the arrangement. you just don't want to re-open what seems like a sealed box. but occasionally it has to be done, and i've learned that i MUST let myself be open to that. this song is a good example: those synth riffs in the background of the \"it's alright\" parts. Those were added at the very end. like during the final adjustments / mixing / troubleshooting phase. i opened the arrangement again to add those riffs there. and it made a huge difference some additional thoughts about the writing: it's important to point out that this song was essentially written in august 2011 (about 6 years before it was recorded). So this may slightly change the way the lyrics are perceived. Marijuana was not fully legal in any state at that time. and the reason it is about California is because that is the state that was most well known for marijuana usage at the time, because i think it had recently become legal medically. For every other state mentioned in the song, i'm pretty sure, it was still very illegal, especially in Alabama which i believe had some of the toughest marijuana laws at the time. One of the reasons i featured it in the second verse. Also, the final line of the song (love who you want to) was certainly a reference to the legalization of gay marriage, which at the time was only legal in certain places, which is another thing California was known for at the time"

        "question": "HELP! I have a song with a strong sixteenth note rhythm in 4/4 at 130BPM. But halfway through, the sixteenth notes stay the same tempo and switch to a triplet rhythm (alternating 1+ 2+ 3+ 4+ and 1 a2 a3 a4 a). How should I write that? Constant triplet brackets in 4/4? 12/16 time signature? A very uncomfortable 6/8?",
        "answer": "your description of the change is not entirely clear, but if it's all groups of 3, i would say use 12/8. and if the value of time needs to change, use 'note equals note' notation. for example if you're using 12/8 and you need the new tempo to be dotted quarter = 130, then write quarter note = dotted quarter note, when the transition occurs. However, (and this was unclear to me from your description) if the old 16th note needs to become the new 8th note (in 12/8) then you can write sixteenth note equals eighth note. Or if you use 12/16 you don't need any conversion. it will also be assumed that it's grouped in 3s if you beam them that way"

        "question": "I'm looking into different temperaments such as 19-TET. I've been listening to a few pieces in different temperaments but 19-TET seems to resonate particularly well for me for some reason, even though I don't fully get it. I've been trying to figure out how to use it myself but without a custom built 19-TET keyboard, it would be very difficult. Maybe I can manually write notes in a MIDI roll, but I want to be able to improvise. Even with one though, how do scales work? It seems to be still 8 notes, which I suppose maybe makes sense but then again does it and what do you do with all the other notes?!? Why do we use 8? Why do we use 12? I was looking into this and then I found Just Intonation (JI) again - yes I suppose it makes sense why we use 12-TET but why can't we use JI with modern tech? Can't we just change the fundamental when we modulate? Or, is it deeper than that? With JI (in C) does it mean that if I play an Fm7, it wil l still sound wrong as a C#7 would? I can't figure out how to properly play with a Just keyboard without spending $1400 on digital piano that does it for me. I think if our mortal minds could fully grasp this, then we would be able to create even more wonderful music. I think it's transcendental and we will never fully understand. Do you think? Or have I just not studied hard enough? Ahh I've been looking at this for days and I feel like it's at the very fundamental of music in general. My conclusion is quickly becoming \"it just does not really make very much sense\".",

        "question": "What does the bottom part of a time signature even mean? I've watched so many videos on it and I still can't grasp its purpose",
        "answer": "that is supposed to be what note a beat is. so if the bottom number is 4, the 'quarter' note is supposed to be the beat. if the bottom note is 8, then the 8th note is supposed to be a beat. so \"4/4\" is supposed to mean there is 4 beats per bar, and a quarter note is 1 beat. \"6/2\" would mean there is 6 beats in a bar and the half note is one beat. There are some problems with this system-- one problem is that in some countries the notes are not named like this (quarter, eigth, etc). And the other problem is that when the top number is a multiple of 3 and the bottom note is 8, it's usually not actually the 8th note that gets one beat, it's usually actually 3 eighth notes that get one beat. but at least the bar length will adhere correctly to the number system, so for example what i'm trying to say is, 6/8 in the real world usually does not actually mean 6 beats per bar with the 8th note getting one beat. instead it usually actually means there's 2 beats per bar and the dotted quarter note gets one beat. this is mathematically equivalent, but felt differently, for speed. but let's face it, who really wants to write 2/2.667"

And why do i need to move mountains in order to make a song? well i suppose that would be due to some brainular problem i have. so i have a religious daily mantra where i remind myself to make sure i move very very small mountains instead of big ones, but then when the experts arrive they usually determine that those mountains which i thought were small are in fact very large. which leads me to my next point which is that i apparently have difficulty judging size correctly, which is perhaps due to some brainular problem i have"

        "answer": "not good, so if i am doing it that must mean that the song has to feel extra good to counter balance the non-good ramifications of the extra length between 2:00 and 3:30 the one i am working on now was always known to be the longest, it's been listed as 4:52 for years, but i always assumed it would get a rewrite, and presumably get shorter. which is true, although i really couldn't get it below 4:10 i'm not sure. i've decided that counting them is not the best use of my time at this particular moment"

        "answer": "that's not true. the bob marley song was longer, and another one from 2011 was also longer the selection process was marred with highly potent self-doubting agony, which is to be expected. i did the standard procedure of combing the entire list and selecting ones that seemed like the right choice. then i did a few rounds of writing on those finalists, to boost their status even further. i was expecting to have to randomize amongst those, but i ended up setting a deadline/timelimit on when i had to choose, and just chose. i knew it was the right choice, and yet, the following morning, i reached such high levels of doubt that i actually convinced myself that i CANNOT do that one, and then quickly reminded myself that if i don't stick with that selection then the entire validity of the selection system is broken, and i also had to remind myself that any selection is going to give me various flashes of misery, until i delve into the writing process. i was able to recall that this exact same thing happened with the 'la de da' selection, where i doubted it so badly the next day that i actually changed my mind and then hated that option too and so i had to switch back. basically it all gets better once you start writing on it and start to find solutions for its problems"

        "question": "Do you plan the visuals in your videos while you're writing your music? Do the visuals influence the songwriting process? Or are the visuals planned/done after the song is essentially written?",
        "answer": "sometimes well, think of it this way, .... there would be no visuals planned BETWEEN the time of song writing and the time of song recording. after the song recording, that is when the visuals happen. but some things were probably obvious during the songwriting process. (i.e. 'lemon song' probably should have a lemon in the video). But here's a new twist that i've found: if you try to come up with visuals at the same time as writing the song, it actually helps you write the song. Even if that visual is not even used.... even if you dont even come up with any specific visual ...... just telling yourself to activate the part of your brain that thinks of visuals, for some reason it makes the songwriting 10x more potent. even if no visual is thought of, it tricks your brain into going to the right place. just to pretend you are supposed to be coming up with the visual. so in other words, when you're writing a song, pretend you're writing a video. it doesn't even matter if you even make a video, just tell your brain you're writing a video, and often you won't even come up with any visual but it still jumpstarts the songwriting when you think that way. hopefully i've explained it. i started doing that with 'best friends with my own front door', and i've been using that trick ever since. it's like opening the door to the next room, to help give you perspective on the room you are in"

Advantage of notation, is that you can read while you are playing, where as you can't really play something from a recording in real-time. Advantages to recording, you can record the music much more accurately, and express things that would be impossible to fully explain in notation"

Is there any way to explain this? If so, is there a way to stop this and actually make a song? And how do musicians make a good tune and good lyrics? Thabk you if you answered this Mr. Wurtz.",
        "answer": "gotta write it down immediately it's brand new, so you won't remember it properly until you've heard it a few times, but if you don't write it down (i.e. document it in some way, maybe on recording, it doesn't matter) then it will keep morphing, and if you spend any time away from it you will easily forget how it originally went there are different ways, my way probably takes about 10 years to get the hang of it, so you'll probably want one of the easier ways which i don't know about i think they all do it different ways"

        "question": "hi bill, your keyboard playing is very inspiring; do you have any tips on how to practice hand independence? it feels quite overwhelming as a process, i'm not exactly sure on how to babystep my way into that. thabks",
        "answer": "this is actually a relationship for more than 2. your right hand, your left hand, your voice, another person as the bass player, another singer, another person as a guitar/keyboard player, ...... Check around your ensemble (maybe just you) and tally up HOW MANY of those items are in your ensemble. (i listed 6 things, now that i count them). And now, keep in mind that there are maybe only THREE ROLES that those must play, IN TOTAL. not each. Basically it's 3 jobs to do. so think about how many people/things are doing them. If the amount of things/people doing the jobs is more or less than 3, then there will have to be some interesting agreements made. everyone probably can't/shouldn't do all 3 at the same time, unless they are very very coordinated with each other. And yet, on the other hand, if there's only 2 things/people, they will have to juggle the 3 roles. the 3 roles are bass, melody, chords. So let me give you some examples, and my point is that your hands have different jobs depending on the personell situation. so for example: let's say it's just you. and let's say you are using both hands and your voice. that's pretty clear, your left hand takes the bass, your right hand takes the chords mostly, and your voice takes the melody. Well, imagine, instead, that you already have a bass player in the band, and let's say you are NOT singing. In that case, the bass player plays the bass, and YOU will be playing NOT the bass, but the melody and chords -- probably 1 with each hand. This is an entirely different configuration because now you are playing chords with your left hand. Let's imagine a different situation-- let's say you are playing with no bass player, you are not singing, but you have another person who is the singer. In this case, you will be doing bass in left hand and chords on right. Let's look at another example: if it's you on keyboard, and someone else on guitar, and the guitar player is singing. Well, the 2 of you need to come to an agreement and one of you should take care of the bass, and the other should take care of the chords. An important hint is that there should not be more than 1 person taking care of the bass (unless it is written EXACTLY, AND if it's neccesary to be full of BEEF at that particular moment.-- this will only be good for a non-musical sound effect / rumble sound. will not really work musically/tonally.) Also the other combination i forgot to mention is, if you are playing piano by yourself with no other players and not using your voice-- in that case, you will be dividing the 3 roles amongst only TWO players (your 2 hands) so in that case, you sort of have to magically somehow juggle the 3 of them. So, between different combinations of bass, chords, melody, ... and the players: your left hand, your right hand, and your voice, there are many different combinations for what jobs your hands are going to play. So it's important to take a moment to notice which of these scenarios you are in. And beyond that, the strategy is essentially the same, which is to use your imagination and try to play songs in any possible way you can, because someone's gotta do it"

        "question": "what would you call a e-g-a-d voicing with bass on e? e-7 add 11 no 5? because sus4 would imply no 3rd, as opposed to no5 wouldnt it?",
        "answer": "that would pretty much be the only way to accurately convey the information to a stranger, using only a chord symbol. unfortunately it is probably too long to sight read. i suppose you could write A7sus4/E, but that may or may not send a different kind of message to the reader. My personal short hand for the chord you are talking about is E-sus11 (Emin sus11) however this is NOT something that you can use on a public chart and expect anyone to know what you are talking about, because it does not conform to any kind of standards that anyone knows. sus11 is something i made up, and you can't count on anyone guessing what you mean if you write that. i just use it because i use that all the time (actually with no E in the harmony, just in the bass), and another way of writing that is also Gsus2/E or maybe you could get away with G2/E (in case G2 is accepted as Gsus2 which it may or may not be). also it seems important to prioritize E in the chord symbol to make it plainly clear that this is acting like some kind of E minor chord, because anything else will make the reader have to pause and do some calculations. but as i said earlier, the only way to really do this is exactly the way you said it (add this, minus that, etc) and the reader will definitely have to do some calculations there as well yes"

        "answer": "what happened was, in the late 1900s, as the year 2000 approached, people started realizing that most of the computer systems in the world were actually only using 2 digits for the date. so \"75\" is assumed to mean 1975. this wasn't a problem when those systems were designed, because probably no one expected them to be still in use by the end of the century. but they were. So the fear was that some terribly unexpected stuff may happen around the world as a result of all the computer systems suddenly thinking it's 1900, instead of 2000. there was a widespread fear that everything would break down. but luckily, through hard work i think, most of the important systems managed to get fixed in time, so there really wasn't any huge catastrophe. This issue was known as the \"Y2K\" issue, but besides that, Y2K was actually just a nickname for the year 2000. so essentially, Y2K means the year 2000. hope that helps"

So anyway, he's working on doing this bush with a huge white glob of paint, and it falls on the floor a second time, and finally he decides to just, do it the normal way i guess (not with a huge glob), and so that works fine, then he leans down and cleans up those other 2 globs from before and says, embarrassed, 'that was just like Thursday to Paint.' 'That was some Thursday to Paint Shiat.'"

        "answer": "just start playing 2 strokes each hand, evenly, at some reasonable pace like 2 per beat, at 120bpm, and just speed up the tempo gradually. your hands will eventually figure out what you need to do. like that time when you learned to walk. actually wait i just remembered, here's a slightly more interesting tip .... try playing it so that the second note is actually the downbeat instead of the first note. so do like a RLLR-RLLR etc pattern, so the second stroke is the one that falls on the downbeat. and then gradually speed up from there. this way is actually very healthy to learn because it probably helps even out the strokes, by psychologically reversing the way your mind thinks of them. i just remembered that probably 80% of the doublestrokes i play are aligned this way, it's just more comfortable for me. it frees the pairs from prison of their pairing, if that makes sense. allows for stronger integration with singles actually, with more possibilities for sure. in other words it will help them not sound like doubles"

Sometimes in songwriting it's important to remember to space things out a bit, and it's easy to forget that writing a song is much slower than listening to a song, so sometimes it's good to remind yourself to let an additional moment go by for the previous lyric to be absorbed"

        "question": "how do you deal with blender's overwriting behaviour? i've been trying to use the ol \"try to just make sure you check before you hit render\" policy but it is still amazing how easy it is to hit the wrong directory and overwrite a whole scene :o (i only lost part of a draft render but this is still cause for concern)",
        "answer": "right, that's not a realistic workflow that was one of the main reasons i turned away from blender, years ago. But, now i've returned to it in a different light, and i embrace it because of it's vastly powerful scriptability. So what i do is this: the default render folder is the temp folder. those files will disappear soon anyway. As part of the render process, i have an automated process that happens as soon as the render is done, which copies the rendered movie automatically to my preferred folder, and automatically names it according to the time, for example: render20201019203817.mp4"

But here's something i should mention ..... it's hard to tell from your description, whether or not you have consulted the original recordings. from the recordings i've heard, which seem likely to be from the composer, the C7 you mentioned (which would actually be F7, in their key) ... actually already has a bit more to it than F7. so it's hard to tell whether you have taken that into account"

        "question": "why is it so much easier to start a new song than to continue one?? it's driving me crazy. you'd think continuing something would be easier than coming up with something from scratch, but no. i'm guessing you're going to answer with \"try making shorter songs\", but that doesn't solve the problem because it doesn't train the skill of coming up with \"the next part\" of a song. i think learning to play already existing songs on an instrument could help train that intuition, what do you think about that?",
        "answer": "here's what happened to me. when i was at your stage, one solution is to just finish it in 1 session. i was writing entirely on paper at that time. but i soon got tired of that method (it's a good method, but it results in some pretty mentally insane songs, with all due respect to mental insanity), and i also came up with a lot of choruses, verse fragments, or just intros, and didn't know how or WHEN to deal with them. but here's what i eventually did: i went through all my notes and collected every song or song fragment i had ever written or worked on. and i put them all into a list in chronological order. Then, i just started at the beginning of the list, and 'find the next thing' or, just 'answer the next question' on each of them, before moving onto the next one. this unfortunately would take infinite years, so i shuffled things up a little and did a percentage completion system, etc etc, but still had ways of selecting which one i was doing next. nowadays i'm selecting to record, which means whichever one i select, could be a fragment, is the one i will record. so that puts me in a situation of writing for the recording which is about to happen. I guess what i'm trying to say is, the selection process is so important because if you are not confident about the validity of your selection, then you will run away from the song. So i guess the selection is one half of the challenge. then there's just techniques to do once you're there and you're already sure you're working on the right song, now what do you do? Well it's a lot like being a doctor. you just have to ask good questions. First thing i would check, is, 'is this the beginning', like, does the piece you have belong at the beginning of the song, or in the middle, is it the chorus, etc etc. If it clearly belongs absolutely at the total beginning, then, the process is pretty simple. Just run it through, and stop playing at the end of what you have, and wait for lightning to strike. Then if it doesn't, ask as many questions as you can about what you think you might have been about to hear.... Then what i do, for a re-set, is i walk over and touch the door handle, and come back and run it again from the top, and do the same thing again. It's extremely important that you run it AT TEMPO (at the right tempo) because often what we do in songwriting if we're trying to think of ideas, we run the bit before, over and over and we start doing it faster, which will trick you into then writing things at the wrong tempo and it won't fit with the rest. so make sure all your run throughs are at tempo. it's good to get on the metronome as soon as you can, to preserve, because songwriting is a time warp and it can make things change speed when you didn't mean to. But i didn't mention what to do if the piece you have is NOT the beginning. in this case you are going to have to do a weird backwards puzzle to figure out what comes before. It's almost impossible to figure out what comes before something, actually. one weird trick which might be semi-reliable is to run the chorus and see if you can get a second verse, and then hope that one of the things around there also makes sense as an intro, but at least for me writing backwards is almost impossible"

        "answer": "here's what i've discovered: i choose all the instruments i want first. then i go through the song and figure out where each one goes. instead of going to a place, and finding the instrument, i first get the instrument, and then find where it fits. i call this the sprinkle technique. This actually won't take care of the entire song, because if you only do sprinkles, you will usually never end up getting the important mainstays like the kick and bass, etc, but, it is a good technique nonetheless. it is particularly exciting when you do sprinkles first, before doing anything else. by the way this only works if you've written the song first before you start recording it, and have the exact road map"

        "answer": "no, but, keep in mind you will need to be well open to playing notes that may be very different from what occured on the recording. in other words, of course you can do it, but you can't be afraid to approach it entirely differently it involves mostly the same creativity that is involved in songwriting. somehow you have to make something up maybe all it takes is to be trapped on an island with only the piano and your voice. it's amazing how quick you can come up with good solutions, when you have fewer tools. basically i can promise you 2 things: 1, it can be done, but 2, you may have to re-invent the whole thing, which is really why it's gonna be so much fun"

        "question": "In a question from yesterday asking about memorizing major and minor scales, you answered that it would ruin the music and prevent genuine playing. This worries me because the way I try to orient myself on the piano and guitar is by completely relying on memorization of the major scale. For the key of the song and/or the chord of the current measure, I visualize the shape given by the major scale that corresponds with that chord as numbers from 1-7 (along with 9,11,13 I guess, and also stuff like #5, b3, etc.), and so those numbers go on different keys/frets depending on the key/current chord. I wouldn't really be sure how I'd find my way around without this orientation. Is this a bad way to be going about it, and if so, is there another method you would suggest that doesn't rely on the major scale?",
        "answer": "it would be bad for me, but, one of the wilder things i've learned in life is that different people are so different basically you could just start with one note. just play that note, now you know how it feels to play that note. so you have 2 options: playing the note, or playing nothing. think of the wonderous portraits you could paint, just from painting and not painting that note. Gradually, when you're ready, add another note to the notes you know. just learn what the notes sound like, 1 note at a time, and let them gradually assimilate themselves into your repetoire. the darn thing happens pretty much automatically the more time you spend around the instrument"

        "answer": "i never said that i don't agree with that entirely that is a much more attractive idea to endorse objectivity and subjectivity are tools to determine which person is right and which person is wrong. the person who knows the words 'objectivity' and 'subjectivity' is always right, and here's how they do it: first they say 'subjectively', which means people are allowed to disagree. Then, they provide an alternate situation, 'objectively', which means there is only one right answer and you are not allowed to disagree with that. It's sort of like a good cop / bad cop scenario, where the 'subjectivity' scenario gives you a false sense of comfort, thinking it's ok for people to have different opinions, then the hammer comes down when 'objectively' there is only one true opinion, which spells checkmate for the other person of course"

        "question": "how does daylight saving time actually work?",
        "answer": "during the spring and summer months, the clock tells you a later time than it actually is. so it makes the evening seem a little lighter and the morning a little darker. this is besides the fact that the evening and morning are both already lighter than they were in the winter, but because of daylight saving, the evening is WAY more lighter, and the morning is ..... only a little bit lighter. it shifts the daylight later by 1 hour. in the springtime, when it changes, you will always hear people saying 'wow i can't believe it's still light at this time of evening', and in the fall when it switches back, you will hear people saying, 'wow i can't believe it's already dark at this time of evening.' However, what you may not hear, but is still said, is similar but reversed comments about the morning. But with a different twist, because it goes in the opposite direction of the way it's been heading. so, for example, in the springtime in the morning, after it changes, people in the early morning will be saying 'well, the mornings have been gradually getting lighter these past few weeks, but they just suddenly got darker again, although i know they are still going to gradually get ligher from here.' and in the fall, in the morning, just after it changes back, people in the early morning will say 'well, the mornings have been getting gradually darker over the past few weeks, but suddenly they just got brighter again, although i know they still will continue to get darker from here.'"

        "question": "im teaching my nephews piano and i wanted to get your thoughts and ideas on how im approaching it. for the younger ones i am first making sure they know where do is. then the rest of the white notes. teaching them how to sing a major scale. then i invite them to make a song up by plaiyng with the black keys, so they can have pentatonic fun. For the older one, he came to class knowing jingle bells. he likes learning songs. i am thinking of teaching him some chords to play along with jingle bells. but i also am teaching him a bit about the circle of fifths, how it relates to sharps and flats in different keys, and then showing him how jingle bells can be played starting in any note. I am very slowly trying to teach them how to read notes off a pentagram but I feel like that can dampen the excitement for the instrument if it becoems too \"academized\". I took a look at a teaching book and it doesnt look too fun tbh. maybe the best time to teach them to r ead musi c is when they want to learn a specific song? I can notate it for them and have them read off it? They range ages 4 to 10 probably. Some are more motivated than others but i feel they can all get excited about different aspects of piano/music/learning",

        "answer": "my first plan was march 26, 2019. then i made some bold new discoveries and worked on it for a long long time, not having any clue of when it would be done. then i made some even bolder discoveries which totally sidelined that video, then after a long long time of further experiments and development, somewhere around august 2020 i threw a dozen panic attacks simultaneously and made another plan for oct 6, 2020. but this was innacurate of course, again because of the fact that the whole process and procedure is essentially brand new. so basically i've been working steadily on the video ever since then, at a somewhat defeated and disheartened pace. so if i were to make up a due date, it would hold no validity at this point due to so many past failures. however, i am still working on the same item since late august 2020, and it is an ordinary song/video of average size. things are going quite well, and some brand new doors have been opened and will continue to open over the next 5 to 10 years, in terms of the content that will be made. however, the other side of the coin is that i am face to face with the imminent threat of complete ineptitude, simply due to my ongoing tendency to overestimate what i am capable of. this has plagued me for my entire life, and probably will require a more definitive solution than i've had before, if i intend to continue producing creatively for the rest of my life. which i do of course, even if just to catch up with the things i've already written. and that's not even including the fact that my propensity for writing has only amplified even more with each passing year, as it always has every week if all goes well"

Obviously there are people who do this/have done this, but it is a small minority still and thus not normal. it seems like you know you're not normal and that's why you feel the need to keep insisting that you are. i'm not saying it's bad not to be normal, i think it's good, if you were normal then i wouldn't even know who you were or be sending you this message.

Trying to figure out how good any of the songs actually turned out to be, is impossible and pointless, for me. i tried to make each one to be the best song that ever existed. none of them actually turned out that way, but that's just the nature of the job, which continues on into the future in the same fashion"

        "question": "i've spent basically every bit of time i can in the past few years working on my music, instruments, and mixing as well as getting completely obsessed with video as well. realizing that i will be like this for the foreseeable future (and it keeps getting more obsessive and intense) i feel like i am getting more and more disconnected from reality (whatever that means). while i \"know\" many people from working on songs and production for other artists, i feel more and more disconnected and unsure of what a friend is and what music even is. this obsession only happened in these past few years, before i had played instruments just because it felt like an obvious thing to do, but without any real intention of making something. people i \"used to know\" have been very worried about my mental health due to the drastic change over time and how little time i have for anything other than working constantly on art. i find all this extremely hard to explain proper ly to so meone, and i haven't found anyone that seems like they actually understand what i'm trying to do (i don't know if i do sometimes). the thing im worried about is how i can get myself to take breaks effectively and somehow divert my obsessive attention into something \"fun\" that is unrelated sometimes. nothing is fun unless im working on a project; everything other than that just feels like a crazy waste of time as well. anyway, do you have any suggestions about learning how to effectively take breaks? i've tried various meditation techniques with little success. the only thing that really seems to work decently is going on a reeaaally long walk, and then i sometimes notice that i haven't had a conscious thought in minutes, and it is both a scary and good feeling at the same time.",

        "question": "As a musician who likes to listen to songs and try to imitate them to a T, your music is the only kind so far I haven't been able to figure out all the notes to. There's just so much unique, complex genius that goes into them. Listening to the first few seconds of \"And the Day Goes On,\" for instance, the snare drum doesn't follow a rhythmic pattern (although it works beautifully), so I have to listen to it 2 seconds at a time to understand it (while isolating it in my mind from the other instruments, which is hard to do when I get mesmerized by the chords). There's also some subtle tambourine and a few short flute notes in there, that you have to listen closely to hear, and then a bunch of different instruments starting to pour in. It's incredible. I'm in awe. Where do you get that otherworldly \"feel\" for music from? The heavens? Apollo is not the God of music; Bill Wurtz is.",
        "answer": "holy ocean replenishment ceremony, you are very friendly it happens automatically over time. it sounds like you already have plenty of belief in what's possible, so you're going to end up learning to do it better and better, over time i think you will soon find out that it's actually you"

        "question": "are you proud of the music and videos you make? i think you should be but i also know that im never proud of my work",
        "answer": "it depends what mood i'm in just keep doing it, eventually you will be, with also feelings of unproud mixed in. this is to drive you to do better. but, it might help if you can find some stories about other artists, artists whom you think are great, and discover all the times they've felt frustrated with their own work. there is no limit to what we can imagine, but there always seem to be limits on what we can physically do. so that can be enormously frustrating. but what makes it work is the imagination of the viewer, which you can play to. this can be easy to forget, because the viewer will never notice it when it works, they'll just think the artist actually did everything. but they didn't, and they were probably very concerned about this at the time"

        "question": "how did the sign in im best friends with my own front door get bad bad",
        "answer": "i'll tell you exactly how it happened. i was on a brand new break-neck schedule, where i was supposed to finish a song/video every 2 weeks, which was so much tighter than i had ever previously done it (at least 4x quicker), that no one believed was possible. so this is supposedly the first song of this new scheme, which essentially seems more like a dare at this point, because it's so absurd. So i had spent an entire day songwriting and i pretty much only made it through 2 stanzas. so the next day i had to kick myself and realize that this schedule is so ridiculous that i need to finish the song in the next 4 hours or it's pretty much game over. the 'sign' bit is the first bit to be written under that assumption. so in a way you can probably assume that this is the feeling of realizing i am going to have to steamroll the entire remainder of the songwriting process for this song. And i should clarify, steamrolling sometimes leads to fantastic growth, and i am thrilled with where the song ends up going, especially toward the end. and i don't think it would have ever gone like that, had the prior steamrolling not occured. it's a lesson that continues to play out again and again in the creative process, in the context of a world with limited time and resources"

Sometimes you can skip the first idea and just start writing, and then get ideas along the way. still must finish the entire writing before the recording starts. that's just how i do it however good you want to be sometimes in a live band, both hands on the keyboard is too many. depending on who else is in the band no"

So in this way, it's impossible to determine if any 1 item is nice, or if any 2 items together are nice. i can promise you, for as many situations as you might find where 2 items seems nicer than one, there is also a similar sister-scenario out there where 1 thing seems nicer than 2.

        "question": "what's a song writing process look like for you? do you have something set you do every time or is it just organic?",
        "answer": "at any time, anywhere, ideas can fall on me. even in dreams. that is one part of the process. learning to catch these is crucial to this part of the process. about 70% of the strongest ideas come unexpectedly, not during a songwriting session. So they must be captured and cataloged properly. At that time usually no work is done beyond the capture of the idea. Alternatively, to generate ideas, a more deliberate idea generation session can occur. this is planned, when you try to come up with ideas. remembering a key principle which is that songs can come from literally anywhere, there may be various clever strategies about which places to look. the fun part is, because they can come from anywhere, there is no limit to the places you can look. But still, this is just idea generation, separate from the remainder of the songwriting work. it's still just an idea generation session. Then there is the 'work', which is when you tend to entries in the catalog. depending on the situation, you may be tasked to finish an entire item, or just part of it, before moving onto another. But in either case, you are essentially playing hospital with the song. diagnose it, figure out what it is, what it wants to be, what it's meant to be, etc, and make decisions accordingly. 95% of the time i work strictly forwards, only being concerned with what comes next, and continuing along in order, forwards. The only situation where i would be forced to work backwards is if the original idea does not belong at the beginning. then it's a puzzle to fill in what came before, which seems to defy all laws of physics for me. very unusual. but it can be done and there are various tricks which work with varying degrees of effectiveness. So the majority of the songwriting process (basically all of it except the initial idea seed) follows the same idea of figuring out what comes next. so there are a few important practices that always seem to hold true. agree on an exact tempo as soon as you can, and run a metronome to keep from drifting. this avoids a crisis where you've drifted the tempo and now you may be writing at a level of density which is never gonna fit at the same tempo as what you've already written elsewhere in the song. another important concept is the fact that you really only know what's best the FIRST time you hear it. so you have to do whatever you can to protect this authentic, real time run through, from the mindset of never having heard it before. of course, when you're working, you're inevitably gonna hear it many times. a standard trick i use to help 're-set' is to walk to the door and touch the door handle (with the metronome running) and return and run-through from the beginning. it's also important to remember, full run-throughs are much much more valuable than only running the last part. the full-run through is the only thing that's going to truly reveal where we are at, at a certain point in the song, and thus to properly determine what happens (or does not happen) next. Another thing to realize, if nothing seems to be working and you keep trying things and ditching them, it's important to recognize that the ideas get worse the more you reject them. so if you reject 3 ideas, the 4th will be worse. so if you get too deep into a hole of rejecting, it can be useful to recognize that the first one might be the best one you're gonna get, and make extra effort to try to make the first one work, because in that case it's usually your best shot. Finally, another interesting trick which i've been using a lot recently is, pretend it's in a video. pretend it's taking place in a movie, inside a story. This doesn't even mean you're gonna write a video, but sometimes just pretending it's taking place in a video, will immediately cause interesting songwriting to materialize effortlessly. it's bizarre, because many times when this technique is working, it's not even associated with any particular video content. it's just because you told yourself to pretend you are thinking of visual content, this somehow creates an automatic trigger for songwriting"

        "question": "Recently you've said that you only know what works best the FIRST time you hear it, but what happens when you know what you are going to need before you start? Is there a naive mode of thinking to trick your brain into finding flangers and phasers as interesting as when you first used them? Or is that something which you need before their practice and use can be picked up easily?",
        "answer": "you might have taken that out of context, but that sounds like something i've said about SONGWRITING i wasn't talking about the recording/production process. only the songwriting process, which, for me, happens entirely before the production of the song starts. so generally, no flangers or phasers are used"

        "question": "In \"La de da de da de da de day oh\" you rhymed \"mall\" 3 times, was there any hidden meaning behind that?",
        "answer": "yes, this is what it is: After selecting this song for recording, i felt deep dread and regret the next day. basically there is a lot of anxiety around selecting a song to record and do a music video for, because unfortunately, for some unknown reason, i always make my songrecordings and videos very complicated. so it is a large commitment when choosing a song. At the time of selection, the song was only written up to the end of the first chorus. So i was feeling a deep amount of regret, the day after selecting it. but changing it would increase all doubts all around, because it had been a very thorough selection process, and if i invalidated that it would cast even larger shadows of doubt on the entire ability to select a song. So i was sitting in the waiting chairs for a haircut, just being very unsure of how to carry forward with the song, ... i had already attempted to change my mind earlier in the morning, to a much slower and sadder song. and i found myself circling back again to 'la de da', and just at the exact moment i was getting into the haircut chair, i let my mind turn to what i think might happen next, in the writing. obviously we are going into the second verse. And it's moments like these, when we say 'what if', that suddenly a blitz of writing comes. The first 3 lines of the second verse came at me very quickly. the relentlessness of the word 'mall' had a nice momentum to it, and certainly helped to plunge me into confidence that the song was the right choice, and by the time i got into the chair, i was certain i would be doing that song. the 4th line, however, did not come at all, and i had to force it later in the actual writing session and i am to this day not proud of it. so if i could summerize the answer to your original question, the meaning of the triple mall is 'momentum'"

        "question": "if you wouldn't mind temporarily stepping out of the mindset of producing your newest and soon-too-be-hopefully-greatest song and video, is there any song you've made in the past that stands out to you in any way; and if so, would you have any thoughts you could share?",
        "answer": "yes on 'hallelujah', i decided to START the entire recording process on an EQ setting that mimics the speaker on a smartphone. the reason i did this was to try to have a better guarantee that the arrangement would make sense there (literally no bass). it sometimes stresses me out that that platform is so drastically different from the ones that include the bass (headphones, car speakers, etc). It's almost like if you are doing a TV show and 40% of your audience can't see the color green. If you are making the project on a system where you CAN see the color green, you're gonna have no idea what those greenless viewers are even seeing. Some people check different systems at the very end, and then make 'adjustments', but i figured it's way too late if you check it at the end. so i decided to start the entire process in the bassless mode, to make sure i was making decisions that were strong on that platform. Then turn the bass frequencies back on and then fill in the bass i want for the full-range listeners. This seemed like a good idea but it didn't really go so well and i don't do it anymore. it didn't really harm the sound of the song, but it encouraged me to overthink even more than i normally do"

        "question": "ik this is a tired type of question, but whats the inspiration/meaning behind your video Time Mop? it's very different than other things you were making at the time and gives off some weird vibes.",
        "answer": "there are 2 elements to that, which came about completely separately. the audio, and the video that goes with it. The audio recording, called \"time mop\", was part of a series of 4 recordings i made in june 2009. my career felt way way too speculative for many years up until then, and i was getting very desperate to actually make some recordings. so in a fit of rage and desperation, i did \"help, i'm trapped in the center of a rectangle\", and 3 others, including \"time mop\". those are just instrumental music pieces, with no video. Then, later, around 2014, after i had finally begun actually making videos, sometimes song-videos, one of the types of videos i was doing would be music videos to go with songs i had already recorded. i had done some of these already, and they all were songs with lyrics. When there's lyrics, it usually gives you a pretty obvious guide for what might happen in the video. But, what if it's an entirely instrumental song? what would the video look like then? So i decided to try. Actually, i just remembered, i had actually begun to do work on this video as early as 2013, in the early stages of experimenting with video. and then i picked it up again after the regular video production schedule was underway. So it was originally an instrumental, in 2009, as a challenge to myself to do ANYTHING (besides textual non-video non-music), and the video in 2013 was a challenge to see if i could do a music video for a song without lyrics"
