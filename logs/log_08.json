        "answer": "ok. it's even, so in half is 25117 (easily seen as 50 2 34 going to 25 1 17). checking for 3, so knock 117, and 25 not, so no 3. checking 7, knock the 7, =2511, knock left from 21, =111, which is known (37x3) so no. checking 11 (in 25117) knock left from 22, = 311, knock 11, =3 (not 11). checking 13 (in 25117), up to 25130, =2513, knock the 13 left with 25=no. checking 17 (in 25117), knock from right, =251, knock 51 (knowkn 17x3), left with 2=no. checking 19 (in 25117), knock back from left = 6117, knock left back again to 57, = 4117, knock back left again to 38, = 317, known prime, but in case you're not sure, knock the left back again so it's 12 7 (127) even more well known prime, or if you don't believe me and feel like subtracting 57 (known 19x3) and knock the zero you must be at a single digit number (no 19) that's without even requiring you to bother subtracting 57 from 127. checking 23 (in 25117), from the right, up to 2514(0), 2514, knock down the left, 214, in half is 107 nope (known prime, the first 100s decade is a known 'full house'). checking 29 (in 25117). known trick: 203. add 203 is 2532(0), in half, is 1250 plus 16, 1266. in half is 633, by 3 is 211. add 29 won't reach 290, so no. checking 31 (in 25117) i'll add 93, = 2521(0). 2521 minus 31, seen as 252-3, = 249 already know that as 83x3 so no (or just add 31, to get 280, =28no.) checking 37 (in 25117), add 333 (the 111 trick x3) is 2544zap i mean 2545. double it, 50 9(0), =509, plus 111 is 620, 62(no) (in half 31no). checking 41 (25117), how about adding 123, = 2532, minus 82 is 245(0), doubled is 39 (3x13) so no. checking 43 (25117) added to right is 2516, in half is 1258, in half is 629, plus 301 (known trick for 43) is 930, no (31x3). checking 47 in 25117, so 2511 minus 4, is 2507, minus 47 means 250 minus 4, is 244, in half is 122, in half 61 so no. checking 53, 25117, = 2517(0), 2517, and 53 added to right again is 257, add to right again is a mildly tedioius 31(0). so no. checking 61 (in 25117). hm, how about 243. knock from left is 817. left can knock back to 20, =207. known 9, so def wrong range for 61. checking 67. 25117 minus 67 is 2505(0). doubled is 501. minus 201 (known trick for 67), =200 so no. checking 71, triple it to 213. 25117 plus 213, = 2513(0), and knock from right is an easy 2300 (=23) so no. checking 73, 25117, add to right is 2519. hm, triple the checker to 219, down to 2300 again, so no. checking 79 (in 25117), ouch, hm, 511 is a trick for 79, ... take that out of the middle? 20007, still not very useful for me unfortunately. must triple 79. that's 240-3 so 237. from 25117, ok, just 2511 minus 23. not fun for me. would be 2477 plus 11, how's that. ok, 2488, half to 1244, to 622, to 311, add 79 to right is 39no. checking 83 in 25117, evens out neatly to 252. half to 126. to 63, (known 7x9) = no. checking 89, i like 801 as a trick here, not the best but decent, triple it is 2403, put that on the right of 25117 is 2 75 20, = 2752. in half, forget it, try doubling the trick (801 to 1602), 2752 minus 1602, = 115. that's 23 so no. checking 97, easy, from right, (25117) is 2502. in half is 1 25 1 (1251), minus 291 (known triple of 97) would be... 10 6. 106, so 53 so no. checking 101, here's where it gets breezy, 25117 plus 303 is 2542(0), in half is 1 27 1 (1271), minus 101 is 117(0), (not 101). checking 103, 25117 add 103 is 2522(0), in half is 1 26 1 (1261), how about plus 309 (103x3). so that's 157(0). not 103 and too close. so no. checking 107. 25117 down to 2501. how about add 321 (triple) so like 250 plus 32. is 282. in half 141. known 47, also clearly no 107. checking 109, let's stop and figure out how high we have to go. 256 has square root of 16. so that means 160 squared is 25600. so if we reach 160 that's far enough. checking 109, or 327. 2511(7), 2511 minus 32, not fun, how about 2468 plus 11. 2479. minus 109 is 237(0), when compared with 327 is clearly wrong for 109. checking 113 (in 25117), add to right is 2523. go down, is 241. in that range it would have had to be 226, so no. checking..127 (that right there is what's known as the 'longest gap so far'), 25117 and down to , wait, 2511 minus 12, is 2499. by 3 is 833. plus 127 puts you evened out at less than 100(0) so no. checking not 129 (that's a 3), check 131. triple it, 393. use 393 on the right, 25117 go up to 2541. down 131 from right, is 241. down 131 goes to 11(0) and out. checking not 133 (that's 19) check 137. 25117, minus 137, means 2511 minus 13, so 2498, in half is 1299, by 3 is 433. is that 137? you would expect 411. (300 plus 111) so no. checking 139, ...... 75351 (just tripled the target number as an escape plan), add 139 to right is 7569, and down to 743. i've been really trying to avoid tripling 139 but i guess i have to, 140 tripled (i'm not good at this) 420, minus 3 is 417. (should have had my 117 more handy as a 39 triple there) 743 plus 417 is 115(0) and that's just 23. (no). checking 141 no that's 47, checking 143 not necessary, checking 147 no that's just 49, checking 149 of course. triple it is 447. 2511(0) minus 44(7).. erm.... 2511 minus 44 i hate my self, is 2464 plus 11 is 2475. double, is 48 no 495(0). double is 99(0) and no. checking 151 (149 and 151 are known twins), triple is 453, 25117 plus 453 means 2512 plus 45, 2557 right? plus 453 should end in 1(0), like 256 plus 45, ok 301. minus 151 definite no, after dropped zero you'd be 2 digits. checking 157, this is the last number to check because 159 would be a 3, and 160 squared is bigger than the target, and if everything so far was done correctly then the only available option left would be 157 squared, which should have to end in 9, which would be wrong, but just in case we'll check 157. 25117, down from right, which would mean 2511 minus 15, so 2496, in half goes to 1248, 624, 312, by 3 is 104 and no. so i am afraid here is where we finally meet the brick wall. so final answer 25117 x 2"

        "question": "CAn you prime factor 46692 in your head? Need it FOr my math homework?",
        "answer": "i'm stopping if i have to check past 127. that's my new rule. 46692, even, so halve it, 23346, and again, a little more difficult, my trick is digit by digit but for odd digits go one lower and then add 5s back, one digit to the right of where the odd digits were. so 11123, then put the 5s back as 11673. checking for 3, it's just adding up the digits, and you can knock them out as you see them. 1167 digits add up to 15, so yes, we have 3 in it. must divide 11673 by 3. knock off the 3, is 1167, add 3 is 117(0), 117 is 9 times 13 or 39 times 3. so retrace the steps, 39 times 3 is 117, need to go down to 1167 (from 1170) which means 390 minus 1, is 389, then the other way to add 3 (for 11673) means add 1 to 389 in the next digit, so 3891. so 3x3891 should be 11673, does that look right. yes. Check for 3 again, in 3891, it's there again, because knock the 9 and knock the 8 and 1, and 3 left. how about 3000 and 810 and 81. so 1000 plus 270 plus 27. 1270 plus 27. 1297. so 1297x3=3891, does that look right. yes it does. Ok so check for 7, knock it off the right leaves 129, known to be 43, so 7 is out. checking 11 (in 1297), knock it off the left, 197, already no because it would need to be 198, so no 11. checking 13, well 3 more is 1300 so no. checking 17 (in 1297), take it off the right, it's 128, that's a power of 2 so no way. checking 19, 1297 minus 57 is 124, in half is 62, then 31, so no. Being aware of the limits here, we only have to check up to the square root of the target number, so right now that means the square root of 1297. 30 squared is 900, and 40 squared is 1600, so certainly 37 is already too high to check, so this shouldn't take long even at worst. which it likely is, because the chances get less and less of finding a match as you move up. so next to check is 23, checking in 1297, add it, is 1320, 132, in half is 66, that's just 11, so no. 29, trick for that is 203, added to 1297 is 1500, so no. 31, tripled is 93, 1297 plus 93 is 139(0), plus 31 levels it off at less than 200 so that means a result less than 20, so not 31. 37 has virtually no chance of being it because i think its square is too high, and if we're correct so far, the only option left anyway would have to be a square, which would have to end in 9, but i'll check anyway in case i've made a mistake, 1297 minus 37 is 126(0), in half is 63 (known 9x7) so no. so retracing our steps the final answer would 2x2x3x3x1297"

        "answer": "i've done it multiple times, but there will certainly be a meal break the more you are able to work your way up to it, on previous days, the less soreness there will be. if your average daily walk is 1 minute and then you do 8 hours, you'll be fucked. try to increase more gradually over the course of different days i wear sneakers, but it's important to make sure they have established a comfortable relationship with your feet already. don't do this with brand new sneakers you've never worn before that would depend on my agenda for the day. sometimes there would have already been an engagement scheduled at that destination. i think that is the ideal situation for a mega-walk, is when you actually had to be at that destination at that time, and where a normal person would have taken some form of higher speed transportation. just walk there instead. also, when you get there, it's fun to watch people flip the hell out when they find out where you just walked from i think i prefer when there is a destination. that's just me"

        "question": "So I've recently been trying to be more conscious of the melodies that randomly pop into my head and have been making a point to document them and it has been very weird so far. I've realized that I actually don't give myself many chances to come up with stuff. This is because I'm either at work (aka: the no-melody zone) or I'm somewhere else listening to music. When do you find that these melodies appear? Also, I feel weird being conscious of them now. Almost like I'm prohibiting them from appearing by being aware of the possibility of that exact thing happening. Is this feeling to be expected? Should it be dealt with? Oo, and what do you do to rid your brain of the most recent song you've heard?",
        "answer": "hm, i would think a lot of them would appear there, in your mind all the time, but from what you said at the top, it seemed like you already had melodies coming to you yes i think what will actually help with this is just more experience and speed when documenting them. so it will seem trivial to document anything that appears. keep in mind, in the digital age, recordings are well allowed, as long as you can keep them sorted/logged plant another song. actually hear it, (works best), or just start imagining it. that's all it takes really"

'chorus' ... or anything) to melt a bit. this is normal"

        "question": "Things i want to do i dont do. is this deppression? I want to finsh this song i made but i dont want to bother with the tedious aspects of daws. I DONT want to be fat and keep eating chips all day but i got more motivation to walk down to 7/11 and get some than to record the synth guitar solo for my song. Heres a secret tho, Im terrified of actually finishing the song in case it doesnt come out as the masterpiece i imagine with this work in progress. Do i really want anything if i dont do anything?",
        "answer": "we'll see about that no one does yes. the trick is, there is a tangle in the logistics of the exact steps and methods of HOW, on a very simplistic level. there are some very important unknowns here that you are unable to find the answers for, because you have not clearly located the questions. but they are there. untangling these small issues will cause magnificent surges of fresh unique inspiration that are so distinctively you that you will not be able to resist the seemingly automatic forward motion that will occur as a result. it will be as easy and addictive as chips, but lightyears more powerful. i am narrowing it down to 2 issues here: 1 is the tangled confusion of issues you know somewhere deep within your mind need to be answered, but are buried too deep to remember the details, and the other issue is simply the fear that this song will be your only song. which, to be fair, it may seem that way based on your observation of the current pace. the important rule here is that every song gets better, but i realize this doesn't help if the pace does not seem commensurate with any realistic progress timeframe. So, you need to approach this tangle. It's important to recognize that recording and arranging your own songs is by nature a very tangly and complicated mess. for this reason, it is vitally important that you practice simplicity at all costs, in every aspect of the arrangement. always remember, there was once a time when people had to record on 4 track tape machines and the only way to get more tracks was to burn 3 tracks down to 1, never being able to change them again. in some ways i'm sure your computer software is crippling because it affords you too many options. so simplicity is necessary at all costs, and i think you can expect to have to remind yourself that again and again. But as far as untangling the confusion points, i will tell you one thing that is vitally important to me which i cannot live without, and i've done it for years and continue to do it to this day, in fact it saved my day today and rescued me from the sour depths similar to what you described, and continues to save my ass again and again for at least 10 years or more now, and it's this: keeping a very open freeflowing documentation/discussion of your entire thought process and everything relating to the project, and stay especially in touch with the origins of the project and continue to backtrack and re-explain to yourself how and why you started doing this project and everything that led to it and everything that has gone into it. keep a constant open dialogue with yourself, whether in writing, text, audio, video, or all of those at the same time. drench yourself in discussion of the issues. get it all out in the open. it's like a tangled rope. what you have been doing, it seems, as you described it in your question, is trying to pull on the ends of the rope. what i am describing is when you go into a large room, and lay the rope out on the floor and get a better look at how this thing got this way. and the crazy thing is, every time, when you start to solve it and those tangles come out, not only is it wildly refreshing to have a freely untangled rope, what's crazy is all these memories start flooding back to you about every little tangle as it comes out, and suddenly start to remember exactly how all of them got there in the first place. it's like the big bang all over again"

I'm not sure how to classify it so I can't search for information online. The particular voicing in Joplin's work just sounds so crisp and I'm not sure where that's coming from. Is it just the proximity to the g major triad in root position that gives it that effect and nothing else? I'm playing around with it in other keys and it's kind of rocking my socks. Have you used it before?",

Anyways, & I know it's not the time, but when you do press a 2-disk vinyl for what you determine how be your first album over your 40-ish track portfolio, you want master files wherein the lower-mids/bass/sub is all mixed center channel. It's a limitation of the format, otherwise the needle will skid off track or distort the music. This should be in a 24-bit 48k or higher, even if the original masters were 16-bit 42k. If the factory only accepts audio cd masters, run the fuck away. Seriously, even pre-orders would get you, personally, through the next year. Or, you can do cassette ie Can I Borrow A Feeling?",

        "question": "I want to buy a pen tablet for digital drawing, do you think the \"One by Wacom\" is as good as the Intuos?",
        "answer": "well, the problem i'm having with the intuos on mac os 10.14 is that it just doesn't stay connected. While i'm drawing it stays connected, but let's say i do some other things (not drawing), maybe have lunch, go to bed, etc etc etc. Then, when i go to draw again, ok it's time to draw i would like to draw now please, ... it just does not work. I am specifically talking about wired mode (forget bluetooth). The only reliable way to make the thing work is to log out and log in again, you have to do this each time you want to start drawing on a new day basically. i am pretty disappointed because it is supposed to be a high quality tablet which is pretty expensive. The only other wacom experience i had was with the 2012 wacom bamboo which i was using on mac os 10.6.8, for years and years, and worked perfectly, always, any time i needed it. Besides this, another side note which i have learned about a graphics tablet is i think i have concluded that a small tablet is actually better. unless it has an actual display on it in which case larger would be better but that's almost a different product entirely, and a very different price range, more comparable to an ipad or touch laptop"

        "question": "Why is there something rather than nothing? hotewig briefly covers this topic, as an unknown entity wishes to be something, go somewhere, do something, for things to change, and to invent time and space. But those concepts didn't even exist before the universe started. Those concepts only work within the framework of the universe and everything not existing all at once (separated by time). Somehow, it devised the concept of \"change\" in a sea of where the concept of change didn't even exist. In fact, nothing would have been able to devise the concept of change, as thinking requires change in the form of movement of electricity across neurons, and in the energy expended thereof. There was a point in the nothingness that was perturbed somehow, and this first change led to a cascade. What perturbed nothingness? Did nothingness not-exist forever which is so long that something would've happened? Is this the consequence of eternity?",
        "answer": "don't you get it, there's both. but you obviously don't notice the nothing because it's nothing. there could be nothing for almost infinite years and you wouldn't be around to even wonder about it until the moment that you are here the only possible explanation i could have is that the essence of consciousness supercedes all of physical somethingness. that would actually explain a lot, would explain why consciousness is so freakin weird i blame you yes, but you can't quite say 'did' because that's a time word yes"

        "answer": "there is something quite like that. i have it mapped to a regular space bar on another keyboard, but looking into it it seems like it's just F3. however, i can't guarantee that that's the default, i may have switched the key blender uses. To find out, go to preferences, go to 'keymap', and in the search bar type 'search' and you should see something called 'window search', and it should say what key it is, which for me is saying F3 but i can't remember if that's the default setting. Another thing you might find useful, for example, in the node editor windows, whenever you press 'shift A' to add something, that menu has a search thing in it, so in that case it would be 'shift A', 'S' to trigger that, if you happen to be in a node editor window which will allow you to search nodes to add. some of the other sections probably have search tricks hiding in them as well, but as i said the main one is called 'window search' and it's F3 on mine which may or may not be the default but you can find out in the preferences and set it to your own choice"

        "question": "A comment on \"Hi, I'm Steve\" said that the video was depicting the life of a depressed schizophrenic who the video shows gradually mentally destabilizing because he is not happy in life. The comment then goes on to state that the video is told through Steve's eyes and the \"random bursts into jingles\" show how \"childlike his mind is\". The mountains are categorized as his mental issues, which he can't climb, but due to the mail (medication) that the girl mailman (doctor/nurse) delivers to him helps to mask these issues to help it look like they are working. According to the comment, he then states that he can suddenly climb the mountains, proving that the medication is appearing to work. The rain at the end implies depression which is the result of the medication not helping Steve. The weather forecast at the very end depicts that he will have this depression forever, and the final line, \"Bye, I'm Steve\" shows that he is not happy with life and kills himself. I'd like to know your thoughts on this theory. All credits for the comment go to shredup chopel.",

And I don't mean it in a crazy person way of \"oh we were all made as part of it\" but I mean that that they set all the the weird laws of physics as a 'code' with all particles and waves here being represented as data there and then let the Big Bang happen. And then the classic question from that would be \"well who made their universe?\" And then I'd think that it was 'programmed' in an even simpler and more logical universe that has the capacity to create a slightly more complex one and that it would keep going that way until you get to a universe that's a hypothetical idea, like an exact representation of logic.

        "answer": "oh my gosh, you are very in need of a very critical piece of advice and life experience that i must tell you. i have become quite certain, at least for me, that i should NEVER attempt to write a song in the studio. by that i mean, do not attempt to write your song while the recording software/equipment is open. That doesn't mean you can't, but what i have found is that most of the time, if i try to write a song in the 'recording studio', the result is exactly what you just described. this is exactly why, after experimenting a little with the 'write in studio' approach somewhere around 2011, i came to a firm realization that i MUST write and finish the song BEFORE bringing it to the official recording environment. so so important. Recording a song, has enough unknowns and challenges. not even knowing how it goes is WAY too many unknowns. my policy is, i must know how it goes, i need to know every word, every melody, chords, and what's also particularly important to me is that i have the exact 'road map', which means know exactly how long everything goes -- no uncertainty about the ending, no uncertainty about transitions, intros, etc etc, no uncertainty about how it gets from point a to point b. the whole roadmap must be known from beginning to end. not necessary to have every little auxiliary detail, not even necessary to know all the exact instrumental parts. but, you just need the exact melody, lyric, chord, full road map. and also important to have an exact tempo marking, to avoid what i call a 'tempo crisis.' This is just what i've found. not knowing this will cause things to crumble in the studio, at least that is definitely the case when working by yourself. This is not necessarily true for everyone, and i'm sure this approach is more applicaple to people doing the entire arrangement on their own (like me, and perhaps you too). and i'm aware that many many many people write songs in the studio, and i'm sure some people can do it just fine, but i have become quite sure that, for me, without a shadow of a doubt, the 'write first' approach is a must for me, and after reading your story i would strongly advise this for you also. i hope this helps"

        "question": "a \"friend\" of mine and I had a heated discussion because he thinks only what is previously imagined and rehearsed can be called \"music\", ruling out improvised music as being \"weaker\", \"inadequate to express feelings and touch people\", and \"not really music\" (his words). he thinks saying that two composers, one that studied a lot of music theory and one that doesn't have the same amount of theoretical/technical (related to mastering an instrument) knowledge, have the same right to call themselves composers and not be seen as being on different \"levels\" is devaluing and harmful to music and the development of musicianship. I, on the other hand, think art is not simply about knowledge and technique as it very much is about expression as well, and each artist is free to decide which tools they are going to use to express themselves and how. there's no need for \"levels\", \"better and worse\": there's no need to rank artists according to their ability, what' s the po int in having a \"caste system\" in art? who benefits from that? if he thinks knowing all that he can know about music theory is what works for him, that's great!, for him. but it doesn't mean everyone should follow the same path, otherwise they aren't \"actual musicians\". what gets me the most is he teaches childre music, and it hurts me to think how he might be one of those teachers I so deeply disliked when I was a kid: people who think they hold the Entire and Absolute Artistic Truth in their hands because they're adults and teachers and they studied some, and therefore they have the right and duty to trim kids' (and people in general's) thoughts. I know you are a person and your opinion is also subjective. I also know, from following you and your work, that you don't appear to be close-minded at all. maybe that's why I'm here: reassurance. I firmly believe in what I said about art: I think about it a lot and I change my mind, I try to be as open as I can to new ideas , but th ere's also a core value of art not needing to be constrained, and the importance of artistic freedom, that I keep throughout my life. but am I the unreasonable one in this situation? we are often blind to our own flaws, most of all when they touch us deeply. is that the case here? sorry for the wall of text.",

        "question": "hi Bill. You keep saying that you haven't released a video because you are learning how to make video. Did you forget that you made a bunch of videos on YouTube already? Do you have to relearn everything when you make a new video? Are you trying to change your style? Please elaborate. What do you have to learn? Thanks",
        "answer": "that's true i didn't make them on youtube. i made them offline, and then logged into youtube to post them when they were done. also posted them here on this site as well, and some other sites usually not, but that's what's happening now there are some basic advancements that seem to be inevitable, and it was actually a peculiar case of software obscelecense which triggered the transition, which was due to happen sometime anyway but i just wasn't sure when the core software that i was using for video production was discontinued, actually around 2012 (before i even started using it). but by the time i found out, i was already 2 or 3 years down the road of experience with it. so i was clinging to an old computer system, year after year, and couldn't update or i would have to relearn all the tricks and techniques i had accumulated. But, there's also a secondary piece of software that i've been using in addition, ever since about 2016, to do some of the 3D elements, and sometime last year when starting on a music video i just felt deep inside that i wanted to try starting off the entire video from the 3D program, just to see what happens. i've always known 3D is a nightmare mindfuck timesink, but something must have clicked in my biological timeclock or something, and i realized it was my destiny to just jump into it, and apply all the same principles of brutal simplicity that had allowed me first enter the video making realm (an equally impossible mindfuck, back then, having had no experience). So i fell hopelessly in love with this new realm, despite some of the unthinkable challenges, and then it occured to me that this is obviously the time when i am supposed to make the jump to a new system. there is literally every reason to do it, and equally many reasons 'not' to 'not' do it. it's kind of like going through puberty. your body says it's time to change and the change happens. and let's just say that the transition has set into motion so many more ridiculous and exciting developments than i had ever could have expected, and yet needed so desperetly all along. it's like when a tree grows for 10 years under a small shelf and then the shelf breaks and the tree suddenly explodes in an upward direction. could be awkward at first but you know it's gotta happen. if you've known me, you'll know i've been through this many times before"

        "question": "Ok I think I figured it out, like why you are taking so long. Basically whenever I do anything, I feel like I have to understand it perfectly, and not just like perfectionism but like a need to see how it all works from scratch. Like I'm making a computer translator, and basically I need medium to reflect semantics. But then I get so stuck on how semantics works and I still haven't continued coding cause I'm trying to understand the underlyingness of how things work. Or like if I have to do math work, I think of the nature of numbers, how almost all operations are defined recursively in the end including addition and all, and I don't get anything done for a long time. (I'm not trying to call myself smart; I really am a lazy dumbass in the end) But in the end it's good though and not a complete waste of time, cause it feels like you get it all even if countless people have thought of the same stuff before you. And also in the end this is practic al in so me way, as actually understanding is like building foundations for a house rather than being quick to build some that that you're not sure how it stays up. Even if the people who build without foundations are more efficient really. So my guess is that as you do these 3D stuffs, you're trying to understand the stuff cause glossing over it or trusting other's people's things without understanding them just that just feels wrong. I hope I don't sound like a psychologist or something assigning a guess, I'm really just guessing a guess.",
        "answer": "yes, i must admit, that is a trait i commonly have. but there are 2 parts to this. the second part is when i can't take it anymore and i flip out and go into emergency hyperdrive. if you've known me, i'm sure you've probably watched me go through these 2 phases again and again throughout my life. i think that's why it makes a lot of sense when my parents told me i was born a week late but also extremely suddenly"

        "question": "how did you make that color expanding across the land effect in HOJ and HOTEWIG?",
        "answer": "the trick is to take the image of the full map, duplicate the file, then use the lasso selector to outline what you want, copy, select all, delete, paste, then open a blank black image, select all, copy that, go back to the isolated territory file, then paste, undo, select all, copy, redo, paste. now you have an outlined territory on black background, on an image file the same exact size as another image which includes the whole map. then import both those images into your video timeline, and perform the movements you need, get the movements copied to both images, put the partially black one on top, then key out the black, edge feather, then tint the color. can also double layer and composite the cut-out one, as desired. to make it expand, you can use a simple crop line with edge feather, keyframed in before and after positions, or if you need it to go at an angle, you can use a rectangular mask shape at an angle. maybe even use a circular mask shape and have that expand. the key to the game is making sure your 2 images (one of the full map and one of just the territory on black background) are exactly the same dimensions, so that way you can easily apply the exact same movements to both of them. In a 3D environment such as history of the world, this is done with video files. render the globe moving as you want, with the full map on it, then replace the globe map with a same sized map with only the desired territory, and the rest black. re-render the exact same sequence, with exactly the same start and end time. then import both videos into your 2D timeline, and stack them, and key out the black, as before"

Guitar and bass and keys can record through an interface, but I don't know how to get quality audio from the acoustic instruments. (For most of them, the only mic around is in their phone) How can we get clean takes from that kind of limited setup?",
        "answer": "what stands out more to me in this situation are not concerns of acoustics, but concerns of how the band plays together (or, how to effectively simulate the phenomenon of the band actually playing together). one thing i will suggest is to do the drums first, so everyone else can hear the drums. that's just for the sake of the chemistry and the quality of everyone playing together. Actually, what i would really recommend is, after doing the drums first, send it to the chordal instruments, then send it to vocals, then send it to bass, then send it back to the drummer with drums muted and a very strong click (oh i forgot to mention you absolutely must have the click in there from the start), then send it back to the chordal instrument(s) and have them re-do that, with the new drums included, then maybe send it to bass to have that redone, then back to vocals, keep going around like this and have the people re-do their parts each time, because each time it gets closer and closer to creating the illusion of people actually playing together, because now they are hearing each other... even better, they are hearing each other do what they did while hearing each other. but i just realized you probably already knew all this. but as far as acoustics, just remember that some people spend millions of dollars on ways to try to deliberately simulate bad acoustics. hope that helps"

        "question": "Okay, so, the answer about the stacked same exact voicings per octave got me thinking: I can see how this technique could be useless in the context of a chord voicing spread throughout more than the space of an octave (at least), but what if I want to achieve some reinforcement over a certain voicing much like when some harmonic distortion is added to enrich or fatten a sound? Some mud may be necessary to be cut via EQing (if used in the wrong areas), but it seems like a valid production technique when trying to add some density while maintaining the harmonic colour, if you will. Also, may add some stereo dimension when taking panning into account. What do you say?",
        "answer": "absolutely, but it will NOT work if you use the exact same notes in a different octave. what you are trying to achieve will be achieved by using different notes, and i would be delighted to tell you which as octaves go up and down, you need different amounts of notes to re enforce the same exact sound you had. using the same exact 'notes' in different octaves will make the sound different, in fact dare i say will weaken it and add an 'ick' factor. if you tell me any notes and exactly what octave they are in, i will give you my best suggestion(s) of how to re enforce it while keeping the exact same flavor. you can even tell me how much distortion you happen to have on it. i promise you the answer will never be the exact same notes in a different octave..... that's just not what's gonna re enforce the original sound. the exception to this is if you started with only 1 note"

I know you're likely going to answer this with some sort of \"holy fishpaste the magnitude of friendliness is overwhelming\" and that's great I really like those answers and how they're always different but I hope you do read this and understand the sincerity of my thanks. I have always felt like there was this slight pretentiousness living inside me about the music that I like. Like if it didn't have extended harmony or weird changes or complicated rhythms it was stupid, but only SOMEWHAT. And I never really liked this about myself but it always felt true and I had a hard time liking other, lets just say more popular sounding music. But listening to your music has made a huge change within me. Like I would never have been into a song like New Canaan even a year ago but now here I am hearing the music and enjoying it and experiencing it like how music should be experienced! And I just feel so much more open to the worl d when i t comes to writing my songs and all the opportunities that are out there. I think I'm really just enjoying music the most I ever have right now, and I owe it all to you. It definitely has an impact on how I view the world as well. Everything seems better. So thank you Bill!!!",

(you may recall this from knobs on a music player for 'treble' and 'bass', but this is the more detailed version of that.) So now, if you listen to something, and you notice it has too much low, or too much high, or not enough low or not enough high, etc etc, now you might now what to do. but please don't use it if the sound already sounded fine. that's the golden rule"

        "question": "Bill, I have an issue. I like to make projects, cool little events, sometimes a little funny video, perhaps a map to a video game and so on. But for years I've been struggling with three big problems. First, when thinking about starting a project, I tend to struggle getting it started. In my mind I have this feeling that I know exactly what to do, but starting it just feels exhausting and I don't get things done. How do I kickstart myself to start those projects? Second, when I get things started, I have this bad trait where I work on projects marathon style. For example, I do something for multiple days nonstop, but if I take even a smallest pause (like one day), the project just freezes instantly. How do I get rid of this marathon mentality? Third, even if things are rolling, sometimes I start to think elsewhere. \"Damn, that's a great idea!\" New projects that I should absolutely do! But there's this other project I' m alread y working on and that would just give me extra work. How does one simply focus on one project at a time while maintaining other amazing, potential ideas?",
        "answer": "it sounds like you still don't know specifically enough, the first steps. what helps me is to put on my own tv show, even if it's not actually on tv. you are the host of the show, and on the show, you will discuss and figure out how the hell to do the thing you are trying to do. and it will be fun and exciting as the audience follows along with your quest very specific bookmarks will help. write down exactly where you left off. very very specifically exactly what the next exact thing is. keep an idea bank. add ideas to it. watch the bank grow out of control"

        "question": "PLEASE READ QUESTION THOROUGHLY So, on your reality, improv, and notebook pages I have noticed minutes in every AM hour (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 AM), as well as in every PM hour (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 PM) next to the dates you recorded the improv/reality/wrote the note. (I'm not wrong, CHECK any of those pages and see for yourself. billwurtz.com/reality for example) So that means you have at least once been awake in all those hours, and thus all hours (and most presumably minutes) of the day AND night. I know you sleep, because sleep is important (and multiple people already asked if you sleep), but my conclusion after seeing all these hours of the day AND night was: sometimes you sleep in the daytime, and sometimes you sleep at night, ANY hour, you name it, you have at least once been both awake and asleep (not on the same day) in that hour. Normal people sleep ONLY, EXCLUSIVELY at night. Thing is, I want to so metimes sleep in the daytime, and sometimes sleep at night like you, because I'm sick of the normal sleep-at-night routine, and I want to break the day-to-day loop. There's only one problem. When I sleep, I feel like I've skipped a certain period of time (usually 8 hours). This is caused by my brain being unconscious. However this only works at night for some reason. (I know what I said earlier, normal people sleep ONLY, EXCLUSIVELY at night, but I myself, in particular, can't deal with being stuck in the routine every day. It just feels like an infinite loop, and I'm sick of it.) Anyway, my question is: HOW do you sleep in the daytime (or did in 2008-2016 for example if you do not anymore)? I tried this, but I ended up being awake, bored, and with nothing to do for 8 hours, and I just keep telling myself to go to sleep until my sleep time period is over, and I tried my hardest to become unconcious, but nothing worked, so I had to wait out the time period minute by minute. Second by second. I repeat, my question is: HOW do you sleep in the daytime (or did in 2008-2016 for example if you do not anymore)? Before you decide to not post this question, PLEASE answer this question, because this is a serious issue, and I'm fed up with the normal only-at-night sleep schedule. And don't just decide to respond with \"good god this must have taken ages to write\" or anything off-topic. ANSWER the question, and tell all of us how you sleep/slept so unpredictably (sometimes in the daytime, sometimes at night), because, again, this is a serious issue (at least on my part), I'm fed up with the standard sleep-at-night day-to-day routine. Again, I'll repeat the main question at the end of this question so people reading this question don't get confused. How do/did you sleep so unpredictably? I'm specifically asking for how you sleep in the daytime? NO FUNNY ANSWERS LIKE THE 13 LEVELS OF SUFFERING THING. THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE FOR ME.",
        "answer": "are you suggesting that there is anyone in this world (of a medium age) who has actually never been awake at a certain time of the day i'm not so sure about that, especially since the invention of the light bulb yes, i admit, that can seem like a nuisance, but that's just the way we are i think you will find that sleeping becomes quite easy if you have already been awake for 16 hours or more this sounds like exactly the situation you would be in if you were trying to sleep after sleeping too recently, such as less than 14-16 hours ago. You yourself pointed out that you are not thrilled by sleep. so it is not a surprise to me that you are finding it impossible to sleep when you don't actually even want to i think you will find that sleeping becomes quite easy if you have already been awake for 16 hours or more i'm not seeing your argument that it is unpredictable. for example, look at the months. sometimes it's january. sometimes it's february. sometimes it's march. I think at one time or another, it has probably been every different month. Does that mean the months are unpredictable? maybe, but there is not sufficient evidence here if you want to sleep in the day, then by natural extension this means you would be awake at night. You have tried sleeping in the day, but from your story, it sounds like you had already been asleep the preceding night. which would naturally make it senselessly impossible to sleep during the following day. However, if you had been awake for the duration of the previous night, it seems it would be quite easy to sleep during the day. Have you considered trying that you have not provided any evidence that i sleep unpredictably i think you will find that sleeping becomes quite easy if you have already been awake for 16 hours or more"

What I often do is that I examine what the highest note of song is or the lead (vocal) melody. Then I let that be the high part of my range I know I can hit pretty comfortably. And then see what key that would make the song in. And then I might move the key up or down depending on what feels good. Does this sound like a good technique, Bill? That's what I've been using for years and it has worked for me.",

        "question": "I am not literate in music theory, so I am interested if you can bring insight to this conundrum. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0sCTj6hMsQ this is the soundtrack to the ending of a movie, where the protagonist kills herself. If you listen to the track, this may seem surprising; the music isn't what one might associate with such tragedy. People in the comment section are grappling as to whether or not this is 'sad' music, and trying to comprehend what a confusing feeling it is to listen. There is some consensus that this really just 'neutral' music, meant to convey the idea that death is neutral. This is how I myself understand it. There is one individual however, who is dead insistent and a bit aggressive that this is JOYOUS music simply because music theory says so. Major key == happy. Case closed. The fact that one is reminded of something separate should not be considered... This blunt use of music theory stresses me out a bit. Is that somewhat true? Or not? What are the boundaries of what's should be considered part of music. Can't remember, but I think you mentioned that your videos are quite an important part of the music but of course your okay with the song without video being distributed (mp3 file, streaming, etc).",
        "answer": "'major key == happy' is not quite true. you can easily make a dreadfully sad song in a major key. also, my opinion from listening to the music you linked, is that it is extremely joyous. not 'because it's in a major key', but because it simply sounds extremely joyous. from listening to it the way it sounds, and the feelings it evokes, from the sounds, when paired with whatever context it's in the songs must be able to survive without the video, but my non-song videos (videos which are not based on songs) need the video and audio together in order to work properly"

        "question": "How do I even begin to start learning how to make videos??? I tried just starting really simple using the programs built into my computer. And my goal was to make a video of just a black line moving horizontally across a white background. I used MS Paint, drew a line. Took a screen shot and saved it. Moved the line the tiniest smidge forward. Took another screen shot and saved it etc etc etc. Tried stringing all the screen shots together in MovieMaker for the final product. Well, it took me an ungodly amount of time to do this. I had to make and save approximately 1 zillion screen shots. And the final product was trash. It just looked like a choppy slideshow of a bunch of pictures of a line. No fluid motion (which was my goal). I don't know what to try now. I'm super frustrated and disheartened. My plan was to learn how to just make simple shapes moving across across a blank background and then gradually move forward towards more complex motion and m ore deta iled characters/backgrounds... But I can't even get a damn line to move across the screen with fluid motion. I know I'm not exactly using state of the art technology here but if I can't figure out how to do something extremely simple on an extremely simple program, investing in some fancy animation software probably isn't the smartest move... sorry for ranting at you, bill. I'm just upset.",
        "answer": "ah yes, this is the typical overwhelm that occurs in animated visual media. there is much much more overwhelm where that came from, but, there are also solutions. For this particular situation, you'll want to look for something called \"keyframes.\" Most video software has it. it will allow you to pick a point in time and space for the image to be, and then pick another point in time and space, and it connects them linearly (or, for your convenience and pleasure, sometimes it will do use a cringey curve algorhythm). If your software actually cannot do keyframes (which i think it can), i'm sure there is some other very basic and simple software that is within your budget that can"

        "answer": "i'm not entirely sure what you mean because it seems like some of the things you said go against other things you said ..... but if you are wondering how to record midi with a keyboard.... your keyboard needs to be a midi controller. and most of them are. in modern times that usually means you need to connect the keyboard with a USB cable, and then make sure you have the right MIDI driver installed on your computer (always available on the website for your keyboard.... so that would be the yamaha website, or korg website, roland, etc). and then you wanna tell your recording software that you are gonna record a MIDI track, not an audio track. then if you press record on a midi track, it will be listening for you to play your midi keyboard and it will record the midi data. and then you can use whatever sound you want, in the computer"

        "question": "4.20.20 4:54 pm I am curious about ideas generation process. When you have one idea on the piano, how long do you usually run with that? I've been getting back into creating music recently after a several years hiatus and I'm finding I am running with an idea for between 10 and 30 minutes or so before I can really move on to another totally different one. If i try earlier than that it is too similar. This is just idea Gen stage not songwriting so it feels way too slow. Any advice?",
        "answer": "if you are looking for ways to come up with more different ideas quicker, you could try using various random prompts. a random image. a random word. maybe even a random song, and make it a goal that you are going to write a song in some way related to that song but definitely not that song. or you could use a movie as a starting point. you could even have a totally different type of session where you just come up with different types of starting points. then another type of session where you go through each of the starting points you came up with, and use them. you can use anything as a starting point, but ironically what often happens is if you generate ideas for a while, even if you seem like you're not getting enough, often as soon as you stop and do something else the ideas will fall on you. the truth is that ideas are everywhere, in every molecule. at the rate of about a kajillion ideas per molecule. so if you ever think there are not enough, the ideas will wait for you to stop paying attention and then laugh in your face, flaunting their abundance at you. the question is will you be quick enough on the button, to catch them, regardless of whether you are in the shower, a business meeting, in court, ........ and if the answer is yes then you know you're really in the game"

Sorry, I don't mean to just dump my problems on you, but it seems like you've been through something similar to this... maybe?

Ive actually found that recording podcast has helped me have better conversations overall. Reminded me of you, by recording what you do, you probably start doing it outside of recording too in automatic. I am starting to have good-content quality conversations. I am just anxious about recording an episode with someone and having to tell them it doesnt fit my format and wont be released. (which ive done several times). its just easier to make that decision when its a just-me episode. I dont want people to make conclusions on their own capabilities as a guest if i decide its not on-format.",

        "answer": "don't elongate the list. just show the travel path geographically. if there are any moves that seem interesting to you, focus on those, and then speed up again through the 'boring' ones. which probably aren't boring if they are put all together. for example, if 12 moves go in an S pattern, don't focus on every indivisual move. focus on the S pattern. if 1 move takes 16 hours, focus on that one. etc. First thing to do is take a look at the itinerary and see what your thoughts are. the most important things to talk about, will probably be noticeable right away."

I haven't been having any real issues with singing for academic reasons, but I'm having trouble transitioning my singing voice to more casual, hobby-related stuff. The problem is, school has only taught me to sing like a member of a choir, when that's really one out of a billion different styles one could be singing. So I'm having trouble transitioning my choir voice into my more pop-related voice. It's become really hard to judge when I'm actually singing well, or when I sound absolutely terrible, just because I'm not used to judging this style of singing. Basically, how do you know when you've nailed down the vocals and got a great voice? Because I know you do!",
        "answer": "i would recommend improvising the lyrics for a while. that should give you some ideas if you like it, then it's good i try to make it so i like it, and if that never happens, i try to make it so i hate it the least. without spending too much time on it, because if you spend too much time in one vocal session, your mind melts and your voice actually gets bad"

I don't even know what to write about but I love music so much that I just have to make songs. what should I do?",
        "answer": "a good method people sometimes use for tuning a guitar string, is to bend it far out of tune, and then bend it gradually back up into tune. well, i think this might be a good strategy for songwriting, if you are feeling lost. Shoot way outside the boundaries of what anyone may think a 'song' is supposed to be..... and then gradually dial it back into more reasonable territory. i guarantee there will be some wild discoveries along the way"

Now I've gotten a really tiny bit better at translating my thoughts into music, but with that I've started noticing that most of my ideas are very slight variation of things I've heard in other songs, and the problem is it's often similar melodies or overall feeling and I feel like a thief... I guess imitation is the first (in my case second) step to learning to make good original music. What do you think? Am I on the right path?",

        "question": "how would you transcribe the rhythm of the singing at 0:22s in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QOOZk985l0 ? i'm thinking i should use a rubato marking or something because i imagine that's how the singer was thinking of it when she sung it, but still i don't know what the rhythm is that she's trying to deviate from. thanks",
        "answer": "what i would do, personally, if i wrote this and was trying to document it in order to be able to recall it later, using paper alone, .... And this might sound strange, but i might put quarter rest, then big bracket covering the second and 3rd beats, put a 5:4 tuplet, and inside that, start it with a rest. and put 4 notes, then probably another bracketed 5:4 tuplet in the next bar, and put the other 4 notes at the beginning of that tuplet, filling out the remainder with rests. Then, and this is very important, i would write \"lazily, wistfully\". This is what i would do if i were trying to message myself about how to deliver this, if i had just written it. However, in modern days, with recording technology so readily available, i would demo everything. The 5:4 tuplet, by the way, is not entirely accurate, and possibly not even the closest thing to exactly 'accurate' in terms of time, and when the notes actually occured, ... but, the reason for using such a strange tuplet is to remind myself when reading that this is a rhythm that doesn't quite align with the time grid, AND, (very imporant) that combined with the descriptive marking 'lazily, wistfully', would hopefully be enough to jog my memory. but then again, if you write a 5:4 tuplet for a stranger, their head might explode. luckily, most any time a singer learns a song, they rely heavily on audio references. that's just the only way to get it right"

I can solf\u00e8ge my way through figuring out the melody of a song based on my experience as a vocalist, but cannot figure out the chords of a song at all. there are just too many notes playing at once, but I would like to learn how to learn songs by ear. any advice? sorry if this has been asked before, you know how it is",
        "answer": "go through about 50 of your favorite songs, and identify each chord with brute force. quickly unpause/pause (or nowadays you can edit to loop a tiny fraction of audio very quickly) and just pick it out note by note and put it together. write down all the chords to a song (in time, with bar lines, etc.)..... once you do this for about 30 or 40 songs, i think you will find that you don't have to search for the individual notes anymore. ... maybe not even pause it at all. After about 100 more songs, you probably won't even have to listen to the song, you will be able to do it from memory. after about 1000 songs, you will probably be able to hear someone singing the melody for a song you have never heard before, without hearing the chords, and figure out what the chords should be. after 10,000 songs, you should be able to play chords along with them on the first try, never having heard the song before, and have them think you already knew the song"

        "question": "whats the divisibility rule for seven and eleven again? i keep on forgetting",
        "answer": "there's no rule, but there's a strategy. for example, take 43288. to see if it's divisible by 7, modify it by 7s until you recognize it as divisible by 7 or not. and you can also divide by anything, if that's convenient. Right where it is, we can subtract 28, which will knock off a zero. 43260, and divide by 10. is 4326. this seems way easy to cut in half, which is a legit transformation, but for now i'll skip that. if you want, you could add 14, to get 4340 -->434. then subtract 14, is 42. bingo, that's a multiple of 7. so 43288 is divisible by 7. another strategy would be to cut it in half several times first, if that feels convenient. 43288 looks pretty easy to cut in half. just look at it like 4 32 88. and cut everything in half. 2 16 44. then again, 1 08 22. look at it like 108 22, now again, 54 11.... So from there, you could add 49 to even it off, or, here's another trick, you can go from the left, it's sometimes much faster. if you can think of a multiple of 7 that's close but below any of the left of the number, you can replace that with the distance away it is. For example- looking at 5411, i can see 54 on the left, and that's clearly 5 above 49. Well you can just replace 54 with 5. 511. Now, you can do it again, just look at 51, clearly 2 above 49. so knock off the 51 and replace it with 2. so you get 21. which is clearly a multiple of 7. so that means the original number was also a multiple of 7, because we have only made transformations which will not destroy its status of whether or not it is a multiple of 7. Here's the 'left' method again from the original 43288, without doing all the cutting in half, just to show that it works that way too. 43288, you can clearly see the 43 is 1 above 42. so replace the 43 with just 1. so 1288, and now you can see 12 is 5 above 7, so replace 12 with 5. 588. 58 is just above 56 (2 away), so replace 58 with 2, that's 28. so it works that way too. often going from the left is much quicker. Another example, checking 43288 for 11, well right away just knock off the 88. that's 432. seems easy enough to subtract 22 from the right, so 41. so no. To cheat and show you an example that works, let's check 417521302 for 11. Seems easy to add 88 to the right, that's 417521390, drop the zero is 41752139. now add 11 to the right, 4175215. (dropping zeros as i go, of course). now add 55 to the right, 417527. now add 33 to the right, 41756. now add 44 to the right. 41800, drop zeros, 418. add 22 is 440 = 44, which you should recognize as a multiple of 11. Going from the left may have been quicker but i was actually just too lazy to compare 41 with 33. But if we had done that, from the original 417521302, it would have gone like this-- replace 41 with 8 (because 33 is 8 below 41-- and this only works when 33 is BELOW 41, in otherwords you can't replace with 3 here (44) that won't work). 87521302. You can replace 87 with 10 (87 is 10 above 77) 10521302. you can replace 105 with 6 (because 105 is 6 above 99). 621302. you can replace 62 with 7 (it's 7 above 55). 71302. you can replace 71 with 5 (because it's 5 above 66). 5302. you can replace 53 with 9 (because it's 9 above 44). 902. And you can replace 90 with 2 (because it's 2 above 88). so you're left with 22, which you should recognize as a multiple of 11"

Basically you play a chord that \"means\" one thing in the previous key, but means something else in the new key, so the listener follows the chord thinking it belongs to the previous key but surprise! it leads them somewhere else. If you'll forgive me the crude approximation, it's a little bit like a \"your mom\" joke, in that the same words suddenly get a whole new context. Am I making any sense? I'm sure there's a lot more to it, so if you've got any wise words I'm listening. Thanks!",

Should i fight myself to produce the old songs or should I just go with the flow and not think about it?",

        "answer": "it may take a while, but what i would recommend as a starting point is simple mediums with instant turnaround time. Like an empty text file. are you good at typing? an empty text file is an instant artistic playground. if you don't like typing, a blank piece of paper is great too. Some combination of journaling, and free artistic expression. this will give you some instant results, and also help you discuss things and gradually start lining up all your ducks in a row. To truly fulfill your true potential, there's gonna be a lot of moving parts, software, techniques, .... a lot of frameworks need to be developed over time. But if you stick to these simple mediums like glue, you can develop your expressions and keep a journal through your journey and it will very much keep your eye on the prize. that's what i've done ...... and am still doing now more than ever, to this day, because i still have a long, long, long, long way to go"

        "question": "My pressing question is if you, Bill Wurtz, have the capability to predict the future? The reason I am making this strange claim is because on September 18th, 2018 in a video titled Mount St. Helens is about to Blow Up, you recalled that the Dow Jones had gone down to zero. Now your videos are extremely philosophical, so at what point had you imagined a time that the Dow Jones went down to zero? Did it have similar parallels to the Corona Virus pandemic? If you do have the capacity to predict the future, if so, when is the sky green and gold? How are my kids? Is bacon still a thing? Does the moon still taste like cheese? Does everyone drive blimps? Thank you, sincerely, Sir Pull Ed Pork.",
        "answer": "the time known as 'the end of the world' i was going to say no but now that i think about it yes at night time, in Alaska maybe i don't know barely cheese which expired billions of years ago the blimps are self driving and you hire them on a blimp sharing app"

        "question": "In your song \"i just did a bad thing\", did you expect some of the events described to be semi-realistic, as in the events of 2020, and COVID-19? If not at all, can you tell [us] some details on the inspiration of the song, and the meaning on the lyrics? It would also be nice to have a bit of detail on your song \"long long long journey\", too!",
        "answer": "yes any time no, i had no idea about that. that didn't exist yet it originally came from a deliberate song idea generation session, let's just say ..... it was not the brightest flower of the bunch. i kind of just noted down the first line, and said 'meh'.... just did a bad thing, whatever, i guess that works. and threw it into the pile. Fast forward a few weeks later, during 'song selection' time, for the next song recording, and i had picked my semi-finals from the list, i think it was about 27 semi finalists (from a list of hundreds), and here's where i made a crucial mistake. i thought it would be a good idea to go around again, for a second round of elimination. Turns out that's a bad idea, and this is probably exactly the moment that i learned this. What happened was, i ended up eliminating them all. So, being on a hasty 2-week production schedule at the time, i realized i had but mere moments to spare, i hastily reversed back to the 27 semi-finalists, and out of spite / reverse psychology of some kind, i picked what i felt was the 'weakest' idea in that list. because i was so frustrated at myself for having eliminated all of them in the second round, i just wasn't trusting my 'opinion' anymore, so i just figured whatever is in that list of 27 has already been picked as one that i wanna do, so just to spite myself, i picked 'bad thing' because it was probably one of the least developed (one line) and i was least attached to it. i can't exactly explain my reasoning any other way, other than a bit of frustration and spite. Everything after that, as they say in the gravy business, is gravy. Because with the selection finalized, the remainder of the writing process is inspired by 1 thing only, which is trying to make the best song i can from what i have. which, in this case, since the first line i had was the first line of the song, means playing the first part and just trying to imagine how the next part would go, and so on, from there. heavily relying on my go-to techniques of 'making things up' and 'using my imagination'. Another thing i will mention is, when i got to the 'hey what's the name of this game' section, i was very pleased with that section, but the more i was trying it, i started to really feel like that belonged in a different song instead. I was sure it was never going to work. but i think after trying haplessly to come up with an alternative, i used another go-to technique i have, which is when you're stuck, always go with the first option you had, because at this point it's the best thing you're gonna get, and it's probably destiny anyway the chorus was written first. i believe there were 2 writing prompts at play there. a random word selection (always 2 words), it was 'campaigning' and 'stress', and also i believe there was also a musical prompt which is to use a 4415 based chord scheme at the top of the chorus. It appears that that song 'selection' occured on the same day as the original idea session. this is common, because when starting a new song process, first i do a series of new idea genration sessions, and then, separate from that, i do a song selection process (where i select which one is recorded) which can include the entire list of all song ideas, not just from that session. But quite often, the newer ones win, because for whatever reason they might be stronger and feel more relevent. So that one was selected, and it certainly was not more than a chorus (i think the chorus was probably fully written at the time of the selection, but nothing else). So, as with the other example, everything that happens after that is just part of the songwriting process, where i know that that's the song i'm doing. so i have to just put in the work to get it where it needs to be. So in this case, it's 'chorus was written first', which is always strange and quite a backwards puzzle to do, especially if you determine that the chorus does not go at the beginning of the song. Often in those cases, the verse solution will arrive melodically first, with almost no lyric. and i think this was definitely the case here, and it seemed to want to be something like \"i still remember the first day that...?' ... or 'i remember the..first..?? something'. I recall rattling around for quite some time trying to find something powerful enough to be the first line. and i believe, as is so often the case, it was in the shower that the actual solution arrived, 'i remember the moment that my dreams were broken.' And from there, as always, it's just the regular forward writing process as usual, trying to figure out the best way for it to go on a moment to moment basis after that"

        "question": "Can you explain to me the difference between 6/8 and 3/4? I've always been told, \"yes they look the same but they're not and its important that you know that\" but I've never actually understood what was so different about them other than eighth notes instead of quarter notes. Also, my cat says hello.",
        "answer": "a mathematical guideline for time signatures, supposedly, is that the top number is how many beats per bar, and the bottom number is what note is a beat. So, by that logic, 2/4 means 2 beats per bar, and a 4th note (quarter note) gets 1 beat. By the same logic, 7/2 (as if anyone ever uses that, which they don't) would mean 7 beats per bar, and a Half note gets one beat. But, here's the thing: usually, in actual reality, when the bottom number is 8, the eighth notes are usually going by too fast to actually 'feel' like a beat. But by the sheer logic of the 'beats' rule as described earlier, 6/8 *would* mean, 6 beats per bar, and the 8th note gets one beat. But, almost always, in actual reality, 6/8 is actually fast enough that it's actually felt as if the dotted quarter note gets the beat. So that would make it 2 beats per bar, and 3 8th notes per beat. So really, to properly follow the system, that would mean your top number should be 2, and the bottom number should be...um.... some kind of decimal (let me perform some calculations)... the bottom number would have to be about 2.6667. So really, in actually reality, the way 6/8 is usually felt, it should more accurately be called 2/2.667. But that would cause chaos all over society, so it's not written that way. But getting back to the difference between 3/4 and 6/8-- if you set your metronome to 120bpm, and count in groups of 3 clicks, let's say that's 3/4 at \u2669=120. Now set the metronome to 80bpm, and count in groups of 2 clicks, and subdivide each beat into 3, so like imagine you are counting 8th note triplets in 2/4. 3 triplets per beat, 2 beats per bar. but, plot twist, imagine the small notes are actually 8th notes, and you are living in a universe where there is 3 8th notes per beat, and each beat is a dotted quarter note. This is what it would feel like to be in 6/8, and the tempo marking would be \u2669. = 80. In 6/8 (or 12/8) the tempo marking is often marked in terms of a dotted quarter note. So anyway, to conclude, this is not written in any 'rule', but this is just the way it is in the real world -- 6/8, 12/8, and often 9/8, are counted as if the beat is happening on dotted quarter notes. again, the reason being that no one wants to write 2/2.667. And, you may be thinking, why not just put the song in 2/4 and use triplets, or maybe just 4/4, and use triplets. And this is a valid argument, and like i always say, when you are faced with a song with some kind of triplet or quick 3 feel, you just have to ask yourself whether you would prefer to be writing a lot of dots (for all the 'regular' beats which will have to be dotted) OR a lot of the number 3 (for all the triplets). It's a personal decision, and the more you get out there and see the kind of charts that are circulating in your world or community, you can make the decision based on what you think would be most familiar to your reader(s)"

        "answer": "have you used any compression (not file compression, that's different, i'm talking about the thing that automatically adjusts the volume so it's always about the same). Using compression on various tracks, especially the vocal, and also some on the master, will help this very much. But the funny thing about compression is, you can't just 'turn it on' and expect it to work, you have to tweak it quite a bit until you get it so it's even really doing anything. Check the gain reduction meter to confirm whether it's doing anything. you can check out some tutorials about this i'm sure. Basically what it does is it's like you hired a gnome to very quickly adjust the volume of a track (such as the vocal, or maybe the entire song) in small amounts to prevent the volume from being so all over the place. turns it up when it gets quiet, and turns it down when it gets loud. Not so much to ruin all the variances, but enough to keep it from poking out sometimes and disappearing other times. forgive me if you already are doing this. but this sounds like the most obvious answer to the situation you are describing"

        "question": "Thank you! That was helpful advice about mixing. So, if I can ask again, is it your preference to do all the settings for compression manually, or to tweak a preset compression? I don't know what type of program you use but are those presets helpful? Anyway, I'm excited to keep learning and improving!",
        "answer": "here's what i would do. set the 'make up gain' to zero, just to eliminate confusion. In the early days, i would add compression on the default setting, and it had like 4db of makeup gain on it. so i was assuming it was doing something. but it wasn't enough, because some parts were still too loud/soft. so i still had to do extensive manual adjustments to the volume (not compression, just drawing a line to adjust the volume over time. very tedious, but worth it.) Then one day i finally realized that the compression actually wasn't doing anything, it had just given a 4db boost which tricked me into thinking it was doing something. so maybe get rid of the makeup gain, just so you know what you're dealing with. if your compressor has a visual representation (like a slanted line, etc), that's great. Basically the whole trick is, look at the 'gain reduction' meter. That should be a little light or something that will tell you when it's actually cutting the volume. and it should tell you at each moment how much it is actually reducing the sound. Set your ratio (that's how steep the slant is) set that to maybe..... 2:1? 3:1? it depends on what you're using it for, what instrument, or whatever. that is how slanted it is. Basically 1:1 means it's doing nothing. if you look at the visual representation it should be a perfect 45deg diagonal line. that means it's doing nothing. 2:1 or 3:1 will be less steep. But you should also see a bend in the line..... it will be exactly 45degrees below a certain point, and then it should bend, to be what your ratio is (so probably less steep). Now if you adjust the threshold, it should move that bend point up and down. if you move the bend point down, it means it's squashing more of the sound... like even the quieter parts. If you move the threshold up, it should be doing Less, and only squashing the loudest parts. as you move the threshold up and down, you should notice the gain reduction meter doing more, or less. As you move the threshold down, you should see the gain reduction meter coming on a lot more often, and you'll probably hear what it's doing. you'll hear the sound being squashed-all the loud parts will be squashed down to the same volume as the medium parts (somewhat, depending on the steepness of your ratio). so just adjust the threshold up and down until you get what you want. The trick is, if the gain reduction meter is doing nothing, then you can be sure nothing is happening. so definitely change it until you see some action there, otherwise it's doing nothing. then of course, once you get that right, you'll have to bring up the makeup gain. because it will have made the overall volume mostly lower. that's why presets will probably not work right, because it doesn't know how loud your material is. so you have to play around until you 'find' where the volume levels are on your track, and so it can be acting appropriately to curb the peaks just the right amount. hope that helps"

        "question": "do you ever feel like youve got a mix down pat but then you listen to the result over a phone speaker and it sounds awful? im working with making purposefully lobit music and theres a couple of tunes that sound lovely through headphones and proper speakers but absolutely dire through phone speakers, like theres this horrible harsh scraping sound made whenever a mid/high frequency tone plays. have you any tips on this stage of the mixing process? any compromises i should consider?",
        "answer": "just be aware that nothing in the low frequency range will exist on the phone. also another thing to help put it in perspective, if someone mostly listens to music through a pancake speaker (phone speaker, tablet speaker, something flat like a pancake, with no bass, etc), they might be used to that sort of sound. so while you might be shocked, a certain amount of that is just you being shocked about the sound of the speaker. but that being said, you should also try to avoid any situations where the only significant thing happening is a low frequency thing. Another approach, which i used to swear by before i actually tried it, is starting your entire arrangement on a pancake soundsystem. or just make an EQ pancake simulation, like this. I would recommend doing that IF you think your audience will ONLY listen to it through the pancake, and never with anything else. but if you know that some of the audience will be hearing the bass, then you're gonna have to go back in and fix major problems because your bass will probably be exploding. I've tried this strategy once and it didn't go well. I think the best solution is to have an easy switching system where you can check the pancake, regular, and just check many types of speakers very quickly, at all times during production, including at the very beginning when you are first starting the arrangement"

        "question": "So i've developed a weird habit to make my head feel better. it started off as \"night walks\" and progressed to \"long scary night walks\"; picking places that are scary. i think this is because i have a need to feel strong and brave. after that it progressed to walking places i'm sorta not supposed to be, recently it has progressed to what is technically \"criminal trespassing\". there is a country club type place a few blocks from where i live, and i've been hopping the fence (it's short) and walking around a small part of the grounds for a minute and then leaving. this is very exciting to me cause i've spent my whole life being a baby afraid of authority and conflict, been fighting that since i was a teenager. These night walks are helpful for making my head feel better, But it doesn't seem all good. i get this really demanding nagging tension to keep doing More, and if i don't i'm gonna be a timid weakling who comes in last forever etc. Right now it want s me to run through the entire grounds. It doesn't seem like it ends. you just feed it and then it wants more. So the thing about the nice 'i can walk outside and do whatever i want\" feeling from goin' trespassing is it's fun and then i come down and am faced with The Usual(my ugly face and shit brain that wants to hurt me). I do a lot of music and words and started drawing recently. those are the things i REally care about, in a nice way. the things i think can save me. I'm not sure what i'm trying to ask. I guess i won't die getting caught walking around a country club and my brain plays up the actual stakes as high as it can. but that would feel so unbelievably stupid For a While after dealing with cops and paying whatever that way too big fine would be. it's like a distraction but it has legitimacy cause of how big and deep the nice feeling is after, if only for a minute. But then there is all the bad feeling inbetween. I guess i question how helpful it is vs how dumb it is. i'v e been talking it out with myself and im struggling to deal with these feelings and what i should do about them",
        "answer": "it sounds like you are doing fine. don't forget, writing/drawing and all those other mediums you use, those are actually great opportunities for thrill seeking also"

You may have assumed it means \"add9\", but if it's add 9, it really shouldn't say + because that is a symbol for augmented, and also, because it was Bm7, it also includes the 7, and \"add9\" usually means you add 9 without having the 7. where as if you wanted to keep the 7 it would be just Bm9. Also, possibly, this confusion could have been avoided by saying Bm7(#9). But according to my best reasoning, i determined that it was nearly 100% likely that the person meant aug9 or sharp9 and not 'add 9', based on all the charts i have seen throughout my life time"

        "question": "how to make music that people will actually like?",
        "answer": "the most important thing to do is to make music that you actually like. a secondary strategy is to also listen to music that other people like. Now, you may have mis-read that and are now thinking \"oh ok, you're saying i should listen to music that other people might like and then maybe try to make music like that, even if i don't necessarily like it\" NO, absolutely not, that is not what i'm saying. When it comes time to make your music, you must do it exactly according to your own wildest dreams. But before that, on a different day maybe, in a different season, in a totally different section of the building, you were just casually listening to music that other people might like, purely for the hopes of finding more things that YOU like. This really has nothing to do with the 'making music' part, the listening is actually just for enjoyment. When it comes time to make the music, actually you might as well try to do something you like that sounds totally different from anything else you've heard before. or the same. it's irrelevant whether it's different or the same. but the important thing is when it comes time to make the music you have to do it the way you like. So you may be thinking, \"so, you're saying i should just make the music i like and it doesn't matter if anyone else likes it\" No, that's still not quite what i mean. what i mean is, making music that you really fully like is probably the ONLY reliable way TO actually guarantee that others will like it. Now still, you may also be thinking \"so what are the benefits of trying to make music that you DON'T like, but you THINK others will like.\" Well, i think i can safely say that this does not actually get anyone to like it, but, this is where the confusion arises, it might make OTHER people THINK that someone ELSE may like it. so that's good for a free lunch somewhere maybe, but it will be a lousy lunch and does not compare to the lifetime of grade A lunches you can get if you ultimately just cut out the middle man and make the music you know is best"

Is it weak to seek a second opinion because it might ruin the genuine me-ness of the project?",
        "answer": "what usually works is to hear it again for the first time after not hearing it for a while. however, the problem with this is it wastes time. in general, it will probably help to try to complete the project in a relatively swift and quick manner. the doubt tends to get worse as the project goes on that's not quite right, i believe that you must make what you like, but, doing this will also naturally cause others to like it. making what you like, i believe, is the only way to actually end up with something that anyone else will like. so in that case, doing what ONLY you like is probably impossible actually good is more like a feeling. music can bring these feelings, but there are a lot of factors involved with what actually causes which feelings and when and why no"

Then the recording process becomes a fun adventure for how you are going to deliver the song, and you already know the agenda for every part (every bar, not instrument) of the song. forgive me if you already do this. if you have, then my answer would be different"

Literacy, on the other hand, is something totally different. that's just knowing how most of the world writes things down, in case you ever want to read or write things to or from other people. that much i'm sure you could learn on google in about 10 seconds (assuming you already are familiar with music), but google wasn't around back when i learned it...... might have been some books lying around, but i picked it up easily (because i was already familiar with music)"

        "question": "I'm sure you've gotten this question before but I don't understand the difference between 3/4 and 6/8 (time signatures)? Is it just the triplets? People (music teachers) always seem to emphasize how it's important that we know they're different but they never actually explain what the difference is.",
        "answer": "a mathematical guideline for time signatures, supposedly, is that the top number is how many beats per bar, and the bottom number is what note is a beat. So, by that logic, 2/4 means 2 beats per bar, and a 4th note (quarter note) gets 1 beat. By the same logic, 7/2 (as if anyone ever uses that, which they don't) would mean 7 beats per bar, and a Half note gets one beat. But, here's the thing: usually, in actual reality, when the bottom number is 8, the eighth notes are usually going by too fast to actually 'feel' like a beat. But by the sheer logic of the 'beats' rule as described earlier, 6/8 *would* mean, 6 beats per bar, and the 8th note gets one beat. But, almost always, in actual reality, 6/8 is actually fast enough that it's actually felt as if the dotted quarter note gets the beat. So that would make it 2 beats per bar, and 3 8th notes per beat. So really, to properly follow the system, that would mean your top number should be 2, and the bottom number should be...um.... some kind of decimal (let me perform some calculations)... the bottom number would have to be about 2.6667. So really, in actually reality, the way 6/8 is usually felt, it should more accurately be called 2/2.667. But that would cause chaos all over society, so it's not written that way. But getting back to the difference between 3/4 and 6/8-- if you set your metronome to 120bpm, and count in groups of 3 clicks, let's say that's 3/4 at \u2669=120. Now set the metronome to 80bpm, and count in groups of 2 clicks, and subdivide each beat into 3, so like imagine you are counting 8th note triplets in 2/4. 3 triplets per beat, 2 beats per bar. but, plot twist, imagine the small notes are actually 8th notes, and you are living in a universe where there is 3 8th notes per beat, and each beat is a dotted quarter note. This is what it would feel like to be in 6/8, and the tempo marking would be \u2669. = 80. In 6/8 (or 12/8) the tempo marking is often marked in terms of a dotted quarter note. So anyway, to conclude, this is not written in any 'rule', but this is just the way it is in the real world -- 6/8, 12/8, and often 9/8, are counted as if the beat is happening on dotted quarter notes. again, the reason being that no one wants to write 2/2.667. And, you may be thinking, why not just put the song in 2/4 and use triplets, or maybe just 4/4, and use triplets. And this is a valid argument, and like i always say, when you are faced with a song with some kind of triplet or quick 3 feel, you just have to ask yourself whether you would prefer to be writing a lot of dots (for all the 'regular' beats which will have to be dotted) OR a lot of the number 3 (for all the triplets). It's a personal decision, and the more you get out there and see the kind of charts that are circulating in your world or community, you can make the decision based on what you think would be most familiar to your reader(s)"

For example I can point out an E because it is the first note in the melody of Outside the Wall but it doesn't just sound like an E. Like it doesn't work for notes that I haven't associated a song or melody with. Is this something that I can develop or should I just stick to drums",
        "answer": "ah, that is the eternal question, for ney sayers and yes sayers alike exactly absolute pitch was never where the music is. so i guess it depends whether you want to stick to music. Could do absolute too, for sport i guess"

(the song was actually supposed to be called \"it's the first day of school\", but then i decided i'd rather not have something that sounds like such a nursery rhyme. especially after recently releasing 'at the airport terminal' which nearly actually is a nursery rhyme) At the time i was positively sure i was finally going to succeed at doing a 1 week schedule, which i had been pushing fervently for for several months already, and i wrote the next song extremely fast, pretty much on pace for 1 week schedule, but, as always, a couple days into song production i realized that 1 week is wildly impossible, as always. so then, as usual, taking it slightly slower, did some re-writes, and finished the recording in an average amount of time (similar production time as the previous 2 songs) but then, when i started on the video, let's just say there was a little tickle in my mind that was possibly trying to get my attention during the entire 2-week blitz schedule but knew it wasn't welcome, because in the 2 week schedule it would have been impossible..... but i decided to listsen to it, this time. and what the voice was saying is, 'one of these days you should actually START a video in 3D instead of just sprinkling little bits of 3D in. or else you're never going to really get any better at it.' so i did it for half a scene and it blew my mind, then did it for a couple more half scenes, and it changed my life"
