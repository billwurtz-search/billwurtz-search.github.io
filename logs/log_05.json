        "answer": "for that one i already knew what i was doing because i had already done history of japan, which was the exact same process but much smaller in scale. history of japan however was still much larger than any other project i did before, so i was somewhat surprised that it went so smoothly, but nonetheless i had still done a huge amount of videos before then, so my processes were well under control by then. if you produce a lot of work you learn everything you need to know automatically. if you start with very small sized products you will learn very quickly and easily"

        "question": "Hey. I've been feeling pretty terribly lately. I'm just really overwhelmed by being human- you know- the fact that you're required to go to school, and expected to go to college and if you don't you're considered a failiure, the pressure of my family to dedicate my life to school because they tell me that if I don't, I'm going to be poor. And I'm attempting to be a good artist only to fall on my face. And I try to run away from these terrible feelings through video games and I even fail at that too. So I'm going through a pretty rough time. I don't even know what to do to help myself. But thank god it's nighttime. I can't stand the daytime because I'm surrounded by an environment that I hate and whenever I open my eyes I can see every single inch of it. I guess to comfort myself in these times I just go underneath my blankets and distance myself from the world and type to you. I just really want to feel better but I don't know how. Actually, I'd feel a lot b etter if I knew that I can succeed in the future without college and if I could be comfortable talking to my parents about my feelings. And i had a car so I can just leave my house and distance myself from everything I hate about this world. I think that's how I can truly be happy you know- being confident in the future and in yourself. I'm a bit hesitant to go all in and have a whole bunch of confidence that if I get better at art I'll be all set in life. I mean even if I'm wrong, I might as well try, right? It's better than just sitting here extremely afraid and sad. And i feel like I can learn a lot from it all- I mainly think that being good at art would be what makes me joyous and feel fulfilled in life because I love expressing myself. But if I can express myself in a more moving and beautiful way like through music and drawing, I think I'll have a blast. I can express myself in ways that have never been done before. But I have to learn first. I have to get really good and experienced to be able to express myself through song the way I want to. So maybe I can type out my feelings in the meantime you know? And still continue to learn the mechanics but still express myself. And then when I get to the point where I'm super confident in my ability, I'll attempt to express my deep feelings through music. Music is my main goal. I'm going to listen to some music before going to sleep. Bye.",
        "answer": "a large percentage of the world's most successful people dropped out of college or didn't go i think you may get better results if you think more in terms of strengthening your force field, rather than trying to escape. i think if you escape in a car you may feel trapped in a car. cars are small. if you need to leave, you can walk ... sometimes that feels better than driving anyway actually sometimes the most true and powerful expressions occur before you have barely learned anything. and at the same time, no amount of experience will ever be enough to express anything 'perfectly' unless you adopt the view that everything is perfect (which is a fine view) in which case that's great news because that means anything you could possibly do would be perfect even if it wasn't quite what you were expecting (kind of like people) if you are waiting for 'confidence' before 'attempt' you might be doing this backwards"

But I stare at a blank piece of paper and then my mind just goes blank and then I'm like \"how the fuck am I supposed to express my feelings through a pencil? Do I create a new character?\" And then I freeze up and my mind freaks out like this: jdgdhsjshshsjsj and I stop at the idea of a character and I'm like ahhhhh. And now I realize how stupid I've been. I should just doodle and not give a fuck about what happens. Just express it- even if it isn't clear. And I've been so scared to do something wrong because I want to be so much like the other people I look up to that are able to create cool stuff. But if I look at how I'm feeling at the moment, It doesn't even feel right to make \"cool stuff\" it feels right to express my anger and fear and confusion. And with music it's sorta similar- I can improvise sometimes and I love the way I'm able to do it. And other times I just mess up and just struggle and freak out again like ahsbsbdhddhdh yeah I'm not perfect at all. But pfft atleast I'm looking at how stupid I am and realizing how stupid I am. Yeah bill sorry for being stupid. I vent on here and I look back and I'm like holy shit I was really really fucking stupid. Ha. Ok I'm going to take my advice now and make some art that's kinda stupid but honest if that makes sense. Bye.",
        "answer": "no, something much simpler. like start by putting a dot on the page and that's all you're allowed to do, but the one freedom you do have is you can choose anywhere on the page to put the dot. really try to go wild with that one decision. then put a time stamp on it and call it a day. i think you will be amazed at how many unique locations there are for just 1 dot. really makes you think about the shape and size of the page doesn't it. bonus, see if you can find a crazy place to put the date everyone is stupid. it's fun"

I'm upset of that because I feel like I really need to just get away from all of the things that depress me. Because to tell you the truth, I don't want to be here anymore. It makes me terribly sad that I can't do anything about my current situation. Because I'm just a teenager that can't even be trusted with making my own decisions. I'm sad because I don't want to be here anymore with my family- I want to be alone and just express myself freely. I really just want to die. I can't wait till I'm an adult to just leave. I can't. But if I decide to just get away from everything, then I'll get punished. I'm so scared and angry that I can't even do a simple thing that you reccomened to me- to just take a walk. Fuck! Last time I decided to take a walk.... let's just say it was a terrible between my parents and I. I can't be myself. And that upsets me and makes me miserable.

        "question": "have you ever experienced something like having your emotions shut off? i am getting very frustrated because i love(d?) music and art and life so much but now all my favorite songs feel empty. all i get out of them are vague recollections about what they were supposed to have made me feel, rather than the actual feelings themselves. this is making me feel disgusted and it is making me feel a great sense of loss because i wanted to be a musician and i guess i still want to be but i can't feel anything positive. when i play something i can't tell if it's good or not because i can't tell if i'm creating the feeling i want or not because i can't feel the feelings. am i going to spend the rest of my life without feeling the joy of music ever again? i really don't want this to happen to me. what if i'm doomed to be like this forever. i can feel boredom, loneliness, and crushing hopelessness, and that's pretty much it. maybe i'm depressed. am i depressed? i can sort of feel amused but that's not the same thing as like real joy and happiness. i really miss the feeling of awe.i used to look at the sky and the clouds and the stars and feel so much awe. why are my feelings so broken. it's like everything i cared about is now so far away. it seems like you like to suggest walking for dealing with crappy feelings, and that indeed used to be my go to method as well, but even walking feels empty. what can i do? i'm sad. also am i being overly dramatic? i hate being that one person who can't deal with their shit as well as most other people and then goes off and complains about how bad their life is. but i really don't know what to do. thanks for reading bill.",
        "answer": "not usually, but there is a continuous rotation that occurs, usually if you think something has 'shut off' it's actually just rotated or shifted slightly, and you need to adjust to the new configuration time to find some new ones it's time to find some new songs no that is unlikey not necessarily try something completely brand new according to Drama, and its Respectable Limits you are averaging about 3.2 a good next step would be imagining how you want your life to be. there are many different steps after that but that is the first step"

        "question": "Man, I just feel sad. Like for a while my mood has just been on a decline. I haven't been diagnosed for any mental disorders but lately I've just been constantly thinking about the fact that I've just moved schools in term 2 of grade 11 and I'm not close to my tiny class of like 10 people and I don't really relate to them as friends. I have an extremely tight group of friends outside of school but I only get to see some on the weekend sometimes. Mum doesn't let me go out of my suburb to see them though that often and most of the time I just have to stay home and talk to them over the phone or text or something. I'm a really introverted person except around my close friends where I really thrive. Around them is the only times I actually feel happy and feel like living. But I only get to feel that way a few days in a month. Every other day is literal hell. I sit in the corner by myself at school listening to music and trudging through ATAR hell and I s pend lun ch breaks sitting in the corner of the common room buried in beanbags. And I just feel like crying all the time those days and I feel like it's just not worth living at all and I'm so empty and sad. I'm too scared to talk to professional counselors or even like those crisis support hotlines and even my own parents and siblings?? I only talk to that group of friends about how I'm feeling but they can't really help all that much apart from just talking to me where it does improve my mood a little. I find you a really good guy to just vent to as well and I'm sorry to force you to read my sad wall of text but yeah idk what to do and I'm just stuck...",

        "question": "So I'm going to tell you something. I have this problem that I experience sometimes where I don't want to do something like art. But all the people I look up to are artists and I want to be like them. So then I don't want to do it. But I try to pressure myself to do it and here's why. Im in high school and I don't want to go to college because school has depressed me and made me go insane and I feel like I have to prove to my parents that I have a special skill or something so that they'd be okay with me not going to college. Because I see you- and it looks to me that you've had your awesome music skills since you were like a kid (I know I could be wrong just correct me or something) and you seem to be pretty successful for not going to college. So then I think I have to do the same thing. And a whole bunch of other people I look up to have also developed their awesome passions at a young age and I feel like I have to do the same. So I'm stuck between this thing of wanting to do artistic stuff right now to help prepare me for the future (even though I don't want to do it at the moment) and doing the things that make me happy even though they're kind of pointless like reading books or playing video games or watching movies. But to be honest, my interests shift by the second. I play video games for a little bit, and then I want to write. So... I have plenty of interests really. They just shift throughout the moment. And here's what I'm thinking: I think I should do the stuff I want to do right now and be concious of what my wants are. And keep shuffling around them accordingly to suit what I want at the moment and just kind of look at my wants and see what happens over time. But be concious of how I'm feeling. Sometimes I think I'll want to do art stuff but other times, I won't want to. But the reason why I'm doing this is to help myself just be myself in the best way. Sometimes I'll do stuff I don't want to do and force myself to do it. So I want to keep myself in check. And ask myself, \"do I really want to do this right now?\" and act accordingly instead of just kind of neglecting what I actually do want. And over the course of this I'll get to know myself better while freely being myself. For whatever reason, I think this'll be fun. Sorry if this was a bit confusing. I'm just trying to organize myself a bit and typing to you helps me get better at this stuff for some reason. So I'll see you man. I think I'll let you know how it goes.",
        "answer": "it took a long time. i turned down most of the normal routes and insisted on doing everything from the inside out, in my own way, while also getting deeply lost in the jungle on purpose to do it the way i did it you might want to get a very humble yet steady job that seemingly has nothing to do with your prefered 'field'. this is so as to not distract you from inventing it, and also buy you some time to really get it right yes yes good that sounds ferociously fun"

        "question": "i have a question. i think you said you are concocting your next song to work without bass, or that you were recording bass last in order to make sure it is still strong without bass. something to that effect. does that mean bass was central to your other recordings? cause i listen to a lot of your songs thru my phone speakers and they still sound good to me, i dunno if my question makes sense. i'm just wondering how you would make sure it sounds strong without the bass, because i feel like everything you make is already strong without bass",
        "answer": "not necessarily but it's gotta be a big deal i've presumably snuck by just by the seat of my pants. they're not written for bass, or as bass songs, they're just written as song songs, but a bass player secretly knows that any song is actually the best place for the bass to have a hot ball it's something i've been too scared to think about. but when i saw all my stuff doing so well on vine, i just sort of blindly and superstitiously accepted the fact that a large percentage of the audience was bassless and i was scared to think about it. for example many of those like \"stronger videos\" is going crazy on bass, but fortunately it gets by ok, again i'm sure this is largely because nothing was written with the bass in mind. all the bass fun is like 'bass player' fun (not writer) in that it's all after the song has been written, and those bass elements come from the player not the writer. song was already written before if that makes sense. like i said it was scary doing it blind but one day i just decided if this is actually where the music is being heard i need to actually hear it at some point. so i made an EQ setting to match the sound of a tiny bassless speaker and i can click it on any time, i call it the iphone simulator. and i recommend everyone should check this frequently especially at the very very beginning of your arrangement, what the hell even leave it on for long periods of time, especially at the beginning of the process. like making a compelling 3d drawing which has to look good in 3d but half your audience will only see it in 2d so it has to look great in 2d too. you're better off starting in 2d, because if you start in 3d it will be too easy to make it 3d because anything looks 3d automatically, and then when you flip it to 2d it could be garbage. where as if you start in 2d, you'll be forced to figure out how to make it look 3d even on the 2d system. if you do that you'll be way ahead of the game. then flip it to 3d and then add all the extra crazy things in 3d which won't mess up the 2d"

        "question": "when i try to organize what i mean to say in a structured, presentable way, i just end up cutting out the meaning. it's hard to tell what the core of importance is when trying to shuffle everything around until it reads like something that 'makes sense'. or maybe it's that when i feel the pressure to do this, i didn't get a chance to decide what i mean, it was imposed on me either by some Authority or my own self thinking it's absolutely necessary. then it's a fight to figure out what makes sense, what makes sense to me, what's going to make sense to whoever's going to see it, and that's hard to tease out especially with a real or even imagined deadline. i get caught up in teasing it up all nice, and it might carry some of the right meaning, but it's severely watered down or the real big points are underdeveloped in favor of presentability. and it's not exactly that i'm consciously trying to make it fake. it's endlessly second-guessing what's strong and what's not when i can delete and rephrase as much as i want. the reason rambling beginning-to-end with no edits works is because it's just everything that goes through my head, which is as real and close to my thoughts as anything...becuase... you know, they're my thoughts. how did that not occur to me? i can't believe myself. well. at least i know now. rumor has it that i'm a rotten person and everyone knows it. hmm. that's quite a jump. well it's not if you show the thread of thought that connected those things. which i forgot to do because i was busy thinking. or i was thinking about that before. or the parts that would make that make sense somehow fell through the filter. i don't know. i don't know i don't know asdfasdf dfjkdfjkdjfkdfj there's been no editing of this. it's beginning to end. it's not . that. bad. i.dont.know.anymore. why? do i focus. fucking focus fucking focus. what is your point? what is the point? what are you feeling? are you just stuck on the words that you're typing? is that taking over your mind in favor of what you're trying to actually get across? and why do you have to do it here? why? do you ? do this? i don't like that i do this. why not? because i do it wrong a lot. & nbsp;&nb sp; what's wrong? being fucking embarrassingly awful and terrible and maybe even gross. okay. you do it right sometimes? yes. i guess. okay. what is the difference between a time you did it 'right' and a time you did it 'wrong'? i forgot to have a point. i just talked to talked. i had feelings, sure, but being caught up in OMFG THIS HAS TO GET DONE AND IT HAS TO GET DONE RIGHT ruins it. you know what a big part of this is? this is how they teach you to write in school, conveying information in the standard, structured way. it can work if you're trying to convey plain information, and maybe you can learn to do it up all nice so it's not Boring As Fuck, but when you're writing what's on your mind the points are what's on your mind. and editing what's on your mind is editing out the actual meaning of those thoughts and feelings. how did that not occur to me? okay. i think i'm getting somewhere. i think. but what else? you forgot the part where you felt hurt. i felt hurt because i made and continue to make people uncomfortable when i be myself and i try to be better but i can't figure out how to BE because i am not a good be-er in the first place which makes it hard to figure out how to adjust your be-settings. what is be? well be is me. i guess. and what don't you like about you? that i'm so self-absorbed that it blinds me from seeing when i'm being ridiculous and broadcasting my ridiculousness and it's not that i'm all bad but i'm pretty bad why do you have to be so mean to yourself? because that's what i was taught to do. i guess. if you could forgive yourself, do you think you could find the strength to be as good as you can be and improve? i just don't understand. i don't know anymore. this is supposed to be fun. it's been fun but lately i've forgotten about having fun. for the most part i did a long time ago. this is as close as i get to that. and i just don't want to let go of it. because then i'll have nothing. and i did have nothing for a while. why. why why why why why why. why. why. why. why. why. why. why. why. why. bother. why. bother. why do you have to bother people. but i have to try a little harder than this, right? how do i be clear without being fucking bonkers? there's a lot of circumstances where that's not going to work. okay, here's my point :: i am sorry for any discomfort that i may have caused. i'm trying to try in the right way but i'm not exactly good at that. i want people to feel better for having interacted with me. i'm not good at that. i'm trying to learn how to do that. i guess that's it. i guess, outside of having fun. i'm trying to figure out how to be a human. this is probably far from the best way of doing that, but if it wasn't already clear, i am a severely confused person who just doesn't understand that sort of thing. but i desperately want to know how to not suck",
        "answer": "yes that's normal i have not heard that rumor this is to make sure you don't get too good. otherwise you may start your own awesome school and steal all their customers that's true evidence? it's important to realize that the reason you put so much pressure on yourself is because it means very very much to you to be the absolute best best thing possible. you have high standards because you are the leading authority on best-ness. at least that's the way it appears from the way you are approaching this they might like it seems like you already have the try dial just about set to max if you want to be clear, simplicity is always your friend. another great strategy to try when writing something for an audience if you are trying to make sure it is 'perceived' well: run-thrus. run through/read through the product in real time, after clearing your mind totally. so clear your mind totally (this works best if you do your read-throughs after doing something completely different for a while but not everyone has that kind of time) my trick that i use is i walk over and touch the door handle and return to the desk and do a timed run-through. this is the most clear way of seeing exactly how it is going to play out from the audience's perspective then after the run through you can try to recall vividly exactly which parts got you most excited and which parts didn't. and, what to do next. you will see this most clearly during the run through or in the 5 seconds after. capture your notes very quickly, and try to ascertain all that you felt about the run through. then make the necessary changes, if any, and get ready to do another run-through. sometimes you will take some notes but you are still not sure what to change, then the moment of clarity fades. that's ok. re-set and do another run through you might want to make your own personalized custom way. that's how some of the pros do it one of the best things about 'humans' is how damn different and unique each one of them can be. it sounds like your best bet here is to make up your own way. you seem to have exactly the drive and focus needed to do that i think you already figured that out a while ago"

        "answer": "yes off the top of my head, first i think of \"thrift shop\", that macklemore hit which was in G# min. Also i believe ed sheeran had a big hit within the last few years in G# min. what was it called ..... oh that's right \"sing.\" there was a big dance hit within the past decade called \"sweet sweet nothing\" which i think was in G#min or you could consider it B depending on how you orient it. there was a huge instrumental techno/dance hit from the 90s i think, \"do you think you're better off alone\", which i believe is G#min. I'm a survivor by destiny's child was in G#min. speaking of 2000ish 'bye bye bye' is G#min. \"Timber\" by kesha/pitbull was G#min. there are many more that's just what i can think of off the top of my head. oh yeah \"tina turner\" what's love got to do with it, that's G#min. also \"family affair\" mary j. blige is G#min. As for Eb min (D# min) let's see, there was one a few years ago called i \"won't black out\" i forget who it's by... just looked it up that's by breathe carolina. was a big hit around 2009. That rihanna one with chains/whips ..... s&m? that's Eb min for sure. speaking of which, rude boy was also Eb min (also rihanna.) A very popular ballad from around 2002 \"my whole life has changed...\" by ginuwine? that was in Ebmin. Stevie wonder \"i wish\" and \"superstition\" are hugely popular standards, both in Ebmin although many bands play them in E to make it easier for guitars and harder for the singer. Low by flo rida was Eb min. Ain't Nobody by chaka kahn is Ebmin. there are many many more but i'm trying to just stick to the popular ones because that's what you mentioned"

        "question": "Today I found myself watching YouTube videos all day, afraid to do anything besides that. I do have feelings of discomfort like that- which makes it hard for me to do activities that seem a bit scary to me even though it's all in my head. But today was the first time I had actually stooped so low in a very very long time. I was procrastinating on these two simple tasks I told myself to fulfill. Prior to playing my keyboard, I wanted to inspect my approach to music and perhaps change it. And I wanted to draw something original because I find that so scary. Both tasks were scary to me- playing the keyboard and drawing something original. The reason why playing the keyboard to me is scary is because my mind numbs to it and I find it harder to innovate. This makes me feel bad because it makes me feel like an insecure failiure. Drawing something original scares me because I'm the past I've found it to be quite a stress enduring task because I judge my wor k so har shly, I find it difficult to lift myself off the ground and persue an idea because I want it to be so perfect so bad. So both tasks are pretty stress enducing and my procrastination and fear got the best of me. It makes me feel sad. But... procrastinating felt so good that I'm confused to this whole situation. I came to the conclusion this morning that my approach to art was causing unnecessary stress and if I change my approach, art is bound to be more fun for me. But I pussied out! Because I was back in my stupid house that I hate being in and I found it to be so overwhelming I didn't even dare to try. Dammit I'm fucking retarded. ...why is it so hard for me to do this? It honestly upsets me. Oh my god I'm so sorry! I'm apologizing to you and me. Fuck- I could've been out there doing something amazing and getting over these fears but fuck no! All I thought about were those crippling feelings I got out of my past attempts. Ohhhh this is the first time in the past couple day s that I 've actually been this upset. Fuck you tat! Fuck fuck fuck fuck you for being so scared and fuck you for being so unable to change you fucking retarded bitch! Why can't I fucking change myself to actually be the person I dream of??? AAUUGHHHHHHHHHH IM MAD IM MAD IM MAD but you want to hear something? My mind doesn't feel overworked or upset at my dumbass!!! I feel like a piece of shit. You know what? I'm done. Fuck it. I'm going to that damn room and I'm going to create something beautiful. I'm done with this fucking bullshit of sabatoging myself. My punishment for not persuing my fears is to make myself uncomfortable facing my fears. I find that thought quite hillarious for some reason. Anyways I'll be back. Im about to fucking whip my ass and I forgot what other bullshit I was going to say I'm so mad right now BYE",
        "answer": "if there is a particular thing you want to accomplish, this is one weird trick i've learned, do it at the very beginning of the day after a very short walk. wake up, very short walk and visualize what you think you intend to do with the day and immediately do it. if you take control of the first hour of the day, the rest of the day falls into your pocket. it's the weirdest thing"

        "answer": "a big part of this is whether your keyboard knows the difference between when you smash hard and when you smash soft. phones don't have this, so if you just get even a very small midi controller keyboard, and hook it to your phone and use that. the loud/soft note thing is a big deal. if you don't have that you're gonna have a bad time the only thing you should be spending money on is a keyboard that knows the difference between a hard and soft note. all keyboards do except toy ones and even some of the toy ones can do it i think if you get yourself a keyboard that can tell the diff between a hard and a soft note that will put you way ahead of the game. for example, even if you never learn what note is what you can still make great rhythmic things happen on 1 note. but if your keyboard doesn't have loud/soft then you're gonna have a bad time"

        "answer": "i usually only change the key for the voc. for range issues. for example i was writing \"outside\" in D but then i came up with a bridge that wanted to go way down low so i moved the entire song to starting E to be more reasonable. regardless i always do key check before starting the recording, and often nudge it up a few for vocal brightness, because writing voice can be mumbly and low. key choice is all based on the vocal, but also let's be real also try to avoid the exact same key of the last song i just released"

        "answer": "i used to write the chart on staff paper but i no longer use any paper. i use a text file and audio recordings. the lyrics are written in the text, and next to each line (maybe every 2 lines or every 4 lines) there is the file name of the audio reference. when the song is done you might often see a file name at the top of the page for a full run thru. then often when starting the arrangement, i will whip up a \"studio chart\" (really just chords) based on the run-thru, and put it on paper just to have something on the stand to look at in the empty beginning stages of the arrangement. but pretty soon as things get filled in i wouldn't need it anymore because it's all in there. and then when doing vocals i may type up a lyric cheat sheet. sometimes i may reference the demo run-thru if i want to confirm what the exact melody was"

I feel like I've gotten more used to playing there that I can go to the moon and back easier than in other keys.

        "answer": "there's a weird and cool technique you can do. actually there's 2. one is keep your head pointing straight forward. sometimes you think you want to sing the note up. you don't need to do that. sing it straight across even if it's high. but the other really crazy trick, this is a psychological trick, pretend you are singing down to the note. pretend it's not the highest note you can sing. pretend it's a low note and sing down to the note. like pretend you can sing way higher and sing down to it. here's another trick, this one comes from tony robbins, just close your eyes and imagine yourself singing the note clearly and beautifully. just visualize it happening, 10 times in a row. now try it. these are all interesting tricks. but don't forget to warm up before doing high notes and don't push hard, and if it hurts don't do it"

        "question": "No such thing as an objective truth--- or at least there is as much objectivity in our universe as there is subjectivity--- Our realities are bounded by our sensory abilities and as everything in the universe is defined by the laws of cause and effect, we can assume that for all things and non-things (and things in-between things and non-things), a set path of event-to-events is in place as far as our perception of reality allows. I.e. if the exact circumstances that caused the creation of our universe were to reoccur in the exact same way, then every following time-related outcome would be identical. Every life, death, thought, personality, choice, etc. is predetermined, like an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine with a few of the components trying to rationalize their place in the whole thing. At the end I'm betting on nothingness, but hoping for something cooler. Like a controlled rewind button with godmode or to wake up in the fourt h dimens ion having finished this low budget 3-d rpg.

        "question": "I want to get into music production but I have very little knowledge of it. I know some music theory but I know next to nothing about actual production like how to mix, EQ etc. I thought it would be a good idea to learn from the masters and try to recreate instrumentals of your songs and get it to sound as close to the original as possible. I'm hoping that way I learn from practical experience and find out things along the way. Do you think that's a good approach to learning music production? How did you get started and what approach would you recommend?",
        "answer": "i think that might be a confusing and difficult task. and i think a soundalike would much more heavily rely on matching the arrangement than the eq Just do what's necessary. record something using just 2 instruments, see how it goes. see how it sounds. the first thing you will learn is simply how to set the volumes of each instrument in comparison to each other. sounds dumb but it's very important and you must start there. do things in the order that you hear a need"

        "question": "could you describe your mastering process? which things (compression, multipression, eq automation, limiting) do you do, in what order? are there any examples of you using an effect on the stereo out track? one time i did a reverb freeze going into the bridge and man that was powerful. any nifty tips on efficiency or making it sound so damn freakin crisp and wonderful? thanks",
        "answer": "listen to to the track and then listen to a professional modern pop song and then contemplate suicide for a while and then pick myself up and then try to fix some things, i guess i'm still figuring out the system, i got a lot more detailed on the last 3 songs (except the most recent one) and then suddenly i decided to start doing them in 1/4 of the amount of time, so a lot of that has gone out the window, which is good because it makes you gravitate toward the most important things. not usually but that could be useful i recently learned to group things to aux's. i should have learned that much sooner but i learned it recently. it's very good for doing reverb, and automating reverb. automating reverb opens a whole new door to fun times one weird weird thing i noticed, i was mixing hallelujah for way way too long and feeling trapped and down about it, listening to 'new rules' side-by-side with it and just wanting to die over it, (by the way this was just days before i found out the loudness war is officially over. so now we don't have to worry about that which is huge huge news, but this was right before i realized that) anyway, i had done all this work on the mix for hallelujah, and it's also just a really dense and layered textural arrangement, etc, and whatever, and then i was poking around for reference songs (such as new rules and several other songs done by other people) and was generally freaking out about how much clearer everyone else's songs sounded but (i'm getting to the point of this, hold on) here's the surprise: i accidentally opened up one of my jazz jam sessions (like anything you would hear on the 'jazz' section of this site) and i was shocked to find out that that recording sounded so much more clear, sounded like it was mixed much much better, but as we all know it is not even mixed at all. those are instrumental jams where i lay down each instrument in 1 crazy take, bounce it out and call it a day. and the point is, i found out that that mix (which was no mix) had a lot more punch and clarity than this hallelujah mix which i had so tenderly spent so many long days on. the lesson was , ...... if you use a million instruments it is a real challenge to mix it out of sounding like mud. even if it's very tenderly layered and arranged instruments, the point is, if there are many instruments, they will clog up the mid range, like that troublesome 100-300 range. but if you use only 3 or 4 instruments, ..... it's just got automatic clarity. so that's something. so this works to my advantage now working under these crazy deadline schedules, because i simply don't have time to make as dense an arrangement, and it is therefore easier to mix. Another thing i learned, on the subject of working faster, is, ... work faster. you gravitate toward what matters. and it is so easy to lose your mind if you listen to that damn thing for too long. you'll just lose your mind ...... another way to get tips is watching a billion mixing tutorials and tips videos until you realize they are all starting to contradict each other, and then you forget it and do what you want"

Now, this wouldn't be so weird, if I myself wasn't a vocalist. How can I spend so much time around vocal music, and yet not be able to write any myself? What the hell is wrong with me?",
        "answer": "what might be helpful is to get the writing done outside of the program. just get some paper or text, and your favorite playable instrument. write what you want to write, then once you know fully how it goes then go into the program and start putting it together according to the road map. if this still doesn't work then i recommend spending some quality time with the words alone. open a text file or blank piece of paper and go bananas for a few months"

        "answer": "yes you do, if this is who i think it is, you're the one who's been stalking me for several months now and I don't know you, but based on what you've said over the years, I'm guessing people (family?) forced \"help\" on you when you were younger to try to get you to conform to some shit ideal they had for who they wanted you to be. I'm very sorry that happened. That's not fucking okay. Sure, you're eccentric and unique and innovative and genius and \"weird\"... and as long as you're happy and you're not hurting anyone, you should be able to do and be and live whatever and however the fuck you want. Always. Period. I will fight til the death for your right to be as free and insane as makes you happy. But your needs and experiences aren't everyone's needs and experiences. Some people need therapy and meds to achieve basic functioning and baseline peace or to tak e care o f their kids or to take care of themselves or whatever the fuck it is that they need to do in this life... and I am clearly one of them. And when you think you're just hating on quack doctors, you're also shitting on the good ones who save lives and help give people skills that transform their lives for the better. And you're making people feel bad for not being as \"strong\" or as \"free\" as your online persona proports to be. It should come as no surprise to you that I quit taking my meds when I first started following you early this year because I thought \"if he doesn't need them, then I don't either!\"... and how did that turn out? Pretty fucking badly, I guess... right? So maybe just chill the fuck out for a minute and stop trying to convince everyone to get off their meds unless you're actively trying to get people to become creepy obsessive unhinged lovesick psychos when their brain chemistry jumps off the deep end. https://www.reddit.com/r/billwurtz/comments/9h5zc7/whoa/ what i meant to say was, the term \"ADHD\" seems pretty offensive to me, because i think the D stands for disorder, and i get very sad when i hear about how common it is for school kids to be told something is wrong with them just for being disinterested in uninteresting material. that would be kind of like making a movie and then telling the audience there's something wrong with them if they were bored by it ..... but i saw quite a bit of back lash for the thing i said, which i didn't even explain clearly, what you're saying is not what i said nor meant, and i felt terrible and so i've concluded that the whole thing is definitely none of my business"

        "question": "As far as I can recall, none of your songs have had a fading outro vamp before \"Mount St. Helens is about to Blow Up\". Was this just a particular stylistic choice for this song, or was it done in the interest of saving time due to your extremely tight production schedule?",
        "answer": "we could just get high does it was a natural chain reaction from the 'special' line actually the opposite. it had a devastating effect on the time. was ready to wrap it up at 2 minutes with a tiny last verse, but then it hits the 'special' line which sends it tumbling into a perpetual outvamp which never wants to end. then i check the time at the end and it's 3min15, and it's sunday. i was 3 days behind compared to last time (due to business trip) and now as an extra surprise the song just spontaneously wrote itself over 3 minutes when i thought i was gonna get out at 2. the previous song was 2:21 and it was nearly impossible in 14 days. now i gotta do 3:15 in 9? 'ok sure what' is what i believe i said to myself"

        "question": "hey so you were wondering if the gift shop of mt. st. helens is still \"there\" but I'm curious if you thought the chord on \"there\" was too regular as just a little 2 5, since the picture being painted is kind of distant and longing, where as the chord is very straightforward feeling. Though at the same time i understand your choice within the context of the piece and the time limit. curious if you have any tidbits",
        "answer": "not exactly normal, it slips into a strange key the first way it came to me was as it is. when i went to work out the details, i refined it to actually be F over Bb (on \"there\") was more shiny and exotic that way, and seemed cool because that would actually make it nearly exactly how it happened on \"grey\" at the same time in the first verse except a half step higher. so i thought that would be the right answer, but then upon run-through in wider context it instantly felt wrong, and it was immediately clear that the way i first had it was better so i switched it back. sometimes what seems to work up close just doesn't work in the real time flow of the song in wider context. that's why full run throughs (like from the beginning) are so important, and the only way to find out what's really gonna work"

        "question": "Hey Bill, I've been reading through the past week or so of questions and answers and I have noticed a trend in how you answer questions, and I assume it is completely intentional and an extension of the persona that you display in your songs, which in itself is cool and honestly pretty damn endearing due to the sideways and sometimes really succinct and brief ways you answer most complex questions/comments that I or most other people would elaborate upon. My guess for why you rarely elaborate on any answer you give (especially in regards to questions about you or your music) is because you either want people to figure it out for themselves or its just personal and (I assume) you don't want to divulge that information about yourself, both of which are respectable and genuine reasons. However as someone who just wants to know whats going on inside that brilliant brain of yours, it drives me absolutely insane! You so very clearly have ideas you want to convey a nd messages you want to communicate with everyone, and about 80% of these questions have genuine answers about motivation, attitude and inspiration, all of which are actually GREAT advice! If possible could you give an explanation of a lot of the motivation behind your songs? or at least in some way tell us a message or central idea you want your audience to take away from your music. And don't worry, i'm not expecting a direct answer, both because you're not a very direct person in your responses most of the time, and more so because all great teachers of philosophy and introspective thought never just tell people what they are trying to get them to understand. I really really want a full response so I can understand your thought process. To be more clear, i'm not asking for a \"moral of the story\" message or anything like that, I'm asking more if there is a method of thought that you live by that leaks through in your songs? Because you have a very unique way of making song s that a lways seems to have deep and intertwining themes. If possible can you walk us through your philosophical approach to the world around you and your attitude towards trials in life as well as your way of expressing this through your music? Don't worry, i'm already expecting on getting goofed on with a one word response, or getting a really backwards answer. I just figured that I might as well try and ask all this stuff. Because after all, where is the harm in asking.",
        "answer": "that is to distract you from all the hundreds of other times i have answered those same questions in excrutiatingly elaborate detail i've discovered that songs can unlock some of the deepest powers of the universe the world has infinite power and it's on your side ah, that's true. i think showing can be more effective than telling. even better than showing is if you can get them to actually do it ... or, for a twist, realize they already have done it that could take a lifetime but i am doing it anyway"

The way you do it is such a fresh and genius approach. Even though your lyrics are on the absurd side, maybe even BECAUSE they are on the absurd side, nobody will relate to it literally so everybody can relate to it emotionally. Instead of the music enhancing the lyrics, they work together to enhance the feeling. That's the effect your music has on me at least. Is that what you are going for?",

        "answer": "well this might not be the only way, but i'll give you an example. in 2007 i wrote a journal entry (or freestyle ramble thing) which sucked. i did this every day but they didn't always suck. but on a particular day in 2007, i made one that really sucked. fast forward to 2015, i'm writing for vine, because i just tricked myself into having to do 7 videos a week, so i needed material. so i started playing a game where i randomly select a day from the past and then check to see what i was doing or saying/writing about on that particular day, and try to write a short vine-able jingle video which matches the way my life is going at that point. i found an entry from 2003 or something that said 'can your life withstand the pressure of the pen' or something, and i thought about it a little and came up with the \"Are you the Real You?\" jingle. another randomly selected day put me at jan 20, 2011, where i had been fervently studying the emotional implications of different chord sequences, song forms, etc. really was on an obsessive scientific rampage trying to really figure out what is making music tick. so based on this (in this 2015 writing session) i wrote \"i'm gonna figure out what everything means.\" then i did the random selection again and it came up to something from 2007 that was just a page of writing which seemed to have absolutely no creative value, no informational value, no entertainment value, no biographical value, absolutely no value on the page. just a terrible terrible page. so naturally the jingle idea that comes to mind goes like this. ok, next pick. so i do the random date selection again, and the next one that comes up is actually the very next page from the crappy 2007 one i just did. it's the next day. out of thousands of days that could have been picked, the exact next day came up. and it sucked just as much. it was terrible. i think i was at a really useless/hopeless place at that time, which is unusual for me, but that's just the way i was feeling during that time, i assume. another totally garbage page, very similar to the previous. so now i'm thinking (on this 2015 writing session) i'm feeling totally screwed, because i feel like i just did this one. which leads to the only obvious solution which would be this. i think i had a point in here somewhere"

        "question": "how do i know which key i should be singing? usually i just hit that TRANSPOSE button up or down and find out which transposition sounds better.",
        "answer": "try them all. it will be a different key for each song look at what number it says, and add or subtract from the key your playing in. so if you are physically playing the keys like it's in C, but the transpose says +4, that means it is actually sounding in the key of E"

        "question": "Do chromatic chords have functions like diatonic chords do? I guess I would say the bII chord has a dominant function because it's a common substitute for the V chord and it naturally gravitates toward the I chord. Also the bVI is probably a subdominant because it gravitates toward the V chord. But the other chromatic chords aren't as obvious to me. The concept of function helps me decide which chords to use when so I wonder if you can think about non-diatonic chords functionally. Do you think about them functionally? How do you know which chromatic chord is appropriate when?",
        "answer": "what exactly is a chromatic chord USE YOUR EARS, MIND, AND GENERAL SELF!!! the golden rule is, try it, and listen to the whole song and see if it makes it better or worse. this is a classic trick"

        "question": "9.26.18 9:14 am yeah, i actually totally understand what you're saying. That actually makes me feel a lot better about things. Thank you. Now, here's another thing, do you ever feel like something you're trying to do gets \"lost in translation/adaption\"? Example: I have this amazing short story. One of the best things I've written thus far. There's this playwright competition thing I'm doing for school (two actually). I had this great idea: \"Hey, I'm going to turn that short story of mine into a stage play\" So, I start writing. And ew. In my head the idea worked so well, but on paper it's just not good. It loses all the stuff that made the original so fucking good. It made me kinda resent the story and avoid working on the script but the deadline is rearing it's godawful head and I'm going to have to finish it even though i don't like it and it just isn't what I wish it was. Oh, another thing I hate ab out it. I'm expected to write a good play but they (the judges i guess) put so many restrictions on it.",

        "question": "Hi Bill, So I just started teaching myself how to play piano with a book i got from a store, Which is also teaching me how to read sheet music at the same time. My problem is that I am so new to both concepts that it takes me an incredibly long time just to figure out the notes let alone being able to play the notes as i read them. Then once i figure out the notes from the sheet music it falls under muscle memory and i end up getting technically better with playing the piano but not so great at reading while playing. Should I focus on one more than the other to start or should i keep trying to play as I'm reading?",
        "answer": "i could recommend 2 things. simpler reading exercises, and also some time spent with the instrument and no reading. just see what that bad boy can do"

        "answer": "pitch bend, and the other one. most keyboards have those 2 wheels. the pitch bend wheel is spring loaded and usually gives you a whole step either way (or you can set it different if u want) and the other wheel is not spring loaded, and does different things depending on the instrument but on many instruments it's vibrato. i mostly use it for vibrato, on that particular sound i have it for vibrato. but on many sounds i use it for filter cutoff (\"wawa\"). very useful, especially in getting your digital instrument to sound a bit more like something 'real'"

If you wanna learn that stuff, task yourself with making an entire presentation of your own, in your wildest specifications, not under anyone's direction, where you are supposed to explain all that stuff. then you'll have to just go out and learn what you need somehow. you'll learn it very very well that way. but if you wanna pass someone else's test then i wouldn't know what to tell you ...maybe find their answer key?"

        "answer": "that actually shouldn't be true. i thought it was normalized on youtube. if what you're saying is true then it means the loudness war is not over you can get it loud enough but it will sound very strange unless you are very careful"

I don't listen to country music and I'm not even from the US but this song just has this certain homeyness to it. People from all sorts of countries have said the same. How does it do it? There must be something \"universal\" that the song is doing for people all around the world to feel so homey. All of that despite this sort of country music being arguably distinctly North American. What do you think that is? Is it the slow tempo? The relatively simple harmony? Or is it the fact that country music is generally associated with peaceful landscapes, nature, a simple and happy lifestyle and stuff like that? Because there are a lot of songs that have that but don't make me feel the way this song does. I really can't put my finger on it and I'd appreciate your thoughts on it.",
        "answer": "it is an average tempo, which could also be considered double or half depending on how you choose to write it down it is reasonably ordinary harmony they did a good job. if you do a good enough job in music you get a free pass across cultural boundaries. that is the highest honour (first prize)"

        "question": "Is pop a genre or is it just a way to categorize the popular songs of the time. Because I feel like the pop genre specifically is one that has really changed over time. Like if you look at songs from the late 2000s early 2010s and compare them to songs from today it's really a surprise to find out that they're the same genre because they're really quite different. Then if you go further back to the 80s for example you see that they're really different from today's music. Now that I think about it this is the same as with other genres as well. So with that being said do genres even exist? If I'm listening to \"closer\" and I want more songs like that and I put on a pop playlist I'm gonna be really surprised when something like \"wake me up before you go go\" comes on because they're so different. So then shouldn't songs not be classified into just genres like pop and rock but rather genres AND their time period like 90s pop or 60s rock. Thoughts? ALSO I've been thinking about this - how do you actually write a songs in a certain genre? Like???? What???? What makes a pop song pop or a rock song rock or a metal song metal (I'm talking in terms of just melody lyrics and chords)? Is it just the production stage in which a song develops a genre? Like if I wrote a song and then made three different versions, one with synths and shit, one with some heavy guitar, and one with some sick beats, would I have one song in three different genres? Or just one song? And if I just have one song what genre is that?????? I'm going crazy. How do you think you make a song a certain genre?",
        "answer": "they may seem to exist only when the world is on pause classification systems are endless hours of fun, and yet they always fall apart. which is actually a blessing because you get to keep making more systems you will have to contact the authorities on that one it's your choice when you are filling out the registration form first you must ascertain exactly what the client wants. if they can't give you a reference song to go from, you'll have to be deft at reading between the lines ....."

        "answer": "the 2 most important things i've discovered recently is to get a small amount of physical exercise first when you wake up, then get to work. also day evaluations at end of day, and day plans at the beginning of the day. not insane amounts of detail in them. also, absolutely no checking email when you wake up. many people have a no phone in bed rule, i don't follow that because i need the notes app to do the end of day ev, and sometimes the day plan. but i absolutely have a no apps besides the notes app rule in bed. the general idea is that if you start the day with no distractions, that is the secret to acing the day. if you have distractions in the morning, the whole thing falls apart. that's just something i've learned. but everyone is different and maybe i didn't even used to be this way"

Murakami: People are always asking me about the books: \"What do you mean by this; what do you mean by that?\" But I cannot explain anything at all. I talk about myself, and I talk about the world, metaphorically, and you cannot explain or analyze metaphors - you just have to accept the form. A book is a metaphor.\" Do you relate to his answer? When people ask about the 'meaning' of your songs, is your thought process about the question similar to his?",

        "answer": "that's not true negotiating for more time never stops at just a couple days. once you open that door it's weeks more i've been doing that all year and it never worked until i signed a cold hard contract this is a training exercise to increase the quality in ways i never would have found otherwise that is somewhat true temporarily, but then very quickly teaches me a whole host of new lessons in how to reduce it, which in turn will lead me directly to the lessons on how to do this better and more effectively drastically increasing my rate of improvement, growth, and strength, in virtually every area of my life, in more ways than i ever would have expected we (the fans) get brand new content from you bi-weekly, which feels great, remembering that it used to take 8-10 weeks to get a single music video. but what about you bill? it's the biggest breakthrough i've had since the 5-day schedule in early 2014"

        "question": "Can you give me a short explanation of 7th chords and diminished/aug chords? i learned to use major/minor/flat/sharp chords while playing pop but jazzy stuff has some unfamiliar chords. im trying to play what you wont do for love right now and its got c#7#9 like what does that even mean",
        "answer": "the way that type of song uses the notation system is a bit oblique .... very normal but not a good starting point for learning chord symbols. i can tell you what chord goes there in that song, it's C# in the bass, and you're gonna want B, F, and E in the mid range. but it may not be clear how we get that from the C#7#9 chord symbol. to get the chord symbol thing a bit better, i think you should start in the key of C, and for your first example just play C major chord (the chord symbol for that is just C), and then add a Bb note to it. that is C7. that's just what that is. good starting place ...... when i was young, someone confided in me that C7 is the perfect way to signal you're about to go to the F chord. try it ... try a song in C, and play some things in the key of C and then drop that C7 and bam, the whole world knows it's time to go to F now. i think that's a good starting point ... that's where i started ... i'll never forget when i learned that. changed my life. i still use that principle in almost every song"

        "question": "Physical activity seems pretty important to how you get your mood, productivity, and discipline to where it needs to be to do some pretty phenomenal things. (The last series of pairs of weeks has again proved it. Thanks for putting your ideas in my head.) I want to learn how to do the same. I know in my heart and brain that moving my body will have the same effect, but I lack the discipline to even do the thing that I know will help. It has just never been a habit, and so I am less fit and I view it as an \"extra\" thing that is hard to do and wastes the time I already am not using well enough. Has running/moving always been a part of your life, or if you had to develop that habit, how do I get from zero but stay there once I start?",
        "answer": "try something a little easier and simpler than you may have been thinking of. .... also, this may sound basic, but just go on youtube and start watching success strategy videos, sucessful habbits videos, etc etc etc. and just realize that a lot of them are contradictory and not all of them make sense for everyone. but just watch a bunch of those videos and see which ones make you go 'yes, that sounds like me!' or 'no, that sounds like someone else' ..... i'm sure you will find things that work for you. it's best if it's only 1 or 2 things, to start out, to keep it reasonable"

        "answer": "that's one in particular you will probably never see. but here's the basic starting examples i can give for that: C7 means C, E, G, Bb.... Cmaj7 means C, E, G, B. ... Cmin7 means C, Eb, G, Bb.... there are some quirks here already with the system, but hopefully those examples expose them. Csus4 means C, F, G. and Csus2 means C, D, G... so 'sus' is just a little trick that swaps the 3 out for a 4 or 2. if it doesn't say 4 or 2 then it means 4. so if you see \"Csus\" on paper that's gonna mean Csus4."

I agree with the point that I think paul was making, that popular music isn't for whatever reason less valid or has less artist merit than the \"high class stuff\"... but was classical music actually popular in its time? Like didn't mozart and beethoven and all those guys mostly perform for royalty and stuff? And you had to be really rich to go see an orchestra or an opera or whatever, and there wasn't any recorded music or radio or anything.... Wouldn't popular music at that time have been the music people made themselves, like traditional folk songs and church hymns and stuff??",

I would really love music as a career but i'm on the fence, i have some doubts. I want to either make music as my career or computer science. My family and friends mostly support the computer science, because pay is better and there are more job opportunities but even though computer science is enjoyable, music is like enjoyable x100. Do i have to go to music school? I mean i have a lots of gaps in my knowledge and i need to fill that. Or i might somehow make two of the choices work at the same time. Did you go to music school? How's the pay for a musician new in the scene? I love playing to a crowd and seeing them enjoy my performance that's one of the many ways of music i love",

        "question": "This is interesting for me to know. Does having perfect pitch sometimes mess with your daily life. Like if you heard a noise like a generator or a car horn, you can't help your brain from figuring out the note of the sound. And you can't stand it when a song is sung in a different key than the original. I've heard some people say that.",
        "answer": "they are just showing off. those things would never be bothersome for any reason related to absolute pitch. in fact usually when i hear someone complain about an issue like that, they are faking anyway and they are wrong about the notes they are complaining about"

        "question": "Hey it's me again, felt like asking another very specific and long winded question about your mental state as it reflects the themes and ideas of you music. The new song \"long long long journey\" seems to me that it is split almost in half, or maybe thirds if you squint the right way, in regards to theme. The first part is incredibly somber and quite frankly depressing, exuding the feeling of exhaustion and trying to trick yourself into going forward (maybe this is just my personal experiences with depression and feeling desperate to keep moving, but the three lines about how far you've gone and then with the \" and it's a long long long long long way back\" to me feels more like a reminder that you can't change your mind now. Instead of being encouraging and motivating, to me it feels daunting and frightening that now you kind of have to keep going forward since you cant go back.) Regardless of the first bits, the second part se ems to t ake a more positive outlook, especially with the last line with the \"road\" being to success. My best guess is that this song is about struggling to stay either motivated with a project or with life in general, that or it could be about depression and a kind of subliminal encouragement to those suffering that it DOES get better if you keep fighting. Those are my two best guesses. What do you think I'm mighty wurtz?",

        "question": "Hey I need a little advice. My life has been feeling empty and directionless for a long time and I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. Then I discovered you and I just felt like wow that's exactly what I want to do. Be a musician, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist content creator etc etc. I'm not out of highschool yet and I'm very close to turning my life around but I don't know if it's stupid to pursue something only because of my adoration of you? I can't tell of it's following my dream or taking some obsession too far. Sorry for the long ueqstion",
        "answer": "you could try it until you get tired of it. for me, music hit me hard at an extremely extremely young age, then if it ever went away momentarily it would always come back and hit me harder from a different angle. various things have hit me like this at different times, but music has been deeply connected to most of them. what you see me doing today is sort of a natural merging of many many different things i have been deeply obsessed with for my entire life. so if it is not that for you, the worst thing that could happen is you may simply get tired of it. no harm in checking. one time i thought i was going to suddenly learn to trade foreign currencies and make a living off of it. i never thought about doing it before, and never had any experience doing it. i tried it and lost interest after about 2 weeks. but that doesn't mean i shouldn't have tried it"

        "question": "So a few weeks ago you were wondering if it was better to have the song available before or after the music video was uploaded, because due to all sorts of shenanigans from music provider, having both be released at the same time was impossible. Since the last song was also available before the video, does that mean you picked \"before\"? Follow-up question, do you know that the song video automatically generated by youtube is region locked such that we can only listen to your new song if it's passed midnight in our timezone? Would you be willing to release the song directly on your website at the same time as that song video is generated? That way we could all enjoy your new song at the same time regardless of local time, instead of having to do through silly lengths to bypass the region lock.",

Or maybe do the first one first and then gradually apply music theory to what I'm doing so I can analyze and understand what I'm doing, and thus do it better and more consistently in the future? Also, I'm considering getting an electric keyboard even though we have a really grand grand piano in our house because it would help me write/improv music without worrying about what my family members hearing it (I would use headphone plug-ins) because I've heard that professional musicians limit the part of their brain that worries about what other people think while they're improv-ing and until I'm brave enough to do that I think it would be nice to have a private environment to try this in. Thoughts?",
        "answer": "play, but i thought that was what music theory is anyway (playing) anyone can make a theory about music. it is fun and enjoyable until the music again and again will outrun and out wit each theory. which is scary at first but then also fun that's true"

        "question": "Hi Bill. So I've got a pretty good relative pitch. Once I know the note of one pitch, I can pretty much tell the rest because I have a reference. But I want to tell a pitch without a reference. Can you teach me how to do that? I know perfect pitch is not the most important thing in the world but I just want to know if it's possible to learn. I want to identify notes without reference.",
        "answer": "yes you can't get really hard wired for absolute pitch unless you do it before you are about 6 years old the good news is, it's not that hard to do, you just won't be as fast as those who are super hard wired AP. who knows, you may even catch some in a lie ...... but anyway, start by memorizing the key of every song you know, and every common beep and tone in your society. (microwaves, car horns, your electronic devices, etc. just get to know them all. you probably won't forget). based on your early childhood experience, you may find that you have at least one note absolutized in your memory. and you can learn to work with that quite easily, although 12 times slower than someone who had all 12 absolutized from childhood. i've actually never met anyone who has that, and i've never heard of anyone having that while also being really good and comfortable with everything musical / relativity has to offer. i trust that it's possible but haven't seen it yet. which is somewhat re-assuring to those of us who forgot to learn in any key other than C until age ........ 7"

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of the universe. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.\" ~Mariann e Williamson",

I've probably listened to your music more than any other artist in the past year or so.. but I'd like to see you selling out madison square garden and hearing your songs whenever I turn on the radio, etc. I think there's a lot of pop artists who actively try to make 'pop music'.. which isn't to say that pop can't still be unique or great or whatever, but I think there's more to writing pop than just making what you like.

        "question": "I feel Slow Down talks about that feeling of pressure when a deadline is coming. And not even a proper deadline, maybe some deadline you have inside your head, like \"i'm good enough, I should be able to finish this by tomorrow\". That sort of feeling. You should slow down and take of yourself, stop and think what you really feel and what you really want to do. Is this the case with the song? Towards the end I got the feeling of doing something because someone asked. In this case, writing a song about how that special someone is always there for you, in this case the \"special someone\" is the client, and we could easil interpret the client as the audience who pay to listen to music. Is this how you feel about the music business? I apologise for the amount of questions, I just feel you're really authentic but the lack of wanting to explicitly tell what you're feeling is keeping me from really understand where you're coming from. But the thing with music is that... that's alright. It's not always about understanding. Sometimes you just gotta think and deduct. And that is what I'm doing right now. So it's fun, in a certain way, and I hope you're having fun with this question. I just wish you the best because you've always kept yourself honest and fought throughout the uncomfortableness.

        "answer": "possibly it would have to be a completely different tempo than the rest of the song. it doesn't line up with anything. when i was recording other parts for the verse, after the pre-intro was done, i really had to turn the click on and completely ignore the pre-intro. i can tell you it does not line up properly unless you call it a tempo change on paper. actually there is a further complication because after it ends there's still 1 swung 16th note going into the next part, because the landing point is essentially the \"a\" of 4 so to speak"

Thats kinda odd, does this really happen to you? For example, you say this to another person: \"oh yeah this song is my favourite\", and then instantly another song becomes your favourite.

        "question": "Been listening to a lot of joni mitchell lately, and I've been really inspired by her guitar parts... particularly how she uses so many alternate tunings to get some cool fresh chord voicings.. I know you're not really a guiarist, but my question is, do you think that there's any way to figure out what tuning is being used just by listening to a song? I was thinking that the tonic chord provides a big clue. You wouldnt tune to open D, but then play in the key of G# or something (if you're in open D, your 1chord will probably be D). But once you throw in capos to the mix the tonic chord clue isn't very helpful (you can tune to open D, but then put your capo on the 2nd fret to play in E, etc)... Also, side question, how does using a lot of different tunings work live? Like were 50% of joni mitchell concerts just her tuning her guitar a million times?",
        "answer": "it's kind of like a murder mystery. you just gotta study the clues and you might figure it out, or you might not in which case the murderer will go free multiple guitars. depending on your income bracket you may even have a person hand them to you and take away the previous one"

I dare you to record a song that doesn't use the major one as the first chord of the A or B section. I don't think you've done that since \"what's going on\". Just an idea..love your songs, just a friendly dare..a minor song with like a hip-hoppy beat would be amazing from you I think. But don't worry, I'm just a creatively stifled dude who is bitter because I don't have the guts or focus to put myself out there or work hard on my own music, so I critique other people's music to feel better about myself. Hope you have a great day and happy songwriting!!",
        "answer": "minor songs always seem like a good idea in thought but then when it comes time for the magic, they have a habit of swapping themself out. for example, 'outside' verse (just picked up the newspaper) originally came to me with the first chord as it's relative minor. same melody but the first chord as it's rel. minor. that was how it went (so then it would have been C#-7, F#-7, B7sus4) but then as i familiarized myself with the figure and started writing more lines, they automatically felt better starting from the rel 1 (E). speaking of outside, the chorus starts on 5 (and also the intro). it seems like a nice idea, in theory, to be sad sometimes, but in reality there is never a great time to do it long journey chorus starts on 4. every bridge or B section of every song starts on non-1 i almost never use the 1 chord to start the B sec"

        "question": "Why does \"slow down\" seem louder than your other songs? Also, sometimes it feels like the vocals aren't really clear, and are being covered up by the other instruments. Or the lyrics just don't feel heavy enough, there's a lot of breath and air. So it sounds unbalanced some of the times I listen to it.",
        "answer": "perhaps because i was informed the loudness war was over a few months ago but then someone recently told me it is not entirely, and they said my songs seem to be quieter than everyone else's. so i was sure to give an extra push. someone also said the highs were too weak, which i figured was true. someone also said the bass was weak, so i tried to run the bass a little louder. someone also said the bass was still weak after i did that. sometimes i find it easier to quickly compensate for an unclear instrumental mix by simply bringing the vocals louder. but that's not entirely fair because that makes the groove weaker. so with this one i may have kept the insts stronger. also i think i was still aware that the highs were still not strong enough so i likely boosted the highs. also, too much mids are also always a problem so i almost always tuck the heck out of that otherwise it is just extremely volatile all the time unless i spend years micro managing it. which i assume no one has time to do. would you like to mix my songs for me, i'm looking for someone who has the level of professional experience needed to really do it properly, on a professional time schedule, and it sounds like you might be that person. can you give me some examples of tracks you have mixed"

        "answer": "with a band it wouldn't be that way at all live. it would hopefully be much better and more well rounded in sound. any song can be done any way, that's one of the most fun things about songs. and i exploit this to the fullest by never doubting that i can do any song all by myself, using only the tools i have. despite the fact that it usually sounds drastically different than i may have imagined it. a great majority of my songs would probably be much better as guitar songs of some sort. but that's just not what i can do nor have. when the live band show comes around, it will open up many many different doors so that a lot of the shenanigans i do on records will not be necessary anymore... this is why it seems strange to me when i hear people cover my songs and they cover every little riff in between lyrics excactly the way my recording did. to me that wasn't even part of the song, that's just the best way i could think of to deliver the song at that time using the only tools i have available. for example i bend over backwards doing all kinds of things to make up for the fact that i can never really have a strumming guitar. a strumming guitar of some sort is what every song probably really needs. and yet because i don't have that i usually end up doing completely different and unrelated things, to compensate. which i think has worked surprisingly well unless you ask the haters and hatresses"

        "question": "Can you give me any tips on how to hear and distinguish a fully diminished chord from a half diminished chord? Do you instantly know what it is or do you have to actively concentrate to the 7th? Also, why is it so difficult for me to distinguish a diminished triad from an augmented triad? It really shouldn't be, they're way too different and yet I have a hard time doing it. I can tell the difference between these chords if I try really hard to isolate pitches but I want to be able to instantly hear and know what it is, just like I can instantly distinguish a major from a minor chord. Do you have any advice? Many thanks",
        "answer": "yes one thing to remember with 'diminished' chords is, the way they work is upside down. once you get that it starts to make more sense. so when you say the '7th', it actually doesn't really feel or sound like a 7th of anything. let me give you some examples... key of C. first chord C. second chord, just move the bass note up 1, and keep the other notes, so it's C#, E, G. that's C#dim. so it's like C but with the C note moved up. and the chord actually behaves almost just like A7. so a lot of songs may start C, C#dim, when actually it is a very close sister of C, A7. you'll notice this in a lot of songs, especially from the 1930s or 40s. On the subject of the \"diminished 7\" well that sounds pretty much the same. it's just a continuation of the diminished thing, it's all stacked 3rds, a very dizzy sound. and again to use the previous example, it would be like C7, then if you move the C note up and keep the rest the same that is just like C#dim7. and again, it's like a substitute for A7b9. wants to go to Dmin in both cases, and most often will. C, C#dim, Dmin. .... but the other one you asked about, half-dim, (or some people call it min7b5) again the 7th won't really feel like a 7th of anything, because diminished chords don't really sit on their feet, they hang from above, as i'm trying to explain, so actually generally what i would say is, a half-dim chord is gonna sound like a minor triad with a certain note in the bass. let's say, Fmin with D in the bass. that's what it sounds like. let's go to the key of Cmin, and let's say you have Fmin, G7, Cmin. if you take that chord sequence, and listen closely, and plug the headphones into your smartphone, you will notice secretly there might be a D bass note under that Fmin. that makes it Dmin7b5 (or D half-dim) instead. the names of these chords are kind of misleading and don't particularly feel like good names for them but that's just the names that are used. probably less so nowadays because this kind of literacy has fallen somewhat out of style .... but the example i just mentioned is generally the most common way you will hear those chords used. the main thing to remember here is that diminished chords mostly mostly mostly usually nearly always do NOT stand on their own and are not used on their own. so if you start to think too much about the chord individually it will not seem to make sense. yet it occurs very normally and commonly as part of a sequence. so the best thing you can do is just look at where it occurs in songs, and just become accustomed to those patterns. and then you will recognize the pattern. and when you hear that Dhalf-dim, G7, Cmin, you will instantly know it is either that OR Fmin, G7, Cmin. but you will have to plug in the headphones and listen close to see if that D bass note is there, to know for sure which it is. but you were asking about the difference between Ddim and Dhalf-dim, well i would say that those 2 aren't the ones you wanna tell the difference between, they're not really even that closely related. i'd say it's more about telling the difference between Dhalf-dim and Fmin. and the difference between Ddim and Bb7. and in both cases you would need to turn up the bass to hear the difference but there is not that much difference. the way you would tell the difference between Ddim and Dhalf-dim is just that they are used in different parts of the song. it's kind of like a wrench and a broom. you can usually tell which one is which because they are mostly not even used in the same context. but the biggest thing i can say, again, is just look at the songs and just find out what happens in songs they have a similar dizzying effect because you are stacking 2 minor 3rds or 2 major thirds in a row, pushing it out of key i hope you are doing this from inside a song and not outside. because dim and aug chords in particular are very much out of context if they are used outside of a song. and with aug, it's almost like borderline it's almost unfair that that one even has a name. because when you get into that territory it's like you're doing a song and you just need to change one note a certain way and you do it. and there might not really be a name for the chord. usually you don't just go around playing augmented chords .... the fact that it has a name make it seem like more of a solid/usable thing than it really is. in other words, the places it is used almost always seems like a sort of exception of some kind. there are many other patterns of notes that are sort of built out of all wholetones, etc, which are a complete mess to try to name. and i feel that a straight up augmented triad is in that family and is kind of unfair that that one gets such an easy name. and i've seen a lot of people get distracted early on trying to learn what it means and what its importance is, just because it gets brought up early in classes along with minor and major chords. but really it's something that should be discovered through songs, as needed. along with all the other things which may not have names"

Sure, there's some popular tunes in minor, but if you listen to the radio, you're not gonna hear a 50/50 balance between major and minor keys. It'll probably be more like 90(maj)/10 (min)? Like I was paying attention on my car ride to work this morning and I didn't hear 1 song in a minor key. I also think that a lot of the songs that are in minor have a strong pull towards the major chords in the key (like songs in Amin really wanna hang on that Cmaj at some point), and a lot of songs that could be minor have more of a minor pentatonic/blues scale feel than straight up minor.",

But you have never gotten around to think about any of this because you have learned to get absolutely everything done by using fonts in innovative ways. so as i said it's an entirely different door which i have avoided opening for a long time, and many people used to lecture me in the past about how i could never succeed without opening that door. but i never listened to them and i never opened the door, because i have always felt that i have had huge advantages otherwise. but i am now for the first time actually considering doing it. i only started considering this about 3 days ago but i'm really starting to think it might be a good idea. getting really sick of that fake banjo"

I wonder how to develop this kind of skill(my listening skills are extremely poor by the way, and if I try imagine the shape of music beforehand, either it's wrong or worse, only blankness) I think i'm a bit slow at this. Although I started learning piano at quite a young age, but since it's a keyboard instrument so all you have to do is use your eyes doing some sheet reading then press the keys, and since no one is there to tell me to pay attention to what you hear, until now i'm still lost when all the people there say the only right way to music is to use ear...",

'click' is a studio term for the beat of the song. it's what you would tap your foot to. i would say that would be your first exercise, which you may have aced long ago but i have no way of knowing how far along you are. my next suggestion is to see if you can hear them in groups of 4, throughout the song. most songs work like that ....."

        "question": "So I've noticed myself having really specific problems with making content. A lot of times I'll feel anxious during the day and that's when I most want to make stuff, and I think of all these great ideas during times like class, but then afterward, when I actually have the opportunity to work, I'm so relieved and relaxed by the day being over that I can't call up the same emotions that I had during the day and therefore can't create anything genuine. Is this a problem you had to deal with at all, and if it was, is the solution to just wait until you're in a position where you make your own schedule, or is it something else? thanks",
        "answer": "you'll need to learn to write down / save the ideas you have when you are away from the studio. this is where most of your best ideas might start. so you'll want to get good at catching them. nowadays almost any phone has more than enough capability to do this. just sing a quick demo and explain everything you need to know about the idea, and then when you get home add it to the list with a reference to the audio file / note"

I know and can play what each of these chords is, but I'm not sure where to go from here... so I make up a song and then work in whatever chords are not there, or do I start from the chords and make a song out of them? If I could I would just take what the chords feel like to me and how they work together and make a song perfectling meshing all their characteristics to make something new, but I'm not quite that experienced in songwriting yet, so I don't think I'm able to (if it happens like that, though, I will not object!).

        "question": "Hello Bill. The universe is so humongous big. And it's basically empty. So nothing that we do really matters. And yet it does. Because we are a small spark of self-consciousness in what appears to be a never-ending expanse of lifelessness. There is all of this stuff here, but it's so far apart in all of this nothingness. It doesn't matter, because we are so small, and yet it's the only thing that matters because we the planets are all that really exist. Going around stars that give us heat and energy and life and brought us into this world and keep us safe in their gravity wells. This solar system is our playground and we're both spoiling and squandering it. So many beautiful worlds that we could get to know. The things we aren't doing could save us from our eventual demise, and the things that we are doing are speeding it up. We are trapped on this planet by our own ineptitude and our own inability to just be cool to one another and try to think ab out how cool the universe is. That's why I like you. You make music that's chill and gets people thinking about how cool shit is. I want to help make more people think about the universe before it's too late because they've just been thinking about themselves. I feel lost and confused and don't know how to start. I tried some stuff but it just got me in trouble and I lost my job because apparently music isn't professional and shouldn't be shared over work email. A lot of other shit happened too. Now I'm broken and tired and just want to run away to the wilderness but it doesn't exist anymore, especially not in the polluted and soon-to-be-underwater concrete hellscape that is Florida. I'm lost and confused and finding hope in your music even though I hate what trying to follow in your footsteps has done to my life. I just wanna run away from the bad. I just wanna run towards the good. I just wanna run. And yet all I can seem to do is cry for the mistakes we as a living planet have ma de and t he things we have done to ourself. I love this universe. I hate this universe. It's fascinating and brilliant. It's horrible and cruel. It has so much potential and so much risk. I just want to help it. And yet I feel so incapable of doing so. Can we please just start to be a real planet with real goals and dreams and impressive accomplishments instead of a ball of fighting jerks that will destroy itself? I don't know what to do anymore.",
        "answer": "we are getting there and have been getting there for a long time. we have made crazy progress. i did some world history research and found out we all used to be rocks for an extremely long time. then some how we discovered, 1 bit at a time, how to have more fun. and each discovery is faster and wilder than the previous"

So if I say that, everyone will understand that e.g. the \"e\" syllable is before the \"&\"? I've seen a couple questions and answers on here that seem to use this kind of notation. Also, how do you count odd time signatures that way? Do they have standardized ways of saying them as well? How does it all work?",
        "answer": "i'd say so. it's spelled 1 e & a yes, it's also like an address for when a note is. if you say a note is \"on the and of 4\" that means it's the last 8th note of the bar. if you say something is \"on the a of 2\" that would be the second 16th note in the second beat, in other words the 6th 16th note of the bar would be the same probably, unless it's like 6/8 or 9/8 or 12/8 etc, which by convention are usually based in groups of 3 8th notes. less so"

        "answer": "it's tricky because when you're playing along to a record, there is already accompaniment there. so actually there's probably already too much if you are playing too. also if there is already a bass player, you need to not play root notes in the bass, unless you are entirely sure that you and the bass player will play exactly the same thing at exactly the same time. it will be helpful if you can get some kind of play-along recording which has your instrument muted"

There will always be brilliant people and beautiful art, but I think almost every person has gained a high dependence on cell phones/social media/internet in just the last 5-6 years. These are companies like Instagram, Facebook, Whatsapp, Youtube etc that algorithmically feed content to entire societies, and/or keep them hooked using techniques that are known to be addictive. The whole IM thing too is a very unnatural way to speak to other people. I think all of this combined is disastrous for attention span, creativity, and normal social skills. Do you think this is okay, and just a natural development of humanity? Or do you think that people should use less internet? Or maybe it's just not a problem at all.

        "question": "Bill, I wanted to talk to you about something. I think that throughout my career as a musician I have contracted a virus that I can only identify as \"bridge section fanatic syndrome\" or something. It happens even with the classics, to me. Name an artist, I will likely be a fan of their bridges or \"c sections\" alone, even with their most classic songs. It happens with music from all eras (although lately I'm finding a lack in true bridge sections as an entity, if you will, specially in hip hop and trap, even though I enjoy a lot of the music). Those sections are NOTHING without the context of the song but somehow I find myself listening to the entire thing just to get there and enjoy them, justified in my enjoyment for having given that section it's moment to shine (not isolated) but preferring it to the rest of the track nonetheless. It's really weird and it just hit me, thinking about it. I find myself writing songs and instrumentals as strong as I can with the purpose of having the thrill of creating a bridge that I love, just for that piece of music. Does anything like this happen to you? Thanks for reading this convoluted text, I'm in the middle of a tornado of self discovery.",

        "answer": "just 1 it seems to me that's not heavily debated ..... 99% of today's music seems to be at a=440, because that's what all music programs are tuned to unless you crawl around in the settings 440 we are living in a time where there is more agreement about tuning than ever before. because everything's digital, and programs default to 440. most people are pitch correcting their vocals, and it would be 440. even just 30 years ago, things were all over the place because things were on tape, and the speed could get changed either deliberately or not. my decision to stay in tune with the rest of the world is actually mostly out of convenience for other musicians. it happens to be very convenient that almost everything is 440, because if you have an instrument in your hand you can play along with anything. and when that old tape tune comes on that's out of key, you basically can't play to it unless you feel like re-tuning. it may sound fresh to avoid 440, but it doesn't ultimately make a difference, and it is very convenient for all the players out there if i stay in 440"

        "question": "if it's so important for you to have the exact date your content was created/finished on your website, rather than the date it was published, why do your song dates still show the same day as the videos? Clearly you have to finish them one or two days early for them to come out the same day as the videos. For example \"just did a bad thing\" came out today, 12/17 but you will probably list it as 12/18 in the song page. What gives?",
        "answer": "almost everything in existence has a range of dates that are significant for it. for example, these questions have 2 dates/times that would be significant: the time you asked it, and the time i answered it. (actually this question seems to have 3 dates associated with it, because it appears to be copied from a question composed around 12/17) but for simplicity's sake i must choose 1 date which i think is most appropriate, based on the type of content it is. showing 2 or more dates for 1 thing is just too many numbers to take in, and does not appear clear at all. so depending on what type of content it is, the date which i feel best represents that piece of content may be derived a different way. the making of this website has been an ongoing attempt to organize things as clearly as i can, but again and again the reality will defy the categorization system in subtle ways. but i can hardly complain about that because that's just something our world loves to do. also the song was released on 12/18 not 12/17. but with advanced technology it may have been transmitted to you from a more easterly time zone which may have reached 12/18 sooner than you"

        "answer": "i personally can't stand roman numerals for chords, but that's just because i haven't spent any time learning to read them, and arabic numbers (1,2,3) work fine for me. but it would be bVIIsus2 i think, assuming VII means 7 which i think it does"

        "question": "12.20.18 7:55 pm sorry for the confusion. here's my question: isn't it innacurate to call B E F A Bmin7 (b5) since that chord symbol doesn't account for the 11 in the chord? would something like Bmin7 (11b5) be more accurate? also, is it typical to hear both a natural extension and the augmented extension of the same note in the same voicing (like how this chord contains both the 11 and the #11)? thanks",
        "answer": "yea, it's iffy. Bmin7b5 kind of suggests you'd have D instead of E. but the specific notes you mentioned don't have an easy happy looking chord symbol. like Fmaj7b5/B would be the best i could do, and precise, but still obnoxious to read decent i guess. but whoever reads that will probably put a D in so be ready for that if you write that for someone at some point i think there is a sort of matrix that falls away and you realize that the way you are using the word 'extension' really means nothing. it may be an extension in terms of which year you may learn it in school. but in the real world i can't think of any reason to say which note of a chord should be considered an 'extension.' i think it will throw you way off to think of it that way. but as far as using E and F in the same chord, try it and see. the chord you gave seems weird but in context it could be fine. don't forget to play it in the song and not out of the song"

But I guess just... if you're struggling, please look into seeing a therapist or a psychiatrist. I love your content and I think you're a pretty damn swell guy.

        "answer": "i think it's an illusion, based on the fact that it has been taught to you in the same context as major and minor chords. but it's really not that. it's actually 1 of many variety of whole tone based chordal situations. which are not happy nor sad but kind of tense feeling. and they are best used as transitions, usually, .... and the one particular arrangement that may have been taught to you as an 'augmented' chord (the augmented triad) is just 1 of many ways to use that stuff if you get in a time machine and go to the late 70s and check out some minor key r&b songs, i think you may find that the 5 chord will be something like this: say it's the key of C minor, you're gonna see something called Gaug7 which has G in the bass and then it has F, B, and Eb in the chord. but this is not quite the thing you are talking about, although it is more common than the thing you are talking about. and it is still used today not just in the 70s"

        "question": "11.29.18 11:09 am If you think it would be fun, would you care to explain long long long journey?",
        "answer": "came up with the chorus first. then i had to find verses. actually found the verse melody before any lyrics. knowing the chorus but not knowing the verse that starts the song is a very strange mystery to solve sometimes. writing forwards you can just ask what comes next. but figuring out what came before (writing backwards) is really strange. but after finding the verse melody, i started searching for lyrics, and 'remember' seemed to work best. 'i wonder if you remember' ... 'i remember the morning ...' 'do you remember the morning you said that it's over' ... i'm just reading what i wrote down in that writing session. these were all brainstormed lines for the first verse before i found the real thing. 'i wonder if you remember the place that we came from' . none of these are good enough .... ' i remember the first time i said something intelligent' ... 'i remember the moment i left where i came from ' ... 'i remember the first thing i said when i got here' ... There are some slightly more interesting ones but i can't tell you them. 'i'm slipping under the blanket where nobody sees me' i don't know if that was supposed to be for the first line or for another line but it fits the same melody. i can see the post card lyric floating around here. actually took quite a bit of brainstorming before the actual first line came to me (moment that my dreams were broken) and i very distinctively knew that had to be it. and then from there it's just coming up with lines are good enough. keep coming up with lines until one of them seems good enough. then keep going. etc. that's about all there is to it. and if you don't have a deadline you will never think anything is good enough, and if you have a deadline you still won't think it's good enough but that will force you to come up with something that is almost good enough maybe"

I want to pay you for them, knowing that they are given freely (and have them conveniently in one place for lazy people like me) How does your handwriting as animated in some videos compare to your usual handwriting--stylized in any major way, as far as you're concerned? It's super neat.",
        "answer": "to pay me, you can use one of these options nowadays handwriting is hardly required for anything. but when it is i suppose it would look the same"

        "question": "i must say that i think the \"i just did a bad thing\" videos is one of your strongest visual offerings. i listened to the song a *lot* in the week between when it came out and when the music video came out, and the video still managed to add to the thoughts the song generates in my brain. it was totally worth the extra week to make it the way that it ended up being. Would you consider making the schedule more flexible to accommodate the extra time that ends up needing to go into certain things? You've mentioned things like releasing songs/videos on every other tuesday and anything videos on the other tuesday, but I would support a more low-key thing where the deadline was that you had to release *something* every tuesday, but depending on what ended up getting finished, it could either be a song, music video, and 30-second anything video, or just a 5-second anything video.",
        "answer": "no, the extra time this time was not spent making anything better. it was spent in an absolute state of panic and meltdown. and i am not confident that the product was any better as a result, in fact i am quite sure it was weaker tried that from january 31, 2018, and it became instantly clear that songs would be impossible in this time frame. it would have been all non-song videos if i had continued with that 'we'll see' approach can't leave it up to 'what ends up getting finished'. then it will never get finished. trust me, i've been through this many many times before i'm not disrupting the 2 weeks song schedule. it's the best thing that ever happened to me, and in the last month i've been a complete mental and emotional meltdown as a direct result of its temporary failure"

        "question": "there's a thing that comes up among people who are self taught with music or whatever people who do that are said to have \"gaps in their knowledge\"-stuff people with more formal education learned in school about proper technique or whatever. i always think that's a little strange to say because everybody has gaps in their knowledge, just the people who studied in school have all filled the same gaps. how do you recommend self taught musicians (like me) fill in those gaps? i kinda think if you pay enough attention to how other people do it, and you are somehow very relaxed yet focused, you can pretty much do whatever",
        "answer": "really it's just like learning to read. the words don't change if you can't read, but reading/writing will help you communicate with the wider world. i'd say just get some song books. learn to read them. now that the internet is a thing, you can pretty much just look up everything you need to know 1 by 1. but i think song books would be the best thing, not only to become literate but it will probably introduce you to more songs and make you a stronger musical person in general"

        "question": "Out of curiosity I slowed down Mount St. Helens to listen more closely to the rhythm of the vocals during the parts where it sounds like you're singing too many syllables over one beat (e.g. \"and it's gonna be a\" on beat 4 of measure 1). What it seems like you are consistently doing is having three accents during the beat (\"AND it's GONna BE a\"), but when I listened more closely you aren't doing a triplet feel over the beat, but rather, depending on the words in each particular occurrence, a 3-3-2, 3-2-3, or 2-3-3 pattern of 32nd notes (which fits better with the 16th note rhythms in the instruments than a triplet would). My question is: are you intentionally writing the melody with 32nd note syncopation like that? Or are you just thinking about doing 3 accents over the beat? Either way, I'm impressed. Either you're successfully performing a near-impossible rhythm that you've written, or you're naturally creating one by ear as you try to sing with the best feel you can.",
        "answer": "generally i'd say if you are hearing it differently as a result of slowing it down, that's probably not the way i was thinking it. i was writing it according to the speed it is on normal play mode"

        "question": "BILL I JUST SAW AN AD ON YOUR BALL & STICK VIDEO ARE YOU INSANE",
        "answer": "no, what happened is i finally realized once and for all that youtube is now recommending videos much more if they have stronger monetization. i have heard rumors that they would start doing this and knew they would eventually, but i proved it very clearly recently. because the ball and stick video was listed as #2 on trending when you click into the trending list, but, it was not showing up in recommendations where top 5 trending videos are supposed to show up. i did a test on a clean cookie-free (identity-free) browser, and went to youtube.com. on the front page of youtube, the top row of 5 videos is recommended trending videos. if you keep refreshing it, it seems to display mostly videos from the top 8 or so, switching around slightly with each refresh but usually mostly the same videos, all taken from the top of the trending list. but i refreshed it several times and mine was simply never there, despite being listed as #2 on the actual trending list. so i did an experiment and turned on 5 sec skippables for that video, and it instantly started appearing on the front page every time. so essentially this proves to me that the youtube algorhythm is strongly favoring videos with better monetization, which i always suspected would eventually be true. so essentially i can no longer trust youtube to give my videos a fair shake if they have the weakest monetization settings (i.e. display ads only). the good news is, i still offer all my content downloadable for free on billwurtz dot com, so they can be played in an offline video player of your choosing, which for me personally is the way i strongly prefer to watch content anyway. in fact i never even wanted to join youtube because i can't stand watching videos in an online streaming player. much prefer to download. but i gotta get the stuff on as many sites as possible, and play by their rules if necessary. after all that's probably how most of you found me"

You could infer that from what he's saying but I don't think he's directly said anything about multiple layers of simulations. Sorry i'm a bit obsessive and just wanted to clear that up. Genuinely curious what you think about that though, honestly the whole concept seems a bit wacky to me but i like to entertain wacky ideas sometimes I guess. Hoping you responded to my follow up with the quotes though, also keep in mind this idea isn't very unique to him, Nick Bostom formally proposed the theory back in 2003 I think.",

HOJ and HOTEWIG are also a musical journey in their own right, but I feel that music in them is more of a supporting element rather than the main focus. Although music is your main thing you've mostly delivered it on a single to single basis or taking part in a preexisting narrative. Not asking for an album here (which you mostly consider to be a collection of songs in a specific order), but a longer than usual continuous piece of music, a musical journey in itself which takes the world again by surprise and reafirms them your place as a music person. Many people have the wrong idea that your main thing is history vids just because these are your biggest most ambitious pieces of content, and it seems to them everything else is just the inbetweens of your hist ory proj ects.

A6 is not a dominant 7 chord. and don't ask me what dominant means, it just means it includes b7. it is not dominating anything in any way. except actually it probably dominated the blues scene so hard that it was the only chord anyone ever used so they stopped saying dominant and A7 became the default shorthand for A dominant 7"

        "question": "So you seem like someone who is talented when it comes to making yourself get work done. So, I was wondering if I could like pitch you an idea that I thought of trying for myself to start making more music, and see if you had any feedback? idk. The plan would be for me to spend, for each song, three days on the melody, then three days on the harmony, then three days on the percussion, then three days on the bassline, and finish with two days to revise and edit. Do you think this is a good plan? Anyway, love everything you do! Keep it up! <3",
        "answer": "that method seems very strange to me, but it might work, if you are not used to coming up with everything all at the same time. my approach to the over-whelm of not knowing what to do would be to just simply make much much much much much shorter products. and if it still doesn't work try making it shorter. a good example of the first one i did on this strategy was \"die\", literally only syllable. 1 word, 1 syllable, 1 melody note, 1 chord, 1 bass note, 1 kick drum, etc.... conceived of quite instantly, and recorded very quickly, because it was very clear what to do. that one was supposed to be 1 second, so the next one can be 2 seconds, except i discovered that the ringing crash cymbal made it 2 seconds so i actually went shorter first and did one that was truly 1 second, which was 'bears', before moving onto 2 seconds"

        "answer": "you're gonna need the A note in that chord. like it's gotta be F7 over A. or A\u00b0, etc. it's like Db7. thought it actually is. forgive me, i've heard it only a couple of times mostly in stores. but if you look at my example earlier on the other chord, how i said F7 or A\u00b0 'same thing', ... so too Db7 and F\u00b0 are like the 'same thing.' and you'll notice just how the Adim one goes to Bbmin, you'll see that the Fdim7 is going nicely to Gbmaj7 at the top of the next cycle. which in this case could be Gbmaj7 or Ebmin9. i thought it was Gbmaj7 but i only heard it a couple times through a retail ceiling environment"

        "question": "How did the 'La de da de da de da de day oh' song come to be? It sounds so good to me! It probably was similar to the process of other songs, but I'm asking because, in my opinion, it really stands out, and I want to know more about it. Also, keep up the good work, I think 'Just did a bad thing' may be your best song yet.",
        "answer": "this may sound boring and technical but i wrote some of it on a writing session, then wrote a bit more of it on a writing session, and then finally wrote the remainder of the song during a writing session. that's the short story. the long story is, i was doing a writing session many many years ago after many years of not doing writing sessions. actually it felt like i had never done a writing session before, it had been so long. i know i did many years before that, but it seemed so far away and i'm not quite sure how i ever did it. too long ago to remember really, and the world had surely changed since then, mine and everyone else's. so i was doing something which i think might have been totally new, i was just writing. not in the recording thing, not trying to record and write at the same time, just writing. like on paper, and i had 1 instrument to play along to what i was singing, and weirdly it was an unplugged bass. which doesn't quite make sense but it was a quiet room and i was just using it to indicate chords. not play chords, but just play the bass notes to indicate chords. so a few things were written on that session, including a thing that looked like this. you may mostly recognize this verse, sort of mostly. but the chorus it goes to on this page (not shown) is completely different, and wraps up to a surprise twist ending very quickly, making it a probably less than 1 minute piece called, presumably, 'in the snow.' the snow not really being the chorus, the snow being the twist ending. so that's 'in the snow.' fast forward maybe 3 and a half years. i am getting my life togther and going through the stacks and stacks of writing sessions i've done over the years, and getting it all organized and doing writing on them, for days and days and days and days and weeks, a many months long writing-only period i call 'writing tare' when i worked only on writing for almost a year, and not starting any new ones, just updating/continuing/finishing/fixing on existing songs and fragments. very early on in this process, around september 2012, i took a look at 'in the snow,' made some small adjustments to the verse to make it stronger, the pre-chorus got changed from 'i'm gonna count to 3' to instead 'i'm gonna write a song'. therefore the old chorus didn't make sense (something about counting to 3 i assume) ditched it and wrote a brand new much brighter stronger chorus, which as you can see seems to be nearly exactly the la de da chorus. and then it sat there burning a hole in my shelf, as a ray of sunshine with a high standard i suppose i was afraid to live up to. fast forward to 2017, i've been actually recording songs, and videos of many different types, for many years at this point, and over the years the writing list had grown out of control, mostly from 2010 to 2013 but still even more later, so most of the time doing a song (recording + video) means going through the list and finding something i want to do. in post-hotewig i had made the decision to allow fragments to be picked (songs where only partial writing was done) so as to get something almost entirely new and finish the writing on the spot and record it. out of something like 400 to choose from, i manually got it down to about 41 finalists, planning to do a random number selection to choose. but i narrowed it down again manually to 27, and with agonizing fear i chose the number and it picked la de da. and then the next day i had terrible cold feet about it, thought it was lame and stupid. switched it to a slow song, switched it to another song, lost my mind, wasn't sure, and then somewhere around getting into the haircut chair (was planning on doing real video performance footage for this one) i was pondering a second verse after the bright la de da chorus, and the first 3 mall lines tumbled into my head quite readily. so at least that mostly solidified the song choice for me and gave it an extra push toward validity, and from there the decision was finalized and i quickly finished the writing and then went into production which took agonizingly long because it turns out going on camera in front of zillions of people can be scary if you haven't been doing it regularly that is nice of you"

        "question": "okay, so, this is long but hear me out. i live in super-serious college land with super-serious computer science people and i'm stuck here until summer, and then for the next 2 years (i'm already too deep to quit now). over the last three years or so i have been too afraid of being free. i live in this bubble where i pretend to be someone i'm not, even to the point where i'll just randomly want to burst out singing in public because i know it would cheer everyone up. i'm really a music and fitness guy who didn't have the balls to just try being a freelance musician, so i just relied on college. But now, i've realized college doesn't help me learn anything and also college sucks and i hate it.So basically, i'm a 5-year-old trapped in a young adult's body. i know that once i start being myself and fully commit to it, there will be no turning back to the old way of thinking, and i'm honestly completely okay with that, except i'm naturally a more \"out-there\" person than most people and many people i know, (including professors) can and have seen my assertiveness and certainty as disrespect or rudeness. I've requested a solo room so i can be a weirdo and make content in there without anyone judging me, so that's at least a start i guess. Point is, i'm going to change eventually, but the question is just time. My gut is telling me to break out of this mentality now, the sooner the better. I guess the question is, in your experience, is it beneficial to your insecurity around other people to start being yourself fully around them, or does just being yourself in front of a camera to the internet have the same effect? Basically i'm scared that if i just wait to become popular someday before i translate the skills to the real world, i'll just be even more hopelessly awkward when and if that time comes. i would love to just push myself to start now, but it's becoming increasingly clear that the only viable option is to ask for at least a tiny amount of validation from someone else before plunging headfirst into life-changing behavior. Any thoughts on this? Also how do you ask a follow-up question",
        "answer": "yes very different. much much more calculated it's quite simple, it just comes from actual experience. if you find yourself on stage regularly, you will inevitably get totally used to it and very strong there. if you find yourself around people constantly, you will very quickly get much better and stronger. a nice trick is to get a job, any kind of job, where you are around people. i think you will learn a lot about the world regardless of what kind of job it is. and just when you least expect it you will notice that you got some money somehow which you could use to buy some flashy new socks, and matching sandals what the heck is a follow up question"

        "question": "I have a weird situation. About four years ago I finally stepped into making and singing music after growing up in an family that believed music making, esp singing, is the realm of an elite few talented people. I always rebelled against this idea in my heart because but didn't participate in misic making until I left that environment about 4 yrs ago. anyways, after 4 years of singing w a vocal group I could just feel that my voice, my ears, improv and other abilities had become quite strong. About 6 mo ago I leveled up again in my understanding of music and began making/recording my own music and performing more on my own time, not just with my group. So, I know my strongest suit is harmony and singing with others, but recently at a mic night I sang a song (used a mic) by myself, no accompanymnent, which is a first for me. Icould hear myself during and it I was delighted that my voice both sounded and felt good, which i have learned are some of several markers that you are making a good, strong sound. But a friend recorded it, then sent it to me later. I watched it to see what it sojnded like from an audiences persective and it actually didn't sound great, not bad but not good. There were a few notes I thought I nailed but were actually a little shaky, and overall tone was not as strong as I had felt it was in the moment. This devastates me because my body and my ears to ears told me it sounded nice while I was performing, but the actual recorded audio denies this...I feel shattered. So now I am wondering if I should just halt all my musical persuits, if I still apparently am not a strong singer even after lots of practice over the last few years and a sense that I had grown into my own voice. I love making music more than anything, and my favorite instrument is voices because it feels so physial and raw to share music that way. but if my soundmaker is fundamentally gross than I feel the whole process is perverted from the get-go. So i'm looking for guidance from friends and musicians I trust: is there anything here that i mentioned you are familiar with and have advice for? and is it a good idea to trust that wonderful sensation inside you when you are singing that tells you the sound is pleasing? and thanks for fielding this long ask",
        "answer": "no i am familiar with doing something for a while and then getting to the point where you really feel like you are getting good. then doing it more and then really feeling like you are getting even better. you explained that part very clearly, and it's obviously true yes, that's the only thing there is don't forget to do more live appearances, as many as you can. and if you think there is a problem with the recorded result not being as good as you thought, then keep doing that too. you can learn that just the same as you learned all the other stuff you've learned. also don't forget, ............ singing without any chordal accompaniment is probably gonna be really really strange, unless you are singing music that was absolutely not written with chords"

        "question": "\"Just did a bad thing\" is the most addictive piece of music ive ever heard. it's structured so perfectly. what happened that made you come up with that song? i suppose my question is... what bad thing did you do, Bill Wurtz?",
        "answer": "nothing really, that first line is just one of many other song ideas from a song idea generating session. not even the best one, probably one of the worst actually. but the reason it got picked for recording was due to time constraints. i kept narrowing it down and ended up excluding all the choices for not being good enough until i narrowed it down to 1 but then i excluded that one too for not being good enough. 'bad thing' was excluded way earlier, because it was one of the least good. so after having eventually excluding them all for not being good enough, i realized i was at a dead end and the clock was running out so for a twist i just kind of picked one of the worst ones, and wrote it extremely quickly. this was actually an advantage, because when you try to make a bad thing good in a very short amount of time, you are forced to bring out your very best. it's kind of like when it's 8:59 and the bread store is closing at 9:00, you will discover some automobile maneuvering skills you perhaps didn't know you had, just to get that bread the ones i've done i usually put my name on"

        "question": "1.11.19 2:46 pm - Your answer sounds romantic but that's not the case. Most pop songs use the same I-V-vi-IV chord progression - there has to be something about this that is objectively more pleasing than other chord combinations to the human ear, else the same formula wouldn't work again and again as it does now to make hits. The number of combinations that achieve the same effect must be limited and there has to be a pattern to it. Isn't that what studying music is all about?",
        "answer": "yes it is actually more songs use 4, 6-, 1, 5 (same thing but different order) at least from about 1990-2015, but that trend may be starting to fade. for a long time the blues was most popular. but still these have never actually amounted to 'most music.' a 'plurality' possibly but not a 'majority' sorry for the statistics terminology yes but don't forget to put lyrics and melodies in too, or at least something besides just the chords, otherwise you might not have too much going for you"

The reason I ask this is because I've heard a con about being signed to a record label; that you have to make songs that will most likely sell and it would limit your ability to write new types of music. I've heard people calling this type of tactic \"selling out\". I've also heard that artists that are signed to certain record labels do want to make new music and they probably have a bunch of songs they wrote but the record label won't let them record it because its not guaranteed the song would sell. I don't know. What do you think?",

The part that I can't stop going back to over and over is when you talk about schedules, which are absolutely crucial for *getting things done*. Without them I've also noticed that there are just so many options, and you end up being all over the place, and one thing can go on forever. Now, I'm pretty darn good at planning and making schedules, but where I mess up is in the execution. I can't stick to my plans mainly because I get distracted. As soon as whatever was planned on the schedule starts getting a bit difficult, or uncomfortable, I stop doing it and switch to a non-planned activity such as reading the news on twitter, or some other lame thing like that. Now don't get me wrong, I really want to do the thing s that I 've planned and are on the schedule, I like those things and I feel enthusiastic about it, it's just that whenever it gets hard, I'm too weak. What's the secret to stick to the schedule no. matter. what.? I don't want to get old and be like: \"arghasdh... I was meant to do all those good things, but I was way too weak to end them D: ...I hate myself! \"",

        "question": "hey bill, it's the dom9no3 chord guy whose question you didn't follow when I initially asked it. This is what I was getting at (more fleshed out). The dom9 chord (e.g. G9: G-B-D-F-A) is probably the most consonant combination of 5 notes that we have in the 12-note scale. In lots of compositions, chords are more frequently thought of in 4 voices instead of 5 (thank u bach chorales), so we frequently encounter chords that are 4 out of the 5 notes of a dominant 9 chord. Using the G chord, we have G7 = G9 no9, Gadd9 = G9 no7, Dm6 = B hdim7 = G9 no1, and I sometimes also see G9 approximated in 4 voices by leaving out the 5th. These four are all pretty common chords, all quite consonant. But the 5th 4-pitch chord coming from the dom9 that should be just as consonant as the other 4 is G9 no3 = {D,F,G,A} = d minor add4. The frequency I see minor add4 chords in leadsheets and such is basically zero compared to the other 4 chords that are dom9 chords omitting 1 of the 5 notes. Do you feel there is a good reason for this? Is the the minor add4 chord lacking something musically that makes it rare compared to the other chords mentioned, even though it should \"\"theoretically\"\" sound just as reasonable?",
        "answer": "consonant? not sure what that means here i'd call it Dmin over G, which is rampantly common, especially in the 1970s 'funk' sort of things. it can be used in the place of G9 or Gmin9. you wouldn't have to specify. james brown songs use these all day. i use them all the time if you put the bass on G, which i think is where it's supposed to be according to your study, i think you will find it much more commonly. or actually perhaps the lead sheet will just say G9 or Gmin9 but in reality the execution will leave out the 3rd this study is not really taking account for where the bass is i'm not following why it 'should theoretically' sound just as reasonable, but if you feel it has been under-used, you now have an opportunity to find and demonstrate its goodness. if you find that it really is not so good, then it is only you who can explain why you don't like it"

        "question": "Hey, i'm just now learning about intervals and harmonies and stuff and i've been listening to this song and it just confused me. (https://youtu.be/GC6nSX67Q-4?t=31 i linked to the relevant part at 31 sec). Listen to the guitar melody, it has these notes in it, ignoring all the little thrills and slides, - F# B A C#. And then the second guitar comes in and harmonizes over the first and I figured out that the harmony is a minor third (correct me if im wrong). But here's the confusion: the notes in the harmony are A D C# E, and A D E are all a minor third of the corresponding notes in guitar 1 - F# B C#. BUT the C# in guitar 2 is a MAJOR THIRD away from the A in guitar 1. And it sounds bloody cool. What's going on here, why isn't that C# a C, and why does changing that one note make it sound so much better?",
        "answer": "let's skip the harmony and just look at melodies. in most songs, they don't use all the notes. they tend to use some, but kind of skip the ones in between. typically if you lay out all 12 notes in order, xxxxxxxxxxxx, an ordinary song for example usually is only gonna use these notes 0x0x00x0x0x0. you'll notice that's uneven. and if you're wondering what happens when it's completely evenly distributed: 0x0x0x0x0x0x, well you'll notice it sounds like you are spinning around. i've still left most of life's most important questions unanswered, but hopefully this is a more direct way of accessing the conundrum you mentioned, which has nothing to do with harmony"

Because I would think you'd want to leave the music 100% in your control but get editors to speed up the video making (which i seem to remember you saying take longer to do than music). In that case you would be like a movie director directing the editor. But also the master because any editor you hire would have to go through an apprenticeship to understand your methods. Also, it would finally be a good time for you to update your software because the editor would be using the new software so he would teach you about it while you tutor him on your process. But I guess you'd certainly need more money to be abel to also pay the editor. All in all it could be cool. Do you agree with my assessment or were you thinking something different?",

I tried some different harmonies over that melody i already mentioned (with notes F# B A C#) and I found that D G F# A over that melody also works in a cool way? How come when G isn't in the A major scale at all (i think G is a diminished 7 in that scale, correct me if im wrong)? Is there any rhyme or reason of why some things apparently work and some don't? Like some broken rules get you an even cooler thing but if you break some other rule it gets you a bad thing? Or is my knowledge of the rules so bad that i'm not actually breaking any just discovering new rules i didnt even know about?",
        "answer": "yea that would be almost like you are in the key of D it's in what you might call the A \"cool\" major scale, the ancient greek name for that being \"mixolydian.\" which also happens to be the exact same notes as the regular key of D, if you rotate the room around flat7 scientists will never quite figure it out but they will keep trying it is essentially the same rules that make you like someone's personality, or enjoy a story, or find beauty in patterns of soap scum"

My life is pretty good, but... I don't really have hobbies or personal projects that I do. It makes me feel super unaccomplished. All I'm acheiving are some numbers in a grade book for some distant promise that I can use them to get a decent job. That's it, that's my life. I study and I get good grades. It frustrates me to no end. I want something unique to me! I'm not going to be in high school forever, and I want something to carry with me to college and beyond. What I'm asking is if you have struggled with similar things, and how you overcame them.

Is this true for you or were there actually things you had to sacrifice to get good? Because I have a feeling therewas never anything in your life that you liked more than music, not money, not school, not friends.

        "answer": "could sound bad if taken out of context of course you can actually, this is a fun fact about D7, G7, anything7, ...... those chords are founded on 'incorrectness.' it's kind of like the evil monster character in a movie. you may look at that character and think 'aah, ... scary' ... but is that wrong? no it's actually very right for the movie, especially for the scary parts of the movie well you're gonna have to decide. and if they all sound bad to you then it couldn't possibly be very much fun, so at that point you would want to find something else that you do enjoy whenever you get the big thrills, always make a mental note of when that happened, and any circumstances surrounding it the only leading authority on this is you i guess my first question is, is there any music you enjoy"

        "question": "I personally hate astrology, but I have a couple of friends/acquaintances/family members who are into it and from what I can tell, the attraction of astrology isn't that it can predict the future. 99% of astrology fans don't know if Mercury is in retrograde or what that even means. They couldn't identify a single one of the zodiac constellations in the actual night sky. The attraction of astrology is that it's an elaborate personality test that encourages a lot of self-reflective navel-gazing, which some people enjoy and find beneficial. For instance, the \"typical\" positive Aries traits are courage, daring and competitiveness, while the negative traits are self-centeredness, anger and pushiness. Obviously, not every person born in the month of April has these as their dominant traits... but pretty much everyone has these traits present to some extent, so they'll reflect on this crude psychological assessment. An Aries who actually is dari ng and c ompetitive might acknowledge that they come off as rude or attention-seeking to others. And an Aries who's naturally shy might feel empowered by a personality test that tells them that deep down, they're courageous and decisive. Astrology books that promise to give relationship tips for Capricorns and Libras (or whatever) are actually just full of basic good communication advice that will probably smooth a relationship between any two people. So people can feel like they're getting real benefit from astrology. If people really don't feel like their personality fits their sign, they can get a fancy natal chart done that will tell them that even though their sign in Taurus, the position of Jupiter or whatever counteracts their Taurus traits and makes them a true Scorpio. Astrology is just a very elaborate, mystical personality test that you can manipulate to get whatever results you want. It's really not that different from the MBTI personality test, which is extrem ely popu lar among \"rational\" people even though it's junk science. People like personality tests and astrology because people like thinking about themselves and coming up with fancy terms to express their identity.",
        "answer": "astrology is often hijacked and re-purposed as a 12-option personality test, but that's not what real astrology actually is"

        "question": "Hi Bill. I saw a video about Disclosure's song \"Latch\" where it said the song was in Bb dorian and went i > v > IV > III. Someone in the comments said no, it's clearly in Ab major and goes ii > vi > V > IV. Someone else said no, it's in F minor and goes iv > i > VII > VI. It was all a bit silly and it made me wonder if I should just analyze all songs in a major key even if they're minor or another mode. E.g. it seems a lot easier to just remember that vi > IV sounds cool rather than remembering both vi > IV and i > VI since they are the same notes. Do you see any downsides in only thinking about chords from an \"ionian perspective\"? (this might be a cool math rock band name) Or are there benefits in calling the vi chord the i chord if the song is in a minor key?",
        "answer": "if it's an ambiguous case, i generally will gravitate toward the 'ionian perspective' as you call it. i would surely consider Latch in Ab, especially when you look at the melody. Some songs may be much more strongly anchored to that 2 root, where you would definitely wanna say 2 dorian. like miles davis \"so what\", no one is going to say that's in C. or \"uptown funk\", no one's gonna say that's in C. it clearly lives its life in D dorian, period. There are many many ambiguous cases, especially when you can't decide whehter to take the \"ionian perspective\" or the relative minor (\"aeolian perspective\", as you might say). Like a song that is firmly in A minor in the verse, then does F C G G for the chorus, obviously the chorus is in C. Or the ever so popular perpetually looping Amin F C G sequence, that's the most famously ambiguous case. The whole thing sounds like it's in C except that the first chord is actually Amin. Some songs are ambiguous as to which way you'd call it, but the melody is really what holds the answers"

(or does it sound good? i forgot if you ever stated an initial opinion on that.....) The important thing to take with you for the rest of your life is that you now have some idea of what D and E chords can do in the key of A minor, and the feels it can bring, etc. Then with some simple extrapolations you could deduce that the same feels could also be produced in the key of Bbmin, with Eb and F chords. and so forth"

        "question": "I write my music by ear but can't get away from the same root-bass functional chords, for example Eb,G,Bb,D - DFAC and the like. I'll at least mix things up and put the 7th-tonic rub in the middle of the chord instead of on top, or find myself splitting 5ths doing root and 5th in the left hand and 3 and 7 in the right an octave up, a sus here and there but CAN'T seem to unlock my understanding of more \"colored\" (if you will) or nonfunctional chords and get into chromatic harmony and other techniques I hear in your writing. I'm not asking you to tell me \"play these chords\", but rather if you can suggest reading/watching something to expand my palate of harmony. (have basic diatonic theory under my belt)",
        "answer": "first thing, think about the entire song not just the chords. if there's melody and lyrics in the song, do everything in service of that. and the other thing you might want to practice is playing all chords within a very small range. the order of notes you may have learned in school is kind of a myth. chords don't really belong in that order. i think if you play through some charts and deliberately play everything right around the middle C range, flipping as necessary to fit in that range, i think you will learn very quickly. also put the bass note an octave or 2 below, and if the chord has more then 4 notes then leave the bass note out of the right hand. i think you will learn things very quickly that way"

        "answer": "just find the harmonies 1 note at a time. go thorugh the entire song and add just 1 note to 1 moment. see if you can find that special moment that really needs it, and find out which note it needs. I'll give you one to get started. \"Celebrate good times come on\", that party song from the 70s. playing that vocal part all the way through, no band, no harmony, and i have to decide 1 moment to add 1 note. i'm gonna say for \"come on\", not the first but every 2nd and 4th time of \"come on\" in the choruses, let's add a maj 3rd above the voc melody. so if the song is in Ab, let's add the C note above \"come on\", not the first time but the second and 4th time it occurs in the choruses. ok now you pick a song, with just the melody, and pick what you think is the most important spot to add 1 note to. or if you want, you can find another one for the song i did"

        "question": "In a Philosophize This Podcast, there is discussion between Faciticty and Trancendance. Facticity is the third person perspective that any other person can take. These facts include biological facts about height, weight, race, gender, skin color, eye color, etc. However, these facts also include social and economic, psychological and historical facts as well. Transcendence is the first person perspective of a human being. With transcendence, human beings can \"transcend\" their facticity and become something more than they are or seem to be. This \"something\" they can become is a result of that human beings individual choices or decisions, and many turn it in to a tug-a-war situation in life. People who want both 100% of transcendence and facticity basically want to be god is some sort, \"can do no wrong but has ultimate power\". So my question is what is your take on this, is there a possible balance you choose when it comes between the two?",

        "question": "hey so i commented a while back on wether not i should talk to a certain girl or not and over the months theres been some developments but long story short, 3 months ago she definitely found out, she might have suspected before then but she definitely knew then. not a lot happened over the next bit between us or anything (as if anything had really happened before) but then valentines day rolls around and i think to make her a sort of gift with some contact info and a song playlist i made for her. she hasn't responded or checked the playlist. which she does not have to, she doesn't owe anything to me, but i just feel awful. i honestly would have felt better if she had just flat out told me that she didn't care for me but no, nothing. i had heard many rumors that she may have been interested in me at somepoint earlier on or something like that this year, but now nothing. i dont honestly even care about starting a romantic relationship with her at this point as much as i do just establishing a relationship period, however i feel that my ship has already sailed. do you have any advice bill on what i should do, i she hasnt left my concious in over 2 years and i still want to think i have some sort of chance to maybe get to know her but i fear i may just be floating, or over thinking too much, thoughts?",
        "answer": "i think the problem is that your feelings for this person (or, the strong feelings you are having whilst looking at them) are way ahead of how well you actually know them. so i would venture to say that a significant portion of your feelings are based on what you have imagined the person to be like, not entirely who they really are. simply because you don't actually know them very much. this can be slightly inconvenient for you when they don't respond in accordance with what you imagined, but can be particularly unsettling for the other person, if they find out how strong your feelings are despite not knowing them"

        "answer": "it depends what you mean by record, but i can overcome almost any restriction. for example if i have no instrument but i have my phone, i can explain how it goes, sing it and explain any necessary contextual info to understanding what it's made of. if i absolutely cannot speak or make any sound, i could use staff paper but 99% of the time if i can't speak then i am likely in a situation with no staff paper. but i have a number system i can use to write melodies on paper without staffs, but let's face it, paper and pencil wouldn't usually be available unless i could speak. so really in that case we're talking about phone text. i do have a system of fully writing down melody, lyric, and chord information using only phone text. unfortunately it takes 3 full lines of information just to convey 1 line, plus any additional descriptive info needed, plus autocorrect kicks your ass on that stuff, but it can be done. it's rare that i would need that, and typically that gets used the most on airplanes. in the rare situation where i have absolutely no writing device available (no phone, etc), then i would need to engage in deep mental communication activities to try to remember the situation from as many angles as possible (in other words, pretend i wrote it down and imagine every logistical aspect of what that would contain, and imagine explaining it to someone else who knew nothing about it) and keep analyzing it in different ways until the documentation tools become available, which usually would not be that far in the future. but most of the time there is at least voice memo or phone text available"

Do you only work when you're \"inspired\" (whatever that means for you) or do you sit down to work even when you don't have particularly inspirational ideas and build them as you go? There seems to be this whole thing built up around inspiration and we even have the word \"eureka\" and everyone knows how the apple dropped on Newton's head or how Paul heard \"Yesterday\" in his sleep etc. On the other hand, many artists say that they work on a schedule (like you) and that seems to work too. Steven King says he writes 6 pages every day. So either he has an inexhaustible well of inspiration hidden somewhere or he doesn't need inspiration all the time to make progress on his books.",
        "answer": "it might be what created this entire universe no you need both. inspiration is the free energy that makes all this possible, but unfortunately it can be extremely extremely disorganized. so if you listen to only direct inspiration for your immediate agenda, you will find yourself extremely confused at least half the time, on average, despite the fact that inspiration is what any agenda was originally created by"

I feel like I'm always wanting to write these grand opuses out of my ideas, treating them like they have boundless potential and that I should only see them through to their maximum potential while also wanting spend time getting better at my instruments, spend time listening to other people/learning, going to work etc. and i slowly chip away at everything but nothing gets done. I may have fear of letting go of the attachment to my ideas and wanting to make them so grand. Did you have any hard time transitioning from not having a schedule to having a schedule? Did you have to set yourself time limits or alarms to remember to do certain things and move on to the next? Has having the schedule made you not just more productive in general as a result of it, but gradually increased your capacity to be more productive over time of consistently adhering to it?",

        "question": "do you ever think of chords/voicings as a stack of intervals instead? Like, M3m3 would be a major chord expressed by a major third followed by a minor third. But in first inversion itd be m3P4, a minor third with a perfect fourth after it. Kind of what the idea is with roman numeral inversions, having I be root, I6 be first inversion (with implied third as middle voice, and the 6th being the top voice interval with bass note), and I64 for second inversion, (6th and 4th intervals from bass). Except this system ive been trying to figure out would show the relationship between each note to their closest note up and down. Ideally itd show all relationships, But I think intervals as a unit make sense trying to categorize chords not only by what notes are being played, but their inversions. Sometimes it feels like this way \"harmony\" or \"notation\" would make more sense. Best way I can think of it is a stack of geometry upwards like a totem, or stacked figures using the same center (with their corners touching the same imaginary circle). Do you have a specific way you visualize/categorize relationships in music and how did you come upon it?",
        "answer": "sure visualize it on the piano keyboard the piano keyboard is wonderful because all the notes are laid out right in front of you in perfect order, but i am not the one who came up with it. for that we must thank John Piano"

        "question": "I'm doing karaoke with my coworkers this weekend. I'm decently confident that I can do the actual singing, but like... I'm so used to having an instrument in my hands. Between lines/verses/etc. what do you do with yourself when you have no instrument??? Just stand there? Breakdance? Bop and sway gently? I saw one of my favourite bands live in 2010 and the lead singer/guitarist sang one song with no guitar. Between lines, EVERY SINGLE TIME, he would take two steps back from the mic, look to the left, inhale, and swing his right arm back and forth to the beat in a comically wide arc without moving any of the rest of his body. It was painful to watch and I don't wanna replicate it. Do you have any suggestions about what I *should* do?",

        "question": "2.28.19 7:07 pm what the fuck. not subtitling your videos is plain fucking dumb. do you know what would happen if you subtitled your videos? more people would be able to understand them, therefore, you would amass a much greater following, and millions more people would be able to enjoy your work. I understand you probably think that your shit is far too complex to understand without rerecording vocals and rewriting English text, but I can assure you in the nicest way possible, it is not. I think that people who don't speak English would just be appreciative of the fact that they have a translation of the video and would not ask for any more than that. I also think that a lot of people would prefer to enjoy your videos in their original format than have a redone one. and like you said, it is basically impossible (at this point in time at least) for you to make these kinds of redone videos. so the way see it is you have two options: keep community subtitles off and only let the English speakers understand what the fuck your saying, or turn them the fuck on and be fucking nice to people who weren't born in an English speaking country. I'm sorry but it makes me mad that you refuse to do a simple thing that would mean sooooo many more people would be able to enjoy your shit. thank you for doing what you're doing. you are one of my favourite artists. have a lovely night.",
        "answer": "are you sure this is the nicest way possible it's kind of like nudity. maybe a lot of people would like to see you nude, but you might personally feel as though you want to be careful about just how they see you, because for some reason it may be a personal/sensitive issue, how you are seen. then add in the feeling of someone being extremely angry at you for not getting naked immediately i thought you said earlier you were going to be fucking nice if i was comfortable with it being released with the integrity of the material being significantly compromised and weakened, i would have possibly released it 3 months earlier with crappier graphics, no score, and worse narration. but instead i chose to spend the extra time to make it as good as possible, whilst zillions of people were breathing down my neck threatening to frown at me for not releasing it before it was done"

        "question": "3.3.19 11:54 pm any of the things you play, really, though i am curious especially about the ones we see in videos. 1. singing and playing keyboard (i have to work v hard on this because two hands are doing two different things but then once i have the muscle memory i can put the vocals on top of it more easily) 2. singing and playing drums (i know you said it does not appeal, but you are rhythm wizard so i just wondered if you are good at it) 3. singing and playing bass (i find this particularly hard because the bass rhythm is so often different from the melodic rhythm) 4. singing and playing another strummy thing like for example a baritone ukulele (more rhythm problems for me)",
        "answer": "usually if i'm playing and singing i'm not playing an exactly memorized keyboard part. also if you are playing by yourself, then your left hand will probably only be playing 1 note at a time (bass). but what i would suggest is just start out with a much much simpler part. once you reach the magic threshhold of simple enough to do, you will watch yourself magically and randomly start to sprout new techniques out of nowhere i am usually not interested in singing lead while playing drums, only backups. but i think what generally happens the first time, for example, is you will sing something on beat 1 and accidentally hit the snare on beat 1 (when you weren't supposed to). and then you go 'oh crap i can't believe that just happened' and then you never do it again. that's the main thing to watch out for i've never done this. the most difficult thing i think would be durations. playing a long note while singing a short note, etc. that seems to be the most natural and easy thing. although i don't really play guitar"

        "question": "So in music chords I'm very confused about 7ths in particular. From what i see, it's usually only notated with \"7\" and sometimes \"M7\". But aren't there 4 different ways to make a 7th chord? e.g. for C it would be (C E/Eb G B/Bb) so the only way of notating them for me that would make sense is something like \"mM7\" or \"mm7\", etc. This gets even more complex when it gets to 9ths etc. I am such a noob for even asking but what does \"7\" mean after a chord? is it context based, and when/why would you use each of the variations. Hope my question makes some amount of sense, I don't really know what to look up to find the answer",
        "answer": "7, maj7, min7, and maybe more Cmaj7 actually means it has maj 3 (note) and maj 7 (note). C, E, G, B...... Cmin7 actually means it has both minor 3rd and minor 7 (notes) in it. so C, Eb, G, Bb...... If you want E natural and Bb in it, that's just called C7. that's just what it's called. the full name for that is C dominant7, but don't be distracted by the word dominant, it's not really dominating anything. it's just called C7. if you want the Eb note but B natural, that's called Cminmaj7, and you probably won't see that very often Cmaj9 includes maj3, and maj7, and 9. so C, E, G, B, D (notes do NOT have to be in that order and probably will sound better in a different order). Cmin9 again is like Cmin7 but with D note included. if you just say C9, that would be \"C dominant 9\" or just C9 (again, the word dominant makes no sense but that's just what it's called. abreviated C9, and it would be C, E, G, Bb, D. again, not in that order necessarily. so, Cmaj9, Cmin9, C9, etc. are all the same as Cmaj7, Cmin7, C7, but with D note added. If you actually wanted to add the D note but NOT have the 7 in there at all, it is usually \"add9\". so Cadd9 would be C, E, G, D. and Cmin(add9) would be C, Eb, G, D. not necessarily in that order. it is pretty common to put the D in the same octave as the other notes. also sometimes that may be called \"add2\" if you prefer. natural 3rd and flat 7. C7=C, E, G, Bb"

        "question": "it's not your responsibility to worry about how people react and analyze and think about your things, or you, or your relationship to your things once you release them, but i am over here Relating and having a weird crisis about the concept of celebrity and personhood and it's especially weird because i have this crisis all the time, it's an easy one: everybody's a person. just people. my favorite bands (if you will excuse the idea of favorites for a few moments): they're just people, and they are huge nerds who will give me corrections to transcriptions i make of their stuff cause they like the stuff and i like the stuff and that gives us something in common. my favorite actor: people. also a huge nerd who is excited about the things i am excited about, so we can be excited together at the stage door if i make it there. my favorite vocal ensemble: people. very good at their job, some of the best in the world, but you have to be a huge nerd to get that good and that means we're excited about the same things if we interact about them, because the tiny details get clearer the closer attention you pay, and then we can share the excite. there's a line in henry v \"the king is but a man, as i am. the violet smells to him as it does to me\" i think about whenever i am getting too close to putting a person whose work i like on a huge pedestal, and instead i get excited about how people whose work i admire are just people and i am too so i can do things too. however, it's an extra weird case to be so deeply involved in liking your stuff, because so much of your stuff is your story of yourself. first of all the songs and the history videos, of course things you make are going to have light from you shining in em. but even less removed from your Self the questions page, insta hints, reality videos, expert mode all have personality and then you come out with a live interview and a straightforward lyric explanation video, and what is there that i can Like that is not just a piece of you? is it the things you make i like, anymore? or is it what i can see of you? does it matter? not to you, probably. but it seems important for me to know. and maybe it is better for you if the glorious melodic contour has a bigger effect on me than the half-smile as you mark time before the next mime drum take. it's definitely the skill involved in setting up the turnaround that impresses and engages me, but if i associate that with the fondness that gets in my spirit from reading and empathizing about the door touch for the tempo run to find the split, what am i appreciating? is it the beautifully finessed fill that is unstoppably embedded in my psyche, now, or the endearing knowledge that you think nobody wants to see a band of 5 keyboard players? do i appreciate hotewig because of the awe-inspiringly constant level of fun and incredibly consistent density of information, or because it's your voice and your humor delivering it? both, i guess. i try to like things because they're good, instead of because i like the person who made them, but what if the person who made them is good? it'll be my job to try and extricate my inspiration by your content from my inspiration by whatever You i can know from what you've left in the open. it's not your problem. but it's jiggling my obsessive and analytical tendencies and now i'd kind of like to know if you've ever had this feel.",
        "answer": "one thing that seems to be particularly enticing to me is when i find someone who is doing things in a way similar to the way i would like to do it, AND that person seems to be quite successful. it's that killer combination that makes me want to learn everything i possibly can about them and their life"

You have described something similar for sound: to escape genre labels, cultural biases, and instead to consume songs for their pure audio content. Exploring this mentality both visually and aurally, I've met a discrepancy: Whereas in the audio world I have discovered flawlessly manufactured pop bangers of all kinds to enjoy the hell out of; I can't get the same feeling out of the visual equivalent: flawless make-up done up to picture-perfection.

        "question": "You talk about releasing an album a lot but would you want to write a bunch of music and set them aside for an album or just do a retrospective best of? I've always wanted to release an album of music I wrote but whenever I write a half decent song I just really feel the need to release it and put it right out there for immediate gratification. I'm wondering your thoughts on whether albums are actually antiquated and what I do now, which is basically the same as what you do now, might be a better strategy. I suppose the situation is different if the album is a \"concept album\" so to speak but, you know, that would be a whole different kind of project than what I would do, personally.",
        "answer": "that's not true of the 2 options you gave, i'd rather write for an album. retrospective not necessary, especially in the internet era when you can already find what you want i think albums are antiquated, and i think if you want content of that length there is no need to restrict yourself to a series of songs. tell the story. use music, pictures, scenes, everything combined. tell a story, even a musical story. but if it's really all just songs then just let the songs be songs. and if they really are that combined then let them combine more into a stew in which case it would not be an album it would be a musical story. an album (a list of songs) seems like an unhappy middle ground between songs and a movie/story/musical . but i think many many people may disagree with me, and many people still think about albums. i'm probably not a valid opinion here because i have never listened to music that way, and to my surprise i've never found an album that even feels like the songs are in the right order. i think the 'right' order of songs probably changes from day to day. ALSO, another thing i just thought of, if a song is really really good, then i think the 'right' order for that song would be just that song many times in a row what i feel is, if you're gonna have 'concept' on an 'album', at least crank up the 'concept' until it's not an album anymore. if it's still an 'album' then i feel the concept wasn't strong enough. kind of like jet fuel melting steel beams. if the beams didn't melt, the jet fuel wasn't strong enough. etc."

(4 bars of 4/4, 4 bars of 3/4, 4 bars of 4/4, 4 bars of 3/4, 4 bars of 4/4, 4 bars of 3/4, 4 bars of 4/4, 4 bars of 3/4.) then increase the tempo by 1 click. only increase the tempo when you've gotten it 4 times in a row"

        "answer": "no this website was made as kind of a celebration of escaping the societal pressures of collaborating. so it almost doesn't feel quite right to include collaborative efforts here. what i would have wanted to do was record the arranging session and have clips turn up on the reality page. but i decided against it because i didn't want anyone to be distracted by having recordings going during the arrangement"

        "question": "what does the second number in a time signature mean",
        "answer": "what note is a beat. for example, 4/4 means the quarter note is 1 beat. the top number (first number) tells you how many beats per bar, and the bottom (second) number tells you what kind of note gets 1 beat. 7/8 would mean there are 7 beats per bar and an 8th note gets 1 beat. actually when it's 8th notes, usually it's a cheat because usually the real beat is on a larger note, for example 7/8 would more accurately be represented as 3.5/4, because usually 7/8 is felt with the quarter note getting the beat and it feels like 3 and a half beats per bar. and in 6/8, most of the time the dotted quarter note gets the beat so in that case it would be more accurately represented as 2/1.5. Also in some places in the world such as britain, the notes are not called 8th notes and quarter notes, so in that case this explanation would be rubbish"

The impact I may have on this world is what is worrying me, Unfortunately this has lead to me making multiple theories, which has wound up leading me into the human mind aand I don't know who to explain them to, as I think a regular and boring psychologist would just give me the basic answers.

        "question": "How can go about writing a chord progression in a specific key, then change chords chromatically, and then finally end up back the to original key. For example: Key: C Major Song starts in C Then in the bridge, it changes to different chords that are not the C Major scale. But then finally, at the end of the bridge, the song goes back to C Major. You know what I mean? I want to make it feel like chromatic chord changes are supposed to be there or \"relatated\" for lack of a better term. I don't want the changes to feel just random. The changes need to be motivated. I don't know if all of this makes sense to you but it's like the same concept of the Outro to Mt St Helens, where ended up back in the key if G.",
        "answer": "you'll have to play through the entire song up until that point and try every chord you know after that and see which one you like every song has slightly different meaning. the only way to know what means what in a song is to hear how the song goes for real it sounds like you are motivated to specifically change keys by a half step and then go back. so if you make it really obvious you are doing that, your motivation will be clearly recognizable. everyone will know that was your goal that wasn't a half step change, that was a minor 3rd change from Bb back to G. the reason it had ended up in Bb was NOT because i ever wanted to 'go up a minor third.' the bridge just goes where it goes. it's a getaway bridge. (actually even the lyrics are about getting away, at that point). and actually, according to the rest of the song, you would expect to pop back to G BEFORE the start of the verse, which is what it does the previous time. but it actually didn't seem to work there, so i ended up staying on Bb for the start of that verse. and then pivoting on 'crazy' back"

        "question": "you should be rich. not saying you are in my assumptions, but like you deserve to be rich. not so you can live in luxury. i dont even think youd be comfortable in luxury. No, you should have wealth in order to achieve full potetnial in anything you want to do. For example, the fact you dont live in a secluded decent size house that allows you to play your drums as loud and often as you want is absurd. you're a genius and deserve your own studio or anything you need to create. why haven't you tried heavier to progress in the game of capitalism?",
        "answer": "sometimes it can be bad luck. i think i had some experiences at an early age where i had access to tools that were well beyond my experience level. as a result i felt completely frozen and confused, and stayed that way until whatever such equipment fell out of availability to me. after that, seeing other people actually making good progress using professional equipment only made me feel sad and got me stressed out. it made me feel like i would never win the race to get ready. i'm very sensitive to any kind of 'gear hustle.' that dark scary feeling that somewhere in a slightly nicer neighborhood, there's people who have better access to better equipment who will always be a 'step above' somehow. always been very scared and sensitive to this because being with the 'in crowd' was never something i was capable of. what i was capable of was completely the opposite, and so i am terrified of the gear hustle because it makes me feel like i'm living in a world opposite to one i am meant to succeed in. but then when i discovered that creativity lives everywhere and in everything, that was what unlocked the secret to being able to think comfortably, without the stress of the gear hustle. everything i've ever accomplished was built around that. the upgrades have come very gradually and steadily, nearly unprovoked. and when they do occur, they are fully welcome and strong. kind of like an ice age"

        "question": "bill that may sound weird but do you have any tips on how to write down a melody without using sheet music but just a txt? something that includes the notes, whether they are going up or down, the rhythms, accents maybe, but without using traditional notation and generally not symbols (at least not many). not necessarily suitable for others to read, just for my reference. like what if i wanted to write down \"twinkle twinkle little star\" in the key of C. i thought of writing it down as (without including the tempo right now): TREBLE, C, 4/4: C(4)q-Cq+Gq+Gq|Aq-Aq_Gh|Fq-Fq_Eq-Eq|Dq-Dq_Ch so i'm using a dash when the pitch stays the same, a + when it ascends and an underscore when it descends. after the letter of the note i use q for quarter, h for half, i'd probably use h. for dotted half etc. but what would i do if i wanted to write staccato markings or slur notes together, or maybe write chords as well. i think as an idea it looked good at the beginning but i'm starting to see the impracticality of it",
        "answer": "i do have a system for this. if you want to really display 'enough' information, it's gonna be a lot of information. but i do it in 4 lines. (actually for the melody it's just 2 lines, notes and rhythm. but i usually have a nother line for lyric, and another line for chords). i was looking for an example on my phone but unfortunately all the examples are of songs that haven't been recorded yet, and as much as i would love to spoil a future song i'm not going to. but here is what it would look like for part of one of my songs, assuming i wrote this on a plane or something, which i did not, but this is whati would have done: and i /won't get mad about the /dream if you promise to be/lieve in me 12/3 5 4 3 2 1/v5 v3 ^3 /22 7 7 /7 1 v4 &a1 e & &a e 1 a e 3e a & 1 a & 6m7 _ 2m7 _ 1/5 _ 5sus4 _ 5 _ 2-7 chord rhyth: 1 (2)& _ _ 1 _ 3 _ 1 (2) & ok i actually included another line here for chord rhyth to make sure i got those anticipations. which i may or may not have done in real life because i may have figured out due to common sense that those are supposed to hit with the melody. ... But, basically as you can see, the melody line is numbers in the scale. there are no flats here but i would use b3, b7, etc if i needed those. slash marks there are just for extra redundant clarity, they mark the top of the bar. or in some cases i will use them at the half bar as well. those slashes are also something i always use in lyric sheets just for extra clarity. they don't specify the rhythm exactly, but they do provide some clarity as to where the top of the bar is. and the rhythm will be further clarified on the rhythm line. As for which octave the notes in, there is no exact formula, but it is generally assumed that the note will be the closest one. so 3 5 means the 5 is higher. and if when i'm writing it i feel like it won't be obvious, or if it's a big jump, i will use v or ^ to indicate the higher or lower octave. also a lot of times i use 8s or 9s, which can help to indicate the high 1 or 2. that of course would be a disaster beyond 9 because then it's 2 digit numbers and that would be a disaster. also i generally use spaces to approximate the rhythm (on the melody / lyric line), again this is not to exactly illustrate the rhythm, but at least it's a hint (the exact rhythm will be shown on the rhythm line.) when you first take a look at this notation having no memory of the idea weeks later, you need all the hints you can get. then for the rhythm line, i'm using the 1e&a2e&a3e&a4e&a system, and i only write where the melody is. and again i use spaces in between for clarity. occasionally it's necessary to put the down beat number in parentheses if there's a big space. for example 1 & ....i might wanna say 1 (2) & to be sure if it's the & of 2 and not the & of 3. and for the chord line, i generally may specify if there is a smallest subdivision, like \"chords every 2 beat\" ... or, if i say 'chords every 1 beat', then i have an underscore line _ which means no chord there. so if i say '1 chord per beat' and then say C _ F C G _ _ _, that actually means the first C is 2 beats, and the G is 4 beats. make sense? using the underline marks to keep the time consistant. this stuff is all just an amalgamation of different writing tricks i've used, and if at all possible, it's best to also jump on an audio memo and sing SOMETHING. Also it's good to provide any additional information you can, as hints. definitely say what tempo. also say what key, if you think you know a good key, or if you think you know what key you are hearing it in. also if you are on a phone doing this, which is usually where you will need this, autocorrect will kick your ass the entire time. good luck"

        "question": "can you please explain your schedule. everyone is referencing it but I don't know what it is",
        "answer": "making full blown audio visual content by yourself takes a frighteningly long time, especially if you want it to be relatively rich and good, and of a reasonable length. i used to do videos 5 days a week, but that was only possible with extremely short material. then i scaled back to 2 short videos a week, and then unscheduled i worked on 3 minute song-videos. to my dismay, the song-videos took a frighteningly long time. then i found success on 'vine' so it became a priority to do 7 extremely short videos per week, and there was pretty much no additional time leftover. since finding success on youtube and with longer material (longer than 6 seconds at least) i never wanted to go back to 6 seconds, because i made more than enough of that stuff to last 1000 lifetimes. but the problem is, i've been searching for a schedule that works with longer content, and i found it impossible to find one. 6 weeks seems unacceptable for one song-video. i might as well be dead. but i was already moving as fast as i thought possible. this is all i have thought about, every day, for the last 4 years or more. it's one of the defining issues of my life. some time in september 2017, i suddenly snapped and said \"2 weeks per video, that's it, just do it. 2 weeks. i don't care who you are. just do it.\" and the idea was to alternate between music video (song) and non-song video. this worked for the 1st video, soap tips (non-song) i finished that just barely inside of 2 weeks. but for the next video (song) i failed spectacularly. the fact is, it takes much much longer to make a 3 minute song+video than a 1 minute non-song video. any way you calculate it that's obviously true. especially if you are also producing a song that is supposed to be in tip-top shape. also added was the fact that i hadn't done a live action music video in about 2 years, so i was in a very very careful mindset. must have got like a trillion takes. that whole song+video took 14 weeks to make. as that one was being released, i promised myself once again that it MUST be 2 weeks per video. i resigned to not doing songs on that schedule, my plan was to do 'any' video every 2 weeks, and then 'in the background' work on song-videos. that of course is a death sentence to the song-videos, because even uninterrupted those things take massive amounts of weeks, so how would it ever get done quickly 'on the side.' so i succeeded at 2 consecutive non-songs, on a 2 week basis, then i suddenly decided it was time for another song, and i made a deadly serious promise that it would be done inside of 4 weeks. (feb 13 - mar 13) (i knew better than to ask for 2, that was just too insane.) i tried as hard as i could, and i didn't make it. once you hit an original proposed deadline and it's not done, it can be very devastating. much to my dismay, it took until april 25th to get it done, for a total of 11 weeks. during this time i should mention i felt i had very much to learn about audio mixing, and was determined to get better sounding mixes, so i was spending several days in the mix, also weeks in the arrangement, many days in vocals, and many many many days in the video. also learning new video techniques here as always. So at this point it's pretty much understood that my dreams are never going to come true with regard to the pace of music video releases. even at this stage i am frequently racing the clock, setting timers to push speed faster, and the total time for the project still remains many weeks long. the next one i completed in 8 weeks, which was a slight improvement, and the next one also in 8 weeks. then, this puts us at about September, 2018, suddenly i had another one of those panic lightning bolt moments of life-or-death determination. and i decide i'm gonna get this in 2 weeks or die trying. i don't know why this worked this time when i was so far off before, but it worked. many many things about the process changed. the writing changed, the arranging process changed, the vocal session changed drastically (for the better, in multiple ways) and the video session changed drastically. other changes too, in general, such as regimened morning walks to help kick off absolute peak productivity, which also serves as an escape moment to calm down because there is litterally no other time available on this time frame. so for some reason, i was magically able to sustain this 2-week stunt for 7 songs (with video included) in a row. it really seems like the best thing that's ever happened to me, it is reassuring, strengthening, revitalizing, ridiculously exciting, so good in so many ways. also completely and totally terrifying. the last 2 of those songs had their visual component nearly entirely made during the last 36 consecutive hours before release. in the christmas song, i recall screaming and having a total mental breakdown at 5pm on tuesday because i realized the 1st chorus sucks (visually) and i couldn't find a way to make it good. Anyway, something was starting to hit me, and it was the feeling that i need to integrate non-song videos into the schedule. but, being that the 2-week song release schedule was the best thing to ever happen to me, i was not going to give that up. so at this point (early december) i decided i should ADD another video (non-song) to the 2 week schedule, on the opposite week. so the 2 week song schedule would uninterrupted, but i would do a non-song additionally, in between. so essentially that means 1 video every week. If we stop and think about this, we can see that this is sheer greed right here, because about a year earlier, my 'dream schedule' was 2-weeks for a songvideo, and 2 weeks for a non-song, which back then was possible for non-songs but still wildly unattainable for songvideos. and NOW IT'S POSSIBLE as i proved 7 times in a row last fall. So essentially i am strong enough right now to actually do the dream schedule that was so sought after and unattainable last year. but instead, no, i insist on doubling it. here we see the greediness. december 2018, i failed at this, i attempted to do 'ball and stick' for tues dec 4 (the week in between the songs), and just couldn't get it done on time. then i frantically raced to try to still complete a song by the due date (dec 11), but it was chosen too quickly and on friday i noticed some serious problems with the choice, and had to abandon it, with nowhere near enough time to complete an entire song+music video in just 3 days. so in my greed to add non-song content to the 2 week schedule, i failed at the 2 week schedule. and ever since then i have been staggering along, injured and confused. for some reason, i still maintain that what i want is the 1+1 schedule (1 week per video, and alternating songvideo and nonsong). but that is very very very intense. i think the absolute quickest i've ever completed a songvideo might be about 10 days. of course also not helping the situation is the fact that after doing so many 2-week songs, i'm getting thirsty for a little more care and focus and new techniques. so i'm less willing to really make things suck. but for some reason i am still extremely attached to the 1 week schedule even though it is still quite a few steps over my head. oh well, i guess that's ambition"

        "question": "3.30.18 3:05 pm I am very much interested give me everything you got",
        "answer": "next you check for 3s. add up the digits, and if they add to a multiple of 3 then it's a multiple of 3. if the sum of the digits too high to know if it's a multiple of 3 then add those digits again and see if it's a multiple of 3. you surely already know about this so i will move on to the next part, which is the majority of the hard work. check systematically for each prime number. 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, on and on and on and on. there are many tricks i have learned, but the general strategy is, you transform your target number by a multiple of 7 to deliberately make it more recognizable (smaller). and once you get it simple enough to recognize if the resulting number is a multiple of 7 or not, then you know your original number was or was not a multiple of 7. here's an example or all the techniques listed so far, just to give you the idea. i'll pick a random 4 digit number, chosen from random.org, and it's 4588. first it's even so cut it in half. visually i can separate this into 4 58 8. (all even numbers) cut all those in half, 2 29 4. so 2294. still even. divide again, mentally do it like this: separate and then split each: 22 94. would be 11 47. (47x2 is 94, i just know that one). so 1147. now check 3. what i just did to check 3 is add 3, = 1150, drop the zero, then you can knock out '15' cuz that's a 3, and you're left with 1 which is not 3. so 3 is eliminated. 5 obviously gone too because it doesn't end in 5. now check 7. as i said before, we can transform by 7s until it's recognizable as mult of 7 or not. so actually look, i can ditch the 14 in the middle =1007 (almost like i just subtracted 140, which is obviously mult of 7 because 14 is). Ok, now i can ditch the 7. = 1000. =not a mult of 7. that's just something you should know about 1000000 or 100 or 1 or 10000000 doesn't matter how many zeros, those are made up of only 2s and 5s. ok so 7 is gone, not a part of 1147. next test, 11. easy. knock off the 11, =47. 47 clearly non11, it would have to be 44. so 11 is gone. checking 13 now. 1147, here's essentially the bread and butter technique: add 13, and that will allow you to knock off a zero. 1147+13 = 1160, drop the zero is 116. in half is 58. in half is 29. done (no 13, would have to be 26). The key to what i just did is that our 1147 number has already been divided by 2 all the way, and by 5 all the way. so this number has to be either 1 or 3 away from the nearest 10. and all the remaining primes we have to check are between 1 and 3 away from 10. so there is always an option to add or subtract from the current target number (1147 in this case) to get it to be a mult of 10, and then you can drop the zero. and if it doesn't work you can triple the prime you're testing. this is the main strategy, it's like working from the right side of the number. but there is another basic strategy too which is to go from the left. ok so 13 is gone, next is 17. clearly just subtract it, = 1130, drop zero is 113, now add 17 is 130, drop zero is 13. NOT 17. so 17 is gone. NEXT is 19. so looking at 1147, my options are either to subtract triple 19 or do something else. i happen to know triple 19 is 57, that's reasonably easy to subtract from 1147, it's 1090, or 109. prime (i already know that, the first decade of the 100s is a full prime decade, 4 primes). But let's say you didn't want to subtract 57 from 1147, too much of a headache, and honestly it kind of is. so you could actually zap 114 off the left, because 114 is a multiple of 19, if you happen to know that. then you're left with 7 which is of course non-19. Ok, next prime to check, and BY THE WAY, when doing this, if you're checking in order, the good news is you only have to go as far as the square root of the target number you're working with. so as long as i've checked every prime in order, i don't have to go any further than the square root of 1147. what is the square root of 1147? well let's see, the square root of 900 is 30, and the square root of 1600 is 40. so the square root of 1147 must be in the low 30s. so we definitely will not have to check 37 as long as we have checked all the primes up until there by the time we get there. the reason why is because if you've exhausted all previous primes, and then you find 37 goes into 1147, it's like, 37 times what?? a lower prime? impossible, because you've checked them all. so we only have to check up to 31. so the next test was 23. easy, 1147 + 23 = 1170. drop zero, 117, again easy, plus 23 is 140. drop zero, 14, that's just 7. non23. next test is 29. here's where the tricks become nifty. you can triple and it's 87, if you're in the mood to subtract 87 from 1147, but i say no thanks. i have a nice trick for 29, it's 203. (203 is a multiple of 29.) so that is very easy for this situation. 1147 + 203 is 1350. drop zero is 135. divide by 5, an easy way to divide by 5 is double it = 270 and drop the zero. 27. that is not 29. ok so next test and the only test left is 31. so you could triple it to 93, and add 1147+93 which is not so hard, but in case you are not in the mood to do that, i have a neat trick for 31 which is 403 (a multiple of 31). 1147 plus 403 is 1550, drop zero is 155, double it is 310 HOLY CRAP, A SOLUTION SHOWED ITSELF AT THE LAST MINUTE that was actually a particularly thrilling one, even though i chose it randomly. so you drop the zero and it's 31, so we've just reached 31 by transforming 1147 by multiples of 31, so we know that 1147 is a multiple of 31. and we know the partner for that has to be 37 because it has to end in 7 because of the last digit, and 47 would be too big. but let's just check, ... 111 i happen to know is 37 x 3, and then add a zero is 1110 plus 1 more 37 is 1147, so it's confirmed. So now if you want the real prime factorization of the Original number (4588) you just have to re-trace your steps for those initial divisions we did, mostly 2s if i remember ....2294, 4588. yes, that's 4x. so the complete prime factorization would be 2 x 2 x 31 x 37 = 4588. and the extra surprise is remember that ridiculously long queue you were waiting in, well surprise you're almost to the front of it, and you didn't even have to get nerd neck in the process"

        "question": "Why did the new song come out a whole 20 days after it was supposed to? What happened?",
        "answer": "let's see .... the previous video was released on tues 2/12. so, nowadays, the ultimate dream goal is to get it done inside of 1 week. this is really not yet physically possible, i've never beat 10 days, with a full songvideo. but still keep trying because i'm, stupid? wed 2/13 i organized a huge amount of new sounds, which would be very important to the next song. thu 2/14 was general songwriting/ songgen (generating new songwriting ideas, generally writing on middle ideas, etc.). Fri 2/15 final selection for next song (it was just a verse melody at that point), and wrote entire song until the end. (that's well on target, that's essentially the fastest is 1 day. even some of the 2-week projects had their song written in 3 days.). Still weirdly praying that i might be on time for 1 week sched. truthfully the instruments organizing set me back a day. that's not a normal occurance, it was a serious quantity of new instruments. a lot to search through. Anyway, very quick temp insts (for vocs to sing over) and then immediately all vocals, lead and backup, the entire day Sat 2/16. this is the standard quickest time, before the 2 week schedule it would be many days. Ok, so what happens next (had to check the records here) this is what happened, going into sunday. This already would have been the most insanely tight sched, to be able to finish an entire music video by the following tuesday (?????), but the way it happened, i had been up very late songwriting, leading into Friday morning (when i did vocals) and i needed to wake up quite early on Friday to get vocals (the entire day time is just barely enough to get all vocals for 1 song, especially with mostly full harmonies for the majority of the song). So the plan was was to go straight to sleep at the end of that vocal day, and i would need it, because of so little sleep just before the vocal day. I actually got into bed and litterally could not fall asleep. was lying there for about 6 hours. this is unusual, usually i don't even bother getting into bed if i'm not tired, but this time it was not only essential for the schedule, but also it should have worked! i was on barely any sleep from the night before, so i thought it had to work. but, i essentially got my ass kicked for the 20th time by circadia. basically that means, (and i think i've finally learned my lesson now) Even if you slept way way too little the night before, and are lacking on sleep, you STILL might not be able to fall asleep until pretty much the same time you went to bed previously. If i had known this retrospectively, i would have simply jumped right into the music (instrumental) arrangement, which CAN happen at night. i just didn't expect that to be the right move, because of the lack of sleep from before the vocal. So you might look at it and say that moment was what the initial failure of a potential 1-week delivery hinged upon. So once i actually fell asleep around 6am, i was gone, for more than a full night's (day's) sleep. That was the point the 1-week was completely gone, but that's not really fair to say that because the 1-week is so freakin tight squeeze that that surely wasn't the 'only' thing that would have gone wrong. as it is, the 1-week relies on essentially doubling my best time (cutting the time in half) of every phase of the project. (do everything at least twice as fast as my absolute fastest time). So anyway, that Sunday (actually more like the overnight into monday morning) is a significant moment of loss, because tuesday was lost. What typically happens when you reach this point is, the exhaustion from the previous days tends to hit, because the endorphins from the excitement about that date (Tues 2/19 in this case) are lost, so there is kind of a forced rest (exhaustion). Seems i spent the whole day (which at this point is mostly the overnight going into Monday morning) working on reality edits. not such a bad deal, that's a project that is chronically behind and has been forever. the following day, (Tues, on the early side), it seems i was looking to develop other projects that constantly get left behind, one of which was a the idea of doing a basic recorded music arrangement and sing/play keyboard with it live. not to actually perform publicly with, but to work the arrangements out, and then hopefully result in a smooth hand off to a real band arrangement somewhere down the line. Tried it on some cover songs, but quickly got 'uselessitis', which always inevitably tends to happen when you are 'experimenting' on something without actually knowing specifically what the project is and when/how it's due. This jolt typically sends me back to the linear schedule, with a new set of ambitious dates to go for, because the conclusion is always that when left alone to freefloat, every project evaporates badly. So i think that's generally the idea here, and it is likely i spent way too long on questions that day. Also during this day i was deeply studying my own procedures, particularly during the 2-week song schedule, to really study the time it took for each bit, desperately searching for somewhere to shave additional time off somewhere. the general conclusion i had been operating with was that 'arrangement AND mix' (that's the entire instrumental arrangent AND the final mix) needed to be done in 1 day in order for me to even have a shred of time for the video. like the whole schedule was mapped out as tightly as possible, and it all seemed to hinge upon 1 of 3 impossibles being true: \"day 0\" doesn't exist, \"arr+mix\" in 1 day and not even a 24 hour day (must be 12 only), or, entire visual video done in \"the monday slam\" which is where the entire visual is made between approximately 10am monday and 4pm tuesday, without sleeping. (this was pretty much accomplished only once, and it is not a pretty sight. in fact mostly on the 2 week schedule, this final slam is mandatory, but only once was the entire visual started on monday morning, and that was only a 2 minute song. in another case i did the final 3 minutes on the monday morning slam). the monday morning slam is not pretty, and any reasonable health professional would certainly advise me never to do that again. So i basically had the 1 week schedule hinging upon either A) no day 'zero', B) arr+mix in 1 day, or C)'monday slam required.' Just to fill you in on these other options briefly, 'day zero' consists of: write and schedule all tweets for 7 days, get anagrams done for 7 days, MAKE A REALITY VID (thanks to new release schedule which i don't intend on breaking) and 'generalized songwriting' (new ideas, development on ideas, before selecting next proj, in order to strengthen what we have to select from of course, without songgen the list would eventually be empty)... and god forbid, 'chill.' Those are all things that go into 'day zero.' So again, if day zero is allowed, and if you want 2 actual days for visual, and if you write the entire song in 1 day, and do all the vocals in 1 day, (these are generally assumed maxed out in terms of the best i can do), then that allows only ONE DAY for the ENTIRE arr+mix. What i'm trying to say is, the absolute best i've ever done on arr+mix is total something like 3 days. Anyway, that is what i was studying on Tue 2/19, was arr+mix total times, during the 2 week schedule, trying to figure out if i had ever been anywhere close to 12 hours. Because that was essentially the concession that would need to be made. And i think my conclusion was that it's highly unlikely but it's worth a shot. So then, it appears Wed 2/20 is now day zero, looks like i wrote all the tweets. Tweet writing can be a monster, if you wanna get a week's worth, it can really take a while to get it, especially after thousands of tweets and refusing to actually repeat tweets. Ok, so Thu 2/21 looks like we're moving full ahead on the inst arrangement. keep in mind, the only way to have a chance at the magic '1 week' thing is if i can suddenly do the arr. AND mix, to completion, in less than 1 normal length day. ridiculous. even on the most insane crunches during the 2 week (slow down, st helens, most of them actually) it was like, if i power through mercilessly for a long day, i can maybe get it to mostly near the end on a 1st round arrangement, and then the second day i'll pick where i left off, then back to the beginning second round arr. / adjust, fix/improve, (called \"arr2\") which takes much less time than arr 1, and then if i push into 24 hour marathon for that day i can arrive at the final mix. that's the absolute best i've ever done for \"arr+mix\", like something like 3 days pretty much. So yea, am i magically get that all to fit in 12 hours? no. Using almost entirely brand new instruments is not quite speeding things up, feeds the obsessive meticulousness. After 3 days the arr. is finally done. Not entirely sure what the sleep schedule looks like around this point, a quote from Sun 2/24 4:26 am, is \"getting angry and desperate\", still all i can think about is the 1-week, and yet 2-weeks is suddenly blown, because you can't be not done with the mix on Sunday. my absolute world record for this may have had the mix finished as late as sunday morning. and then an ultra slammer from monday morning straight through (not healthy, nor possible). Somewhere around this time, got hooked on Alex Honnold climbing videos, and general wisdom from Alex Honnold, the main thing i took from that can be summarized in a clip i posted here yesterday, so at least that had some value. Essentially focusing that on the 1-week schedule. Unfortunately 2-weeks is now blown, as i said, which can happen if you focus too intently on the 1. this is my life these days. But anyway, the final mix, it appears, was reached Sun 2/24 at 2:22 am. (minus car test, no car test, and i don't really care that much because it sounds great on the leading brand of earbuds, which is my main reference anyway.) So racing forward of course, Mon 2/25 is recording all video footage (gonna be a live action vid, for sure). Getting everything for voc, and every instrument. With this one i really thoroughly went throuh the whole thing getting everything i need for all instruments. then clip selecting (going through all of it), then import and full sync of all vocal bits and significant inst fills, assembled into full rough cut which appears to be completed tue 2/26 6:31pm. So this is crossing the 2 week point, so a lot of confidence will inevitably be lost at this point. because, a little history, my best time for these projects was 8 weeks, absolutely couldn't do better than that, for a long time, until i entered panic mode in sept 2018 and suddenly did them in 2 weeks each, that was psycho mode. And it was going steadily until i started wanting to add more, and it has failed ever since, as a result of obsessively aiming for 1 week. So when we cross over 2 weeks, it becomes a little 'what the hell is going on.' The other important element here is that there is a guest appearance on a Scary Pockets session video, scheduled in L.A. on sunday 3/3, and i've scheduled a week long trip to visit family, on another continent entirely, immediately after that. I think my plan at the point of 2/26 was to finish the music video AND fit in another very short video before leaving, also. But looking at the records, i'm embarassed to say not much was accomplished for the next few days. To be fair and humane, i suppose i should admit that when you spend long hours constantly working every single day, there reaches a point where you just can't lift a finger for a few days. it seems i was watching a lot of quentin tarantino interviews during these few days (i've never seen his movies, just the interviews). Very uncomfortable several days, i recall really feeling like i couldn't figure out how to get it together. still just wishing for that 1 week schedule, and still feeling like it's so far out of reach. To actually let the music video go unfinished before leaving the country seemed completely unthinkable, but at the same time i was feeling completely torn and shredded from constantly failing this 1 week thing (AND 2 week, it's been a similar stagger of repeated failures ever since early december). So, one way or another, i decided it was actually better to do the unthinkable, and let it slide, get out of town, and then have a better chance at a fresh start and hitting that fresh 1 week ambition 1 more time from the start. because i've been trying to get this 1 week thing since december and just can't seem to let go of it. So the trip was good, gave me a chance to figure some things out (maybe ... or is it just the same thing as always? wish i could do the impossible, think i still can, really excited to try again, oblivious to past failures). Somewhere on about mar 7, on an epic 4 hour walk from somewhere from East Croydon, i got the typical maximum jolt of excitement and determination to absolutely get the 1 week schedule, starting from my return Sat 3/8, finishing current video for immediate tuesday, and then absolutely jump to 1 week from there. Finished entire 'day zero' (just tweets and ans really, for this time) on the plane (cept for reality video, which i already had ready from weeks ago) and was more ready than ever. From then, upon returning home, i did very well. Completely full days of work, maxed out hustling, all devices set to airplane mode, etc. Still required monday push (awake from mid-monday all the way until tuesday evening). Essentially was half way through first round of graphics on monday afternoon, and just started crashing, very early on in that day. Not just because of the 'time crunch,' but really i was just suddenly so insanely sick of all my existing video techniques, and just being really worn down from the quality sacrifices i had had to make with speed-production in general, ever since the 2 week schedule. hit a very low point, really felt unable to find new exciting ways of doing things. but actually because of that low, i was able to pull through within a couple of hours and have some very deep breakthroughs, with regard to technique, ideas, etc. Actually revitalizing most of my strong points in video making, etc. Really had some great breakthroughs, ... made it to the end by about 6am, rendered up and turned back around to beginning, still needing a hefty second round, because part of the breakthrough was not attempting so much to try to get it all there in 1 round, because in order to achieve graphic density you have to first work entirely devoid of graphic density, to free up your mind to get more precise with the motions, which i discerned was something that's probably been lacking for the past i dunno year of videos for me (and that's a strong point so it's important to reclaim that) ... anyway, did very well in the first verse (second round), got it all set, and then just looked at that 'somewhere else instead' screen, which at the time was much more plain than it is now, looked at the time, it was like maybe 11am, and realizing there are still huge chunks of this video that are just pure blandness ..... already having been well beyond delerium over the course of the night (was awake for about 24 hours at this point) and sadly, despite a quite awesome push during the previous 3 days, had to give up. It was just too high a risk that it would have been total crap AND nearly destroyed myself physically (similar to the final push on many of the 2-week projects last fall.) The good news in this case, was i felt i had already had the more significant crisis-breakthrough the previous afternoon (Monday). so whatever. peaceful failure. Yet still again, plunged into mystery as to what the 'plan' is. And of course a bit of exhaustion from past 4 days of constant push. tweet writing needs to be done, pretty much wed 3/13 is tweet writing. Again, as usual, taking this time to regroup and also intensely study the 1-week plan, searching in different ways for possible ways to reconstruct it and shave off time. this time i've learned my lesson about arr+mix in 12 hours being out of the question, so instead i'm looking at condensing known 1-day entities, where the best time has been 1 day, yet i've achieved that repeatably, and looking to condense those to half a day. with that, it can become more like arr+mix has 2 days, and vid actually may have 3. so those are the kinds of things that are in the latest compromise. (keep in mind, the 1-week idea is still wildly on mars, but i never stop going for it. i just can't stop fixating on it). Spent too much time on questions for sure, wednesday into thursday, and then strange timing because suddenly a magazine interview i did is in the draft stage and i'm supposed to approve it (thank goodness i have final approval) .... it actually needed quite a bit of fixing, and material needed to be added, so i had to go digging through the questions archives, and perfectionism kicked in, so i spent quite a bit of time searching for better material for that, and the time was tight on that because it was supposed to be sent to print within a day or so after that. had to be awake for a strange time for extra phone call with magazine editor due to strange timezone difference, then actually that same day i had an appointment for car maintanence in an unusual location. so the whole thing strung together into a long day of not work, which to be honest is what i needed at that point. Friday 3/15 am fully back at it, pushing round 2 of graphics, and not particularly being in the mood to have this thing suck, because i'm tired of sucking and we've already been in this one for 4+weeks at this point. Tried my best to get it done 'several days before tues 3/19' because the idea is that we're gonna still go for 1 week on the next one, and it is so outrageous that i probably need a head start in order to have any flying chance. But essentially, for Sat, and Sun, i basically simply maxed out after a 12 hour work day. Would have been nice to make a real 'last minute push' and just zip it up for Saturday or something, but i was just simply topping out after 12 hours each day. like, can't do it anymore, let me go, do questions, sleep, whatever. And to be fair, any reasonable doctor would say you just can't make it a regular habbit to slam yourself silly. So, unfortunately, it was ordinary length work days (like 8 to 12 hours) at a relatively average pace, and it didn't get done until monday, ... actually as of waking up around 3pm monday it still wasn't done and i had actually thought i had resigned myself for tuesday. But somewhere around 3:30 pm i just told myself to 'shut, the, fuck, up' and stop worrying about details and just get the damn thing for release on monday, and whipped together the final corrections within an hour or so and got it set for monday. Might actually fit better with the first verse line anyway. So that's how it happened. and now my 'head start' on the 1-week has been whittled down to 1 day. now the key is to not spend that entire day documenting the entire previous production period."

Nowadays, I have a nice job which lets me buy stuff like a real analog synth and a $200 midi keyboard, but all the new capabilities means I'm now a total novice in figuring out how to use my tools to get the sound I want, and my nice job means I have very little time/motivation to build up that expertise - so my music is less frequent and less inspired, even though I have better gear. IMO, unless your skill level reaches the point where you're limited by your tools, nicer gear (with some exceptions - learning to play on a crappy instrument comes to mind) is almost more like a music-related hobby than a real aid to the music creation process.",

        "question": "your advice when trying to learn how to do stuff is to make a lot of very small things to improve your skills. and this works for me for videos and for programming. but this absolutely does not work for me for music. every time i try to make a song that's less than 1:30 i am overcome with feelings of uselessness and suck. really i can only think of one song i like that is shorter than a minute, and that is an album intro song and probably should have been longer than a minute too. pretty much every idea i have for a (lyrical) song either sucks or begs to be in the 1:30-3:30 range. so i keep making medium length songs (~3 minutes) and my skills are very mediocre so they all take a long time and come out mediocre. i would like to improve much faster but do not want to make short things (or make things short) just to get them done. are there any alternative solutions to this",

        "question": "what's the context/story behind jazz starbucks?",
        "answer": "i've always been extremely proficient in reading rhythmic notation, because drums was my main instrument for most of my childhood. but i never really spent any time on reading pitched notation. i've played with many small jazz groups where they play standards off a lead sheet, maybe even sight reading it, and it sounds like a tune, just right off the page. i began to be really jealous of this, and i figured i was probably almost there. because i had already been using notation to write my own songs in the library, writing easily pretty much as fast as i could move the pencil. so i knew i was pretty close to having it altogether where i could sight read a lead sheet melody, but i felt like i never really put in the solid time to practice. so i started doing tunes out of a realbook, almost like pretending i was a small jazz ensemble, doing tunes i had never heard before. recording the tracks 1 part at a time, usually just drums, bass, chord, and lead. often i would take the tempo quite slow. i think i started with 'central park west' and then moved on from there. then fast forward about a year, i was scrambling through different possibilities of making videos, audio/visual content, etc, and thinking about preparing to get 'online', .... and some very simple experimental ideas came up, such as taking one of those jazz recordings and putting some kind of video on it. the jazz starbucks video would be an example of that. also there is one for the song 'tune up' where the video simply scrolls through the apps on my dock. i didn't do too many more videos like that, because, well, they're stupid"
