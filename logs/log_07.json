        "answer": "you could try all caps. that quote in all caps seems pretty solid to me. probably better than the lower case version. i've been saying it for years, and i think it's some kind of inside joke with myself and honestly i don't even get it"

        "question": "Many years ago I had fun memorizing a couple hundred digits of pi. I used 5-digit groups for the first hundred, but after that I found it was better to use variable-length groups -- easier to make up a story around them, harder to mix up the order, and so on. What's weird if I memorized them in my native language, which is not English, and it's really hard for me to recite the decimals in English. I have to pronounce them in my native language and translate the digits into English on the fly, which is hard to do at the same time. I memorized the sounds of the numbers, not the numbers themselves. I never decided to do that, it's just how I naturally did it. I wonder if other people memorized the shapes instead, and would have an easier time saying them in a different language by just visualizing the numbers instead of having to pronounce them internally. I'm not a musician but I'm curious as to how you learn a song. Probably you don't ju st recall the specific notes or chords, but some higher-order pattern? Is this something you can explain in simple words?",
        "answer": "as long as i've heard a song more than 10 or 20 times, over the course of a few days, i automatically learn it and could not unlearn it. but the tricky part is if i have to learn (memorize) a song on short notice. for that, i absolutely just make a chart and then read it. i am pretty much bullet proof that way, in that case i would only have to hear a song once, i just write it down the first time. but in the rare case the director may say 'absolutely no reading' .... well ........ i'd be fucked. until the age of A.R. glasses"

Update: i have waited 1,000 years and it's still noise city right. but, .... i am working with the absolute fastest computer on the market for my operating system, and there is still significant wait time just to even see what i'm working on. working blind is something i've just decided i'm not willing to do anymore. Additionally, .... i drew up a fairly simple scene (1 image! not even a video) with some lights and reflections, .... i set the sample# to 1000. waited quite awhile, and after all 1000 samples ..... still an absurdly high quantity of noise. not even close to being noise free. and still significant wait time. for ONE frame. a video contains at least 30 frames per second (and i would strongly prefer 60). yes eevee is frustrating and wacko when it comes to reflections and transparencies, and i still need serious help with it, but when all the factors are considered for Cycles, it's just no after no after no after no. If there is a computer in existence that can do Cycles renders instantaneously, i will spend my entire life savings on it. but i am under the impression that it is not there. The good news is, when put into perspective, Eevee is absolute lightyears ahead of where i've been before"

        "question": "just one more thing about cycles!!! same person from before or whatever. It can be rendered overnight like a few hundred frames if you set it to 64 samples and then use the new 2.81 expiremental build. It has a denoising Ai engine from intel that does some absolute magic. See Cgmatter's youtube page for tutorial. But you just render an image and plug it into the denoise node in the composite space and then render and its removes the noise. Eevee still is definitely the way to go and there are plenty of other more important things to learn but i just tried this recently and it really is quite spectacular looking imo so its just something to remember",

        "question": "i really enjoy the sensation of rolling up an earplug into a tight little spike, pushing it deep into my ear, and letting it expand so it puts pressure on my deep inner ear canal. it feels so good that it almost feels like a trance. but i can't find any info on whether this is bad for me long term, do you happen to know? i have dry (asian) type earwax, not wet (white ppl) type earwax, if that makes a difference",
        "answer": "that is generally the right way to do it, but please make sure you don't push it TOO far. it is important to roll it so it goes in well enough not to fall out, and also what i do is i reach over my head with the opposite hand and pull the ear up, before putting it in. but you must be careful not to go any further than you need to"

        "question": "hi bill when i open the scarmble page on chrome on my laptop, my entire computer becomes insanely slow until i close the scarmble page and i was just wondering if that's possibly the computer's fault or maybe if the page is causing it.. because from what i have heard, people tend to have the same issue on their chrome android with the ueqstions page.... so i was just wondering",
        "answer": "i am going to page-ify it soon (put it on multiple pages) but i would like to hear as much info as possible, from different people using different devices. it's just text, and it still works fine for me (not chrome) and i will absolutely page-ify it as soon as possible, similar to the way it works on the questions page. Actually, i've made a test version here which is only 2500 lines. the regular version (about 7000 lines) is here. would be curious to hear what your experience is on both pages, if the long one still works ok, if the short one is any better, and what device/browser you are using"

        "question": "11.22.19 7:17 pm whoa no way! i have always heard that one as a waltz... just blew my own mind by listening to it in 12/8 (which was mostly successful with a conscious effort, i am pleased to report) i think because the vocals so strongly imply a slower 3, i would have needed a 12/8 groove for a few bars before the verse, otherwise the count-in just gets recontextualised in my brain as \"interesting weird rhythm\" having said that i just tested it on my sister and she got the 12/8 straight away so maybe my brain is just weird. this makes me want to do a survey",

        "question": "So I feel I may have lost my ability to talk to people. I feel like because of me, my relationships that I built this year are destined to fall apart. I feel like everyone around me wants to attack me or something. I know it's bull but I just keep thinking it. Any advice? Also how are you?",
        "answer": "what always works for me in those situations is to start expressing myself in any way possible, whether it's written text, improvised music, or spoken words, even just discussing and anlyzing the situation. that's just because stirring up mental energy is the main way that i function and feel alive. it also gives me a lot of extra comfort to also know that i am documenting those expressions as a souvenir of the struggle. for me, that always works. i often recommend the same thing to other people, but actually i just realized that maybe not everyone else is exactly the same as me"

        "question": "Okay, here's my situation.... I have been on a bonkers schedule for a little under a year, and in that time I have conquered a considerable chunk of the observable universe thanks to the schedule. It really drags you along and makes you get things done. But I'm thinking of going off the schedule, partially because I just rediscovered the unobservable universe and really wanna go crazy and do something different in there. On one hand, this is exciting beyond the belief. Dropping the schedule feels like freedom. (I'm also pretty tired from making content daily, so I love the idea of a change of pace.) On the other hand, I haven't been off-schedule in a long time, and the schedule itself gave me the initial jolt of energy I needed to get going, so I fear the lack of direction/motivation that (sometimes) comes from having no schedule. You've done all sorts of schedules and non-schedules... any advice?",
        "answer": "i received a very genuine and profound honest answer to that question from a stranger on an extremely short elevator ride. i barely had time to explain the problem (exactly the same situation you explained above) because the elevator ride was so short. but as we arrived at his floor, i said \"which one is it? what's the answer?\". there was just enough time before the doors closed for him to decisevely inform me, \"i think you need both.\" this was profound to me, but admittedly a clear 3rd answer is still needed"

        "question": "You responded to a question about tuning systems a while back. The asker wanted to know if you'd ever tried tuning completely in just intonation. You said it's a noble endeavor, but ultimately it's impossible; you couldn't even get a full major scale out of the harmonic series, much less a working system of chromatic harmony. I've realized something which could go a long way towards solving this problem - I've even composed/arranged some nice music using this concept. (It is by no means my original idea, btw.) Your problem was that you tried to create a major scale (C major, if I recall) in which each scale degree was only tuned one way, regardless of its 'function'. For example, F would always be the same pitch, whether it was the 3rd of a D minor chord or the 7th of a G7 chord. The way I started thinking about just intonation tuning is this: all harmony diatonic to C major can be derived from the harmonic serie s of Bb (minus 4\u0e02, because C, in this case, is defined as the 9th harmonic of Bb). In the C overtone series, we can get a very nice version of the C major triad (1st, 3rd, and 5th harmonics), the G major triad (3rd, 9th, and 15th harmonics), the E minor triad (3rd, 5th, and 15th harmonics), and the B diminished triad (15th, 9th, and 21st harmonics). In order to get the three remaining triads, you need to use some 'undertones' of C - notes for which C is an overtone. I thought about it like this - if we get C major and E minor triads from the C harmonic series - we can just transpose down a (harmonic) perfect fifth to get F major and A minor triads. Then we can transpose down another perfect fifth to get the D minor triad (3rd, 5th, and 15th harmonics of Bb). Since F-2\u0e02 and C are both overtones in the Bb-4\u0e02 harmonic series, and since each overtone has a harmonic series of its own (which is still part of the original harmonic series), we can say that a ll harmo ny diatonic to C major can come from the Bb-4\u0e02 overtone series and sound great. However, to sound good, notes need to be tuned differently depending on what member they are in a chord. For example, the D minor triad in C sounds great on its own when tuned as the 3rd, 5th, and 15th harmonics of Bb-4\u0e02. But the D minor triad can also be found within a G9 chord. In this case, a different tuning will be way more consonant - as the 3rd, 7th, and 9th harmonics of G+2\u0e02 (which is the 3rd harmonic of C and the 27th harmonic of Bb-4\u0e02). If I remember correctly, this is how you tried to tune a D minor triad a while back - it sounds consonant in the context of a G9 chord, but not in the normal context of a D minor chord. I realize this is not so practical for live keyboard or fretted instruments, but it's been great for retuning recorded music or composing in a DAW. Thoughts?",
        "answer": "it probably doesn't help that i've never seen this symbol before: \u0e02, but essentially, what i discovered boils down to this, speaking in the key of C: the very nature of notes like D, F, G, and A, ... when all used together.... those all need to have certain relationships to each other simultaneously, which is actually impossible. the only way this 'secondary' chord seems to want to work is when it actually feels like all these relationships are true: the F and D have to have a good relationship, the F and A have to have a good relationship, the D and G have to have a good relationship, and the F and C, ... and the G and C, ...... and what i came to discover was that it's actually this subtlely impossible nature that gives this chord such a longing need to go back 'home' to the 1 chord. kind of blew my mind. i explained all of this as well as i ever possibly could, right here, and like i said, it gave me a deeper appreciation and validation for the 12 tone equal temperment system than i ever thought possible, and i have never questioned it since"

I was wondering well how could i achieve that upwards acceleration, counteract gravity and then some. I thiugh of spaceships but that requires fuel. But rubber ducking to you now i realize perhaps some sort of bernoulli effect but i think i cant have bernoulli effect when the incoming wind is in the desired lift vector.

However, I am in a cognitive science class, and it is teaching me that analogy is fairly specific to humans, and it might be what has allowed us to advance beyond other species.

I also am trying to write lyrics for the whole song (on the subject of loneliness and isolation coz thats the concept of the album) and am struggling with that too. do you have any advice for overcoming my musical and poetic writers block or any avenues i could explore that i havent already?",
        "answer": "although i know the meaning of all the terms you used, still the funny thing about music is there is still no way for me to actually have any idea how your song actually goes. what i might dare to recommend, and i recommend this all too often because it has worked very well for me, is try to write much shorter songs so you can more quickly learn the possibilities. even just the amount of time you've spent giving a verbal description of the song, is enough time to lose momentum of the process. need to go much quicker, more carefree. and for now try shorter songs so you can explore the entire process faster and get more of an idea of what the possibilities can be. and beware that trying to explain a song to someone who hasn't heard it, very often kills it"

        "question": "hey, just curious if you remember what it was like transitioning into writing the roadmap for songs before you record them, assuming you did it a different way before. like how did you learn?",
        "answer": "not really a transition.... i've tried both, and when i don't write it first, it just doesn't have the freedom to go where it wants to go. As i'm saying this now, i can see that it appears backwards, but the reason is because when you're recording a song there are lot of instruments and parts to deal with, so you can't very easily change the way the song goes, on a whim. I've found that it's a much greater advantage when you write the song before anything is recorded, because you can make the song go anywhere, on a whim. you just write it there and it goes there. in other words, writing is not like writing multiple instruments. i don't write the instruments, i write the *song*. which consists of melody+lyric+chords, all the way through, and knowing the exact tempo. The process of translating that into instruments only happens once the song is written. it's probably a lot like animating a cartoon. it's pretty hard to improvise a cartoon. you kind of have to know how it goes before you do it. you CAN however, improvise a cartoon by acting it out, improvised. then based on the recorded improv, make the cartoon. similarly, a song could be made by improvising it using 1 instrument and voice, and then constructing the arrangement based on that recording. i forgot the question"

I guess my question is how do I make the most of the new decade?",

        "answer": "you suggested for me NOT to \"withhold\" the name of the game, and withhold means to not reveal it, so it sounded like you were saying that i should not hide the name of the game, but in the context i determined it was more likely you meant that i SHOULD withhold it (not display it) i.e. not DISCLOSE it. so using my best judgement i censored the name because i wouldn't want to mess that up for you. and if you are wondering whether i am vastly and sickeningly excited about every kind of content in the entire galaxy, the answer is yes i am"

        "question": "how would you call this chord? G-Bb-Db-F i'd write it as Gdim7, cause you have the G diminished chord and you're adding the minor 7th. however, for some reason ingrained in tradition, Gdim7 usually means G-Bb-Db-E, while i think the chord i want would be called Gm7-5 or something. this is one of those cases where i just want to ditch the established names and just go with what makes most sense to me, but i'd like to be able to understand when other people write music too.",
        "answer": "depends where the bass is right yes, in some communities it is called that. elsewhere it tends to be called \"G half diminished\" which is written with a symbol similar to the diminished symbol (small circle) but with a slash through the circle i would recommend calling it Gm7b5 or G half diminished. i suppose the reason it's called half diminished is because the 5th is diminished and the 7th is not. i think in the traditional view, for major/minor intervals, 'diminished' actually means an additional halfstep flat. so a diminished 7th actually technically is the same notes as a major 6th. none of this is really important unless you like it"

        "answer": "the most important thing is this: the keyboard needs to know how loud you pressed the note. Some extremely extremely toy keyboards actually cannot tell the difference between a loud and a soft note, so all the notes sound the same volume. this means that you will sound like a beginner forever, even if you are good. so at the bare minimum, you must get a keyboard that knows the difference between a loud and a soft note. this is called \"dynamic sensitive\". a simple way to test this is: press a note very quietly, and then press it very loud. see if there is actually a difference in volume. i promise you, if you get a keyboard that does not have dynamic sensitivity, you will sound like a beginner for the rest of your life and not know why"

I feel like the words in those songs doesn't matter (which is a bit sad for me). I came to this conclusion after hearing the radio lol. What do you think?",
        "answer": "that's legit. the lyric-music convergence is extremely important and has a huge huge amount of power, but, still at the same time, it is possible for the music to still have an effect even if the lyrics are about something unimportant to you. i guess that's just how strong the hypnotic power of music/language is. it can actually be used to have meanings you may not have expected. it is also possible to exploit this deliberately"

I have found your video diaries in the reality section of this site really helpful, but I was hoping you could answer two questions. Thank you for everything you do. Here goes: 1. Your music has been described as jazz-pop. In your opinion, is that a fitting description for your work or would you prefer a different term or no term at all? 2. Have your writing methods changed over the years? If so, how?",
        "answer": "categorizing music into genres reminds me of categorizing people into races. it causes me to feel strange and uncomfortable music is such a strangely powerful thing, capable of such wonder and mischief, that if anyone tries to pin it down or label it, i would have every expectation that the music will find means to thwart that label with great excitement. it happens again and again and again, and this is probably the most important quality that music has, or any art in general. or the conscious human mind in general. surprise me yes i used to only know how to write totally in order (beginning to end), and in the same exact session as when i started it. nowadays, i not only know how to pick up a stray idea that was handed to me (from myself in an earlier time) and professionally figure out what to do with it, but also i know how to do this even if (god forbid) the idea actually belongs in the middle of the song"

        "question": "why do you upload reality videos years after they are first recorded?",
        "answer": "not just upload. select and edit. it allows me to make them better, because i know how the story turns out, so i know which things to choose, knowing what has the strongest relevance. and it also allows me to reveal behind the scenes details without giving away future projects. For example, if i released a reality video using journal audio recorded today, you might (for example) hear me talking about how i am definitely building an animatronic giraffe, and i am very excited about it. Well, guess what, if i release something like that, 2 things might happen. 1 is, i might ultimately fail at building the giraffe and have to abandon the project, in which case it would look very embarassing for me, because everyone would know i failed. And also it might be possible that someone could steal my design for animatronic giraffe and rush to beat me at my own idea. That's a fictional example, but here's an actual example, of a reality video that was released relatively soon after it was recorded -- probably recorded soon after history of japan was released, and the reality video was released probably 3 months later. The subject of the video was about making a music album. I thought, at the time, that i was going to make a music album, of songs. I thought that was a good idea at the time. but since then, i have changed my opinion and now i strongly prefer single songs. So those reality videos talking about making an album look pretty silly now, and they also incite a lot of people to ask \"where's the album, what happened to the album\", but there is no album. If i had waited a bit longer before releasing journals from that time, i surely would not have chosen the album discussions, and would have gone with something else instead"

I have a bunch of things I have to do like studying for history, setting up my strat guitar, putting together tracks, tracking acoustic guitar, vocals, drums, editing some songs, making a short film, try to make a live music video, etc. But then I see this list and I can't decide which one to do first and somehow become overwhelmed and lazy, so I procrastinate. How do I get my work done?",
        "answer": "get an audio recording device, press record, get on the computer, learn how to take screen shots if you can't already, and start brainstorming, and type out the list. take screenshots as you go (and say \"screenshot\" each time you do) so anyone who finds your recordings in the future can follow along with you. (screen recording is even better, if you do that just make sure at the beginning you say \"sync\" and clap your hands once). congratulations, now you are on TV, which is fun, and you're not allowed to be lazy on tv. so keep discussing things until you figure out what order the list should be in. Then once you have that, it should be much easier to do things in the order you have endorsed. This advice sounds outrageous now that i say it, but that's the exact and only way it works for me"

I believe I already have anxiety, but I've never seen anyone about it. Writing my paper for history brought me an incredible amount of stress and self-hatred because I knew it wasn't of quality. The rest of the class was enjoyable and the exams were easy, but I didn't really take anything away from it besides the stress. I love history, but what I really want to do is to is to write\u2026 fiction\u2026 movies. I do want to write about history, mostly about the history of American folk music, but I don't know if I want history to be more of a hobby than a career. I also took a required Drama class and just got 100%con my final. I enjoyed it so much. We talked about and examined theatre plays and I loved it so much more than my history class. How do I know what I should do? Should I change my major? I haven't done any n on-schoo l related writing in months. I don't want to get a masters in history and realize I've wasted years of my life. How do I figure all this out?",

The problem is, this language may be impractical as all hell, but it's also the only language that can describe certain things, that other languages just can't do or say, that the idea alone, that combination of meanings, was completely out of their realm of possibility, and that is fascinating.

        "question": "do your advisory statements on this page apply to more than just music? i'm attempting to work on many many many personal projects having to do with illustration and narrative storytelling, but i can't convince myself to put down distractions or feel motivated enough to start. the worst part is that i have many other things going on at the same time and i feel very overwhelmed to the point of giving up and deciding to play video games or watch other content on youtube, twitch, etc. i've tried some tactics, like writing down small thoughts that pop into my brain randomly, but it's beginning to feel more like an external catalogue than a bonafide process and that scares me because i worry that i'll never start this damn thing, let alone get it done.",

Above all, you make me think, and you challenge me not to think too highly. so i guess this is a thank you for your remixes of human ideas. (I also realize this isnt a question...

        "question": "i don't think you and i have the same process or the same goals musically but i am still curious about your opinion. i'm putting together a set of songs that are basically a religious service like there are liturgical functions for each one except the religion is fictional and this is a sort of alternate universe where everybody knows what to do in this kind of service so it's gotta sound both deeply ingrained and spontaneous so there are no instruments it's all singing, stomping and clapping. the constraint i gave myself to keep this project from taking 8 khgpillion years was that every single first-track take has to be improvised and then i stack more improvising as reactions on top of that track. fastest one (there should be about 16 when i am done, rn i have 5) took 2 hours, slowest one took 2 weeks because the initial improv was both extremely irregular and extremely precise and i had to basically learn it to improvise over and react to it in a way tha t sounded good to me. FINALLY A QUESTION FOR YOU do you think if you engaged in this sort of improvise-stack-more-no-precomposing-allowed that you'd let yourself get more weird and less polished or would you allow so much re-improvising that it eventually just became a kind of postcomposition? i am having some trouble with the bits of the improvs i don't think are as successful; should i allow chop-ups or is the one-initial-take rule a good one? i thought i could get this done faster if i hobbled my perfectionism by specifying ONLY spontaneous improv allowed, but there are so many ways to elude the spirit of that law and no external deadline requiring i actually do it any faster. what u think",
        "answer": "it sounds like a good idea in theory, but i've tried that sort of thing and it definitely does not work for me. what does work however, is to do a lot of improv and use certain bits for writing purposes. what also works well is to try to write very fast"

Every single day i watch drivers freak out at other drivers for doing perfectly good and totally normal things. i did not have to learn how not to be angry at them for it, but i am still learning how such anger and shortsightedness could occur"

Should I be worried about my grades in classes not pertaining to the career field I plan on pursuing?

Should I even be worried about what my parents say, or focus on what's more important to me personally?",

Look at even the most well respected pieces of art. You can see how they're crap if you put yourself in the artist's shoes. (is anyone going to think this is good, or is it just crap). So go ahead and adopt that mindset early, and that should allow you to have a nice rebellious good time, in the meantime, while you are gradually and unassumingly accumulating genuine experience, which will inevitably happen over time"

        "question": "Hey, can you share useful prime factorization techniques?",
        "answer": "sure. to check if 7267 is divisible by 7, we can knock off the 7s (26) now we just have to check if 26 is divisible by 7, and it's clearly not because your local multiples of 7 are 21 and 28, not 26. so if 26 is not divisible by 7, we know by extension that 7267 is not either. because to get from 26 to 7267, you have to multiply by 10, add 7, and add 7000. multiplying by 10 will never change whether something is a multiple of 7. and adding more multiples of 7 will never change whether or not something is a multiple of 7. so if 26 is not a multiple of 7, then you know 7267 is not either. congratulations, now you are supposed to check 7267 for 11, assuming you have already checked for 3 which is much easier and i assume you already know how to do"

I realized that the reason I'm unsure about getting one is that there are a lot of people who just click in notes and make perfectly good music that way. what do you think about that? is it just something that varies from person to person? I still think a keyboard could be an invaluable tool for quickly sketching out ideas for me though, given my short attention span, so I suppose I'll just have to try it myself. bonus question: does capitalizing only \"I\" make me narcissistic? I just realized it's something I do",

At the start of this year I travelled overseas for the first time and was lying on the terminal floor with my travel buddy waiting for the flight out. I was absolutely crapping myself with anxiety coz when I was a kid I witnessed a fatal plane accident and I'd never been over water in a plane and was overthinking like crazy. Anyway. I opened up YouTube for the first time in ages to try to find something to distract myself and at the top was Airport Terminal. I thought \"oh wow that's a cool coincidence\" and I watched it and it calmed me right down because it made the whole experience seem like a cool adventure. Thanks very much for unknowingly helping me. Also, the editing in that video is fucking stupendous and it blows my mind to think of the amount of work you put into it.",

        "answer": "because music generally uses families of notes that are not all equally related to each other. the piano, however, uses a full system of notes where each note is equally related to the next, but it's layed out in a way that you can easily skip some of them. the letter names of the notes were based on skipping some of them, because that's generally the trick to getting music to happen. so the spaces in between are called sharps and flats, but like i was saying before, to get that good music sound you wanna skip some notes but not all. and the letters are put on there based on having skipped some notes but not all. so some letter notes are direct next door neighbors (no sharp/flat in between). To explain that in a more real life setting, if you made a system of only 6 letters, with sharps placed between all of them, you would find that playing on only the plain letter keys would produce a very dizzy disoriented sound, akin to a time-warp or flashback scene. but instead the way the letters are actually arranged, this way you can just play the plain letter keys and automatically get something very friendly sounding, like joy to the world, right out of the box"

        "answer": "to explain to a beginner all the way up to the land of B# and Cb would probably be impossible. as it is, my paragraph was probably too long and they probably went to sleep during it. it's like, first you'd have to explain why B and C are only a half step apart instead of a whole step. that's probably weird enough for someone to get their head around. the B# issue would probably only become relevant after a person has fully absorbed the B-C half step issue. but to continue, which i don't know why i would because you must already know, but to continue, sometimes on paper you will see B# which is actually the same note as C. so the next question a person might ask is \"why the heck would you ever say B# instead of C\" which is a question i'm sure i have answered several times before, such as 11.23.18 11:28 pm, or 5.22.17 12:59 pm actually it looks like that second one actually takes you all the way through, so that's probably what i should have said in order to avoid being called on the complaint line"

(example) and one day i just decided i don't want to be called a monster anymore, so i mostly don't talk about it"

But when I play music, loneliness gets in the way and I cant seem to find motivation to do anything. All I want is to not be lonely. Even if you havent been in my situation, what advice do you have for me, if you have any of course?",
        "answer": "i wonder if there is any possibility that you could re-locate to a more highly populated city. maybe one of the legendary ones"

        "question": "alright (for context) i have seven groups of sticky notes that i use to document all of my ideas. six groups are for each tangible project idea that i have, and the seventh is a grouping of every random thought that i've had which i can hopefully utilize in some creative way. now, the hard part is that i want to make something from these ideas, but i can't decide which one to use first. this isn't helped by the fact that i constantly get new thoughts and creative ideas every day for each project randomly. how would you deal with this?",
        "answer": "first of all i think you might be better off digitally, with computer files. because they are easier to store and manage without making a mess. ok, so, keep updating your 'random' category. this will be your good friend, as you get new ideas. that is fine. there is another job title which is going through the 'random' category, selecting one, and figuring out how to turn it into a more tangible project idea, like the others. What i would suggest to you is this: use a random number generator to choose a number based on how many projects there are, plus 1 for the random ideas category (so currently this number would be 7). i can recommend random dot org for that. set the range from 1 to 7. (also you must assign numbers to the categories, so you know what the numbers mean). if it lands on the random category (7), then tangify 3 random ideas into actual project ideas, and use random dot org to select which ones from that category to do. then go back and do another random selection again (with a higher number this time, because hopefully you will have added more projects). Here's what i recommend: you must finish the project that is selected. If this seems too overwhelming, then I would recommend doing shorter projects until you are more confident in the procedure. some people are ok with bouncing between projects, but every time i've tried this, it simply turns into a license to escape. so these are my best recommendations"

        "question": "Consciousness can be kinda weird when you think about it, it is also very hard to explain, like, It's an active brain that is aware of itself kinda? But consciousness kinda feels like it takes place outside of the brain, like an extension of itself, the collective whole. It is absolutely mystifying to me. Though when you go to sleep, you have then 'lost' consciousness. Well, where did it go? I'm assuming that this means that everything was sort of 'separate' for a while, which makes sense, because a lot of the brain majorly either slows down or stops completely while asleep, and thus the whole is not there. But it's death that is weird. When you sleep, it can feel like an instant from when you fell asleep to when you woke, but when you die, that instant of being conscious again will (in theory) never come. You won't know anything, you won't be anything, and it's that thought that scares me. And it's that thought in which pushes me to slow down on lif e and re ally focus on the parts I enjoy rather than trying to do things that will get me material things, I don't want a job, I just want to make things, and I just want to be remembered, at least in some capacity, at least for a little while. Sorry if I rambled on for a bit too long there, but I was just wondering if you had any sort of insight or if you have any similar ideas/thoughts at all? Thanks for reading.",
        "answer": "that's true you're not the only one how do you figure you've presented various different ideas here, getting mind blown by the idea of concsiousness, yes that i can relate to wholly. you infered somehow that it's the end of all consciousness when you die, and i didn't really gather where you were coming from with that. and you said you want to be remembered, yes i can relate to that, as i think all of us can"

        "question": "Right now in Australia we're dealing with our worst fires in recorded history and have lost almost 500 million animals and quite a few people, including volunteer firefighters. Over 14 million acres have been burnt. That's twice the size of Belgium. It's scary and hard to comprehend. I'm lucky enough not to be affected but I feel dreadful not being able to help. I've managed to donate $130 dollars but it feels like nothing. It wouldnt even scratch the surface. It might put fuel in 2 cars with small tanks. It can't buy even a cheap firefighting pump, or hardly any livestock feed, or other necessities like that. It brings me to tears knowing I'm capable of so little because of my lack of money. Sometimes I wish I were rich, purely for the ability to fucking help more and make an actual difference. Sorry, I just had to vent a bit. I can't express these feelings to people around me because ffs, these selfish issues are nothing compared with w hat the people affected are dealing with and it's childish of me to think like this. Wtf can I do? I'm just one person.",

        "question": "so for the longest time i've been stuck voicing chords like a baby on piano. meaning like if there were a Cmaj7 on a leadsheet i would instinctively play it like (C,E,G,B) in the left hand AND (C,E,G,B) in the right hand. It seems kind of dumb but my entire understanding of music and how i made sense of harmony came from root voicing block chords. But it's a serious rut. because obviously listening to your music there's a whole other thing to it which i interpret as \"sparse-ness\". Meaning EVERY note can MATTER and hold serious weight leading into wherever it goes. I just suppose this anyway...But for Years i couldn't begin to understand the logic to it. Meanwhile, I plowed through a harmony book. learned about all these cool chords Outside of the major scale that relate to the major scale. and implement them as well as fun time signatures into my work in a way that was organic and good. but i still do the dumb chord thing. and so like a year ago to h opefully evolve and understand why I needed to change I started transcribing pop songs i enjoyed, completely. even maracas for like one upbeat on a single measure. So I think my ear is getting better because of that. i mean it might be ridiculous. considering i'm sure even the players for \"running on empty\"-jackson browne were looking at Much simpler charts than what they actually played. but i insist on doing it. Anyway! So all this time passes in my development and i still feel like i'd immediately fall face first if i were let out in the real world because of the chord thing. throughout all this time i would ask people \"how do i get out of this habit, how do i change?\" and they said almost every time \"...just do it? there's literally nothing stopping you.\" which seemed kind of asshole-ish. cuz it didn't really seem like advice. but lo and behold, last night i just \"did it\" and i can't explain how i \"did it\". i just did. the comping/voice leading was beautiful. it was honestly jus t a deci sion to do it. and it kind of pisses me off because i could've done this THE WHOLE TIME!! but i literally can't explain it. it's ethereal. something fundamental in ME must've changed, or something. have you ever experienced anything like this? not even just music but like being in a situation where \"there's a thing you want to do, you know what it is you gotta do, but something peculiarly vague in your bones is holding you back\"?",
        "answer": "ah yes, it is definitely fun to realize that way of thinking is mostly a myth holy cow it's worse than i thought yeah but it doesn't take long to get up. you'd be surprised how quickly, once you get out there actually for that issue, at least the one you first mentioned, i definitely have some tangible hints, althought it seems like you've already been through it, based on your experience with song books, etc yes there are many things like that, sort of on the periphery. meanwhile there are the things that are front and center which are usually the subject of a flaming freight train. typically the biggest thing that holds me back on the most important stuff is the vastly infinite quantities of configurations, iterations, permutations, transliterative concatenations, .,.,.,,.,,.,"

        "question": "alright bill, this year is going to be the best, for you and for me, creating for we are creators and is not creating the only thing that seems worthwhile? we are remembered for what we created, some might say its silly, why put your heart and soul in creations when, in the end, we will all perish. To that I say, how do they know.. I mean humans seem to have this drive to be remembered, its completely unreasonable when you think of it, but isnt everything reasonable? For example we have the desire to reproduce in order to extend the impact of our species, maybe the end goal is escaping the collapsing universe? who knows, but thats not my point, my point is that if we have this strong urge to be remembered, maybe there is some deeper meaning to it, one we cant grasp? perhaps this life is just the first stage, or maybe its a stage after a previous one, and the previous one impacted this one, we were rewarded with different skills because of our previo us stage s, maybe this cycle never ends.. i dont know.. i like deeper questions how about you? any imput on this one? good luck friend on earth",
        "answer": "why put limitations on it that way? for example, haven't i been working on extraordinary developments during 2019 that will lend itself to the work i do after? (yes) and what if there are setbacks during 2020, will there be a temptation to give up because the '2020' resolution seems failed? what if the entire duration of the year 2020 goes well, then will there be an understanding that things should go badly in 2021? i think it's best not to stare too hard at the jan 1s, and let time flow as it deserves it's pretty good but there are a few other worthwhile things that i can think of .... why use other letters in your sentence besides h, when h is the last letter i disagree no that is a great goal but first we're going to have to solve extinction. even before that it would be convenient to solve mortality in some way i think it's quite simple. the only way anything really seems to exist in consciousness is to be aware of it, and remember it. seems like that's a pretty obvious step 1 to reality entirely i would guess it to be one of the middle stages that would make sense to me deeper than what, exactly yes absolutely"

So I'm feeling extremely confused about music because of that, and I don't really understand anything I find on the internet. Do you have any sources that you'd recommend?",
        "answer": "i don't know any specific sources, but i can be a source. if you want to learn to read notation, i will probably want to start you off with rhythms. time goes forward from line to line. the first thing you want to do is understand beats. it's just like a steady ticking clock that ticks along with the beat all the way through a song. listen to some songs, and see if you can tap your foot along to the beat. also be aware that music notation flows left to right, and then down to the next line. left to right, next line, left to right, etc. just like the words on this page. let me know when you have found the beat for some of your favorite songs. if you look at the cowbell part for the second verse of my song 'hallelujah', that is an example of the beat. you might say i am hitting the cowbell 'on the beat'. it usually stays the same for the whole song. the songs you pick may have a faster or slower beat from that, but most of them will probably be slightly faster, because that song has a relatively slow tempo. see if you can find the beat for some of your favorite songs, then i will see if i can tell you what's necessary to start understanding what happens on the page"

        "answer": "you have to try to simulate seeing your project for the first time. if it is a video/audio project, make sure you are playing it from the beginning in real time. i have a superstitious thing i do during songwriting, which is to get up and touch the door handle, and come back and play through from the beginning. but what works much better, is to have some time away from it and come back. but unfortunately this is more time consuming. so it's good to try to have ways of simulating the refresh. another thing to remember is to imagine that your entire creative future lies on the other side of you finishing this product"

        "question": "Bill, I'm just writing to say i am impressed with your amazing song skills. Some of your older songs are pure genius, such as \"The Song Song\" which is how I feel exactly when I try to write a song. And the same goes for your new songs! For example, I could write an entire essay on \"might quit\", your latest song, due to all the weird, wacky metaphors in it. I honestly don't know how you do such astonishing work. Keep going, I can tell the new vid will be worth the almost-year-long wait! \ud83d\ude0a",

If roots aren't connected, some fungi can transfer the signal. The closer relative the other plant is, the clearer the communication. These messages are usually about the environment and slowly advancing dangers. Quickly advancing dangers (animals eating plants) use hormones and wind. Since these responses are to dangers, plants \"feel\", but as far as we know, not emotions.

        "answer": "why the heck would anyone sacrifice that. what on earth is to be gained by sacrificing it there might be some mistake. you might be listening to pop music's groupies"

        "question": "I am currently in the early stages of recording all my ideas (mostly writing projects, some non-writing projects) into timestamped text files; I have configured a immediate shortcut to do this, etc. I worried I am just recording complete garbage and that it will be impossible to sift through later, not even certain how exactly I will be picking and actioning these things. Are there any recommendable checks, measures, bits of discipline to make this whole process workable?",
        "answer": "i'll tell you the way i went through it. my plan, when i was at the exact same stage as you, is to go through them in order. talk/discuss (record the discussion also) the item at hand and determine where it's at. discuss its origins, discuss your first reactions, impressions, think about its origins, .... contemplate its place in the universe , ... and imagine whether you think it's worth it for it to exist / be finished. if you genuinely determine it's worth it, then start pursuing the next steps. determine what piece of it you have. is it the middle? beginning? something else? if it's the beginning, then your next task is to come up with the next part. this is best done by sheer runthroughs, and cut off right at the end, and listen very closely if the next bit will present itself. it can also be good to think process of elimination. what do you know it will and won't be? (categorically). i.e. will be a zebra/pony ride, or will it not be a zebra/pony ride. etc.... that could narrow it down. and again, continue raw runthroughs and cut off at end. If the initial idea was in the middle, that's probably just a lot of process of elimination. Once you have a significant development done on that item, document/date your progress and move to the next one. Then, aftar about 6 months of doing this (writing a little bit on each item) ... then, organize all the items into a new order, by % completed. appraise them all by % complete you think they are (estimation) and re-sort the list. Then, look at the top group (90 to 99% completed). choose (genuinely, without random assistance) 1 item from that group. Your next task is to finish the writing on that item. when i say 'finish the writing' i mean know how it goes from beginning to end. know all the bars, how many bars, all melody/lyric, chords, ... whatever constitutes your idea of a song in your mind, finish it so you know all that. mark it done. then go to the next group (80 to 89%). do the same thing. pick one, finish it. keep going like this, to the 70s, 60s, etc, all the way down, finishing (writing) 1 item per group. go around the group 2 or 3 times. Now, it's time to record. take the entire list, it doesn't matter what order, but preferably chronological. go through the list, (this will take a day or two) for each song, check how the song goes (properly consult all your documentation for it, read it, play it, check out all samples, etc. fully check how it goes, even if you think you vaguely remember. look it up for real.) then decide 'would i be excited to record this' or 'would i not be excited to record this'? your list of 'yes's can be as long as you want, so don't worry about 'to the exclusion of all other' just yet, just ask yourself would you be excited on some planet in some universe to record this one. if yes, then add it to a list (this is the semi-finals for recording selection list). Continue going through the entire master items list and add all the ones you would be excited to do. Then, as soon as you've gone through the entire list, IMMEDIATELY numberize the semi-finals list and make a random selection (using computer, like random.org. It is important that you do this immediately when completing the semi-finals list. Do not go around a second time. whenever i've gone for a second round of elimination, i often end up actually eliminating all of them. Trust your feelings in the first round. and immediately put it up for randomization (pick 1 out of the semi-finals, entirely computer assisted.) The one it chooses, that's the one. You should have already sufficiently eliminated any that are actually wrong for any reason. so you must trust this choice. And do it! This means, because you're working with a list of mixed completion levels, in many cases you will have to first finish the writing. then get to the recording. in cases of 100%, go still do writing verification. open the files, think and consider it, decide if the 100% appraisal holds up. if it doesn't, know that you are required to make a decision 1 way or another as to how to finish it, if not already. Then record it. that's the only thing you work on until the recording is done. and remember, if you get hung up because you think you 'can't make it good enough', remember to finish it anyway and accept your bonus: which is you'll automatically be better next time. then continue to do recording and continue to do it until you start to feel like it's getting so good it makes you angry that not enough people are hearing it. then start opening up some social media accounts,"

        "question": "Whenever I feel like doing something (play drums for example), I get bored after some time, even though I'm doing one of the few things I enjoy doing. Is this something you recognize at all, and what should I do?",
        "answer": "usually some discussions and conversations with yourself may reveal more closely what the core of your inspiration was for doing the thing. if you feel you are losing interest, it is because you have lost sight of the original meaning for doing it. Another thing i just thought of, you may have been inspired to play drums based on hearing drums in songs/music (together in an ensemble with other instruments). if you are playing drums all by yourself with no other music, just drums, i think it's easy to understand why that could be boring. so if that makes any sense, i think you might want to look into finding other musicians to play with"

        "answer": "if someone says 'waffles or pancakes', and nothing else, that is only a fragment of a question. they would need to say 'what' they are asking whether is pancakes or waffles. like if they showed me an item, and then said 'pancakes or waffles', then i would assumedly try to decide whether that item seems to be pancakes or waffles. Or, if they played me an audio sound, and then said 'pancakes or waffles', i would presumably be supposed to figure out if the sound is pancakes or waffles. When they say \"pancakes or waffles\", with absolutely no context, it presents a mostly impossible situation for me. so, given that the context is totally missing, sometimes rather than let the question hang frozen in contextlessness, i might make up my own context entirely, because they gave me absolutely nothing. so in this case, i made up the context as if the person was wondering which offered more leg room, pancakes or waffles, and also i made up the fact that the persons legs are quite small. so, in that way, i treated the horrible emptiness like a blank canvas. and i take blank canvases very seriously"

        "answer": "here is a great example of what makes genre names so tricky. you can use electronic sounds all you want in a 3 minute 'pop' song, that symbiotically meshes lyrics and music together in a way that hits hard and gets out (3 and a half minutes or less) ... you can drench that thing in electronics, but it will still probably be called 'pop'. It only tends to be called the names you mentioned when there is very little lyric and when it goes on for a long time. in which case its best use might be for some kind of accompaniment purposes. but regardless, i prefer not to discriminate towards or against electronics/computers. computers are a friend, i consider them just one of the many friendly assets of human life"

Doesn't help that the vocal sings another F# here but that's ok for that chord in that context you really don't need to say no 5. the way that is executed in context is perfectly normal C#9sus4, C#9. totally standard song stuff"

        "question": "when you talk about writing sessions does that usually mean sitting down and playing something to think of a melody, or putting something to a melody, or just whatever you think needs writing",
        "answer": "construction of music recordings and videos is very intricate, and it's like building a house. This is not the part i refer to as the writing. the writing process i am referring to is entirely before any piece of contruction matierial is touced. before any of the actual audio recording / video contents are actually created. i must know how the song/video goes, completely. every word, every melody note, and every important chord. and the exact tempo, and the exact sequence, and the exact road map all the way until the end. and therefore as a by product of that i therefore also know almost exactly how long it will play. This still leaves room for tremendous amounts of detail. All the details really. the writing process is getting everything EXCEPT the details. That's because when you are constructing the house, (or making the recording, or creating the video graphics), there are SO MANY things to take care of and worry about, just in terms of what materials you use, what details to put, besically that's when the paint actually hits. There are so many things to deal with and worry about there, i have found out that you CAN NOT be unsure of *how the song goes*"

        "question": "Hey, Bill! I need some help placing how is it that the chorus for Metallica's Fuel really works at all. The rest of the song it's pretty standard pentatonic/heavy rock pseudo phrygian but then you got that major I chord... with a maj IV and a maj bIII... weird. I mean, I think Cage The Elephant does it too with Back Against The Wall, but I have a hard time relating it to anything theory wise. Could you help me? Is it just \"we placed maj chords over minor pentatonic degrees\" or something? Cheers! Keep it up!",
        "answer": "? seems like you had a pretty easy time just there, relating it to 2 other songs, handily yes, although i would call it 'we put a 1maj chord where you might have expected a 1min chord to be there, thereby giving you an unexpected dose of happiness and pleasure'"

I don't know if you need someone to tell you this, but it's absolutely reasonable to look back on the work you've done before and have pride in it. also, personally I don't see how anyone can even grow as an artist if they were to honestly never take any time to analyze their past work(s) of art and just kept plowing through the work process as if nothing even happened. seeing you grow as a songwriter over the years, I assume you've liked (and disliked) at least some of the songs you've made, in some ways",
        "answer": "every song needs to be made with the attitude that this one is better than any other existing song, and the previous one was worse than every other existing song. that's just the attitude necessary for making the songs. so i think you may see how that interferes with any kind of proper data about which one i 'enjoy' more. can't you see, it's flipped because: i'm the one making them. i have no ability to decide if they're best, it is REQUIRED of my job that i MAKE them the best. even if the previous one was the worst, that was a fuck up. meant to make it best. next one will be best, just like every next one always is (or was supposed to be)"

        "answer": "don't worry about it. those names are going to confuse the hell out of you. i don't recommend calling them that, and i think most people do not call them that. but anyway, you know how in songs, like in the key of C, you'll get G7 then C. like coming home, right. well, sometimes, you'll hear D7 before the G7, then C. try it. D7, G7, C. i think that's what they mean when someone says the first thing you said. but like i said, i don't call it that and don't know anyone who does, because the names don't really make any sense. well, the name 'secondary' does i suppose, but 'dominant' i think will throw people off. it's not dominating anything. it actually seems more like it's the final chord that dominates the whole thing, if you ask me"

        "question": "I find myself in a conundrum often, where someone says something, and I can perceive (perhaps incorrectly) the type of reaction they want to get from saying said things. And it kinda shortcircuits my brain. where I happen to believe I know what they want to hear, yet I don't naturally tend towards that reaction. Which leaves me feeling like i let them down. Do you have any tips for dealing with those moments? Where you just want to react as you would, regardless of what you may assume is the desired response to their call. It's like I feel that i let them down whenever i dont give the response i believe they are looking for.",
        "answer": "they might sense you are faking it. i can sense this sometimes when people do this to me they want to be talking to the real you. so the best thing you could possibly do is just be there with them in that moment. if you are unable to process what they said in any other way, blank stares are fine too, those can often produce a great deal of humor, among many other interesting things, as the time unfolds i personally feel let down and get a very empty feeling when it seems like someone is trying to tell me just what i want to hear. i want to be enthralled, confused, surprised, enriched, or even underwhelmed by something from them that i did not expect to hear. so in your situation, i would take every opportunity to avoid what you 'think' they 'want to hear.' if they really knew exactly what they wanted to hear, then there are some chat bots that would be a better fit for them"

Currently trying to compose more 'flexible' music but my ideas are always based on mainstream music (eg. melodies are always in a 8-bar structure etc.) and whenever I try to experiment around to get something different from conventional writing most of the time it would just sound cringy",
        "answer": "this may not be what you want to hear, but you are going to find some music that you really enjoy which has the qualities you want. OR, if it does not exist, then you are going to have to invent something that's never been done before. so IF that is the case, then i would recommend finding things that you enjoy that seem inventive and new in other ways than the ways you might do, to at least familiarize with the fun and glory of being inventive. A good place to start if you hate all the music you've ever heard, is to start by deliberately trying to make something as different from that as possible, and then hone it in from there. you might have more fun than you expected"

What you must do is, use the absolute simplest thing you can get your hands on. like really simple. really really really simple. trust me, i have been through this, both ways, many times before. heck i am still going through it, especially throughout 2019 and 2020. You must use the most simple and basic thing you have. It's best to actually use something you already have, to further eliminate confusion and complications. Making videos is potentially the entire world at your fingertips. So that means you are going to have to take some desperate measures and precautions to NOT be overwhelmed at the start. staring at the whole universe of possibilities right at the start is enough to cause total brain failure. i wish i could tell you how many times i have been through both sides of this before. this is so important"

I've managed bigger projects before but something about writing a script seems difficult to organise Also being sad and lazy doesn't help but I'm almost over that.",
        "answer": "yes, it is multiple mountains to climb, and i think i already have a good solution in mind for you, but i will keep reading yes, for you i recommend doing shorter projects. and then if you are still even slightly overwhelmed, then i would still recommend even shorter projects. if you don't believe me, check out the videos i was doing during 2014 and 2015. if i could have started with something like 'history of japan' first, believe me i would have. but i was going through the exact same thing as you. building a world is a mindfuck. it can be done, but you gotta work your way up. i personally am still working my way way up, there's a long way to go still. but yeah, if you want the secret to unlocking multiple huge mountains, the answer is to start brainlessly small and simple. this trick has worked for me over and over and over and over again, and i am doing it again now as we speak"

        "question": "So, I usually write instrumental music. Y'know, programmatic/soundtracky kinda stuff. But right now I'm working on a song that requires lyrics. As it turns out, lyrics are fuckin' DIFFICULT. The music I usually write isn't very self-expressive; I'm more interested in seeing what I can bring to life in the mind of the listener by using different sounds, tones, and techniques. Writing lyrics feels more akin to public speaking. A very personal, intimate form of public speaking. I'm not used to communicating my thoughts so directly. I don't want to divulge too much of myself, but also I don't want my lyrics to be inane or cliche. Maybe I'm being too self conscious, or too aware of the hypothetical audience. In fact, I'm pretty sure that's it. Why is it that I always end up answering my own questions every time I go to ask them? Oh well, I'm still going to submit this one because I want to hear your thoughts.",
        "answer": "that's true the funny thing is that you can use absolutely anything. there is so much room to do things that no one has ever done before. just to focus on the word side of things, for you what i would recommend is, open up a text file. and go bonkers every day for 3 meals on a regular basis. that's just to get in the mood. when it comes time to actually do musical lyrics, i recommend coming up with it musically. and if you have been going bonkers in the text lately, i think you will be on your best game, linguistically and otherwise"

        "question": "I don't remember if this got asked before, but why was there such a long pause between \"stuck in a rut\" being uploaded to iTunes and your next single being put up? And how did \"stuck in a rut\" come about anyways? Given it's from all the way back in 2008 I'm curious the events surrounding it.",
        "answer": "hm .... it seems like most of your information is wrong. 'stuck in a rut' the audio recording was made in 2005. it definitely wasn't put on itunes until at least 2015, because i didn't have the abilitiy to put things on itunes until then. but i hopefully dated it correctly, based on when it was made (2005). as of 2005 and the many years before that, i was fully capable of writing and recording instrumental music, but the whole 'words' part of it was really not figured out yet. 'i'm stuck in a rut' was essentially all i could fathom at that time. although meanwhile i was going absolutely bonkers via text editors. which i recommend to anyone who is trying to figure out which way is which. my strategy in general was to see if i could deconstruct the entire universe and how it works. that was just the only way i could get my head around the full game of songwriting, including any and all musical/linguistical things i thought i could and might be capable of. somewhere around 2009 i think i found myself ready to get into the full songwriting game, but it still took a few more years after that to get the recording schemes, and the writing schemes, further organized. videos, is yet an entirely separate piece of the puzzle which i had to sort of put together from scratch .... which i am actually doing again now, as it turns out"

        "question": "Do you agree that scientists are underestimating how diverse life can be, by presuming water is essential to the formation of life rather than an energy gradient? Comparing Io to Europa, scientists assume Europa is more likely to host life because there is water there, but that water is likely completely homogeneous in temperature, providing little energy for any life, and even less places for that energy to go. Io is basically one large Yellowstone. Each of those geisers and vulcanic cauldrons has such a vast contrast in temperature that life may just fluke into existence like it did here. And those are in my opinion some of the less promising bodies. Jupiter herself is so vast and full of anomalies that there could very well be life in there, too. So basically, is water essential to life, or is water essential to Terran life.",

        "answer": "hm, that probably reminds me somewhat of how my life is going right now in your situation, it seems like the resolution to this may depend on whether or not you get even more pent up so badly that you explode into some sort of outwardly fit of creative rage. i may have just scheduled my rage for next week i think"

        "question": "i read the chord \"Bbsus4dim6maj\" just now and im so confused can you please explain this one",
        "answer": "ok well, the bass note is Bb. sus4 means you need the Eb note. dim6 ..... well .... dim usually applies to the 5 but i am almost inclined to think they are saying flat 6. but i'm not sure. 'maj' at the end is confusing. we might want to think it implies you want a regular major 3 in the chord, in addition to the 4. but i don't think that's clear. personally i would say 'add4' if that was the case. it MIGHT be referring to major 7, but in that case it really should say maj7. .... or they might be attempting to say it's a major 6 but that's not right, it's supposed to be maj6 not 6maj. so ..... it's really not clear"

I've been playing the piano casually since I was small and now that I'm trying to get into some more \"adult\" pieces I find that my hands seem to be too small. I can barely stretch an octave without twisting my wrists. Do you have any suggestions on how I can play the pieces I want to play without having to cut out parts of chords? Ps I'm at the age that I know my hands aren't going to get significantly bigger so just waiting for them to grow wouldn't really be a viable solution",

        "answer": "unfortunately i don't know very much about this. i realize it is extremely uncomfortable to attempt to participate in someone else's school, and that is possibly even more true for me than for most people (i am particularly incapable of learning things any way other than absolutely my own). but there's always this rumor that that particular school is threaded into the fabric of society in such a way that if you don't participate now, you may fall halfway down the social ladder. and while i think that may be partly true, i have also seen people use some very interesting alternate methods of climbing it, which can be extremely fun but you might have to believe in yourself, and the impossible, to a somewhat wild and lofty degree"

I was driving up the North West Coastal Highway, it was a long drive, i was listening to my Bill playlist and 'long long long journey' was playing (my absolute favourite) and i had subconsciously picked up speed, which sometimes happens when i listen to a song i really like. Then 'slow down' started and i checked my speed and was like 'o shit i am going 15kms over the limit' so i slowed down. And over the next hill was a police car! Holy moly what a close one.

        "question": "building off that person's chord-finding question, what are your recommended next steps after achieving the skill of being able to play a note that you hear on your instrument? I can do that, but my issue with chords is that I'm never 100% sure whether the chord I've transcribed has too many notes or not enough. When I'm in the process of adding notes to the chord, there are definitely some that are obviously not present in the chord. Other notes however sound \"good\" but I wonder if they are actually there or are just \"compliant\" with the chord and are effectively coloring it in a way that sounds nice. As for not having enough notes in the chord, that is a mystery to me. Maybe that problem isn't as bad though because at a certain point you've gone through all the notes in the scale allotted to that chord in a certain range of the piano and hopefully any significantly lower/higher duplicates of those notes would be obvious to pick out.",
        "answer": "don't include any notes you don't hear. after about 5 to 10 songs, you will suddenly start to 'get it.' after 100 to 1000 songs you will start to understand things even more. it's like learning a language. the first time you try to understand it you are definitely not going to get all the letters or even all the words. but if you spend enough time with it, eventually you will know it so well that you will be able to finish other people's sentences"

        "answer": "it has to be developed over a very short period of time, at an extremely young age. i should also mention that it is not important to good musicianship, and might likely distract from it. it also has a misleading name 'perfect pitch', because it has nothing to do with whether you can sing or play in tune. 'absolute pitch' might be a slightly clearer name for it. absolute pitch is mostly not at all what gives music its power. nearly 100% of the power of music comes from the relative relationships between pitches. and the good news is that those can be mastered at later ages, although it still helps to start young but it's not a deal breaker if you don't. where as with absolute pitch, you really can't get there unless you have it locked in by age 6. but as i said before, absolute pitch is hardly important for excellent musicianship, and might even be misleading or distracting"

        "question": "today it came to the forefront of my mind that the minute hand is constantly moving. How does time go forward? What pushes it? Does the entire universe exist, and our neural wiring just goes in a direction and that is the direction we see as time? Or is one instant discarded as soon as the next instant starts, and there is only one frame of the universe at a time? And if so, why is one frame similar to the next? What percentage of similarity does one frame/instant have to the next frame? What if the universe just did random things that didn't follow from each other?",
        "answer": "on some clocks it only moves once a second ok well you just changed the subject slightly, but it's actually just everything moving and behaving in different ways in space. and time is just a measure of how much it has progressed nothing yes it's not quite a physical direction, although it can be represented by physical dimensions quite easily, especially if steady movement is occuring each moment in time leaves significant residue i am almost inclined to suspect it's more than 1 at a time, but that is just my own hypothesis about consciousness and decision making ability that's generally because of a rule of space, which is generally that things have to travel the space in between if they wanna go from one place to another. although i understand this only applies to things of a reasonable size i don't know how exactly you would calculate the similarity but it's very similar because it's a very high frame rate then it would be quite impossible to ask these questions, i'm sure"

        "question": "i believe in some reality videos (probably between 2014-2016 i think) you said you were working towards an album, or wanted to start an album, maybe thinking about making one? did you stop being interested in making an album at some point? or are you still just as interested as before? do you remember why you wanted to make an album? do you still want to make an album at some point? i know you've said you thought albums are boring, but i think you'll find that a lot of your audience would like an album by you. you could go about making it once you have an efficient schedule and have gotten to the point where you will be ready enough and confident enough to start uploading videos/songs/music videos like you would releasing all the songs as singles, where you could have a music video for each song, and just release both videos and songs, or maybe the album as all the music videos put together. or you could just make all the music videos a nd songs, but release the album as audio first (with the cover obviously if you make an album cover) and then either individually release all the music videos at certain intervals (I.E. every day until the music videos are all uploaded, every few days, every week, month. probably not longer than a month between releases if its already made.) or release all the music videos after the audio. or maybe you could take a few of the songs you make (say, in the future you've released 11 songs with music videos in like 6 months) and you could make a cover, and call that an album. p.s. i would really enjoy an album from you, especially if all of the songs are similar within your style. @X",
        "answer": "ah, as you can see, i think this perfectly illustrates why it is best to wait at least a year or two before composing the reality videos. those ones you saw, those were probably composed within a month or two of the original recording, and so i didn't have the proper perspective to know that the idea of doing an album was a very fleeting idea. looking at it now, seeing the big picture, at least the way i feel about it now, music albums don't work for me and they've never worked for me. whenever i receive music on an album, for some reason i always think i hate all the songs. but whenever i receive songs individually, there is a much higher chance i will like and appreciate that 1 song. i can't remember exactly why i thought an album would be a good idea at that time. but my point is that if i were assembling reality videos from that time period, now, i would obviously skip all the stuff where i am talking about making an album, so that way i wouldn't have to explain how or why i changed my mind i probably was confusing it with something with a bit more of a story line right but if it's not what i want to make, then i'm not going to make it good. that's the golden rule of content i have never had a good experience with an album. i think it's just too many new songs to digest at one time. it seems very fatiguing and it always seems like there's nothing good on the album. where as if those songs were released individually, in most cases i probably would have liked almost all of them. it is still my belief that songs are not at their strongest when grouped together with several other songs and no other connecting tissue such as visual or story or both, or more. in other words, what i'm saying is, and i'm sure i have said it here 100 times before, i think the key to making albums be the best they can be would be to make it so much more than an album that it would no longer be considered an album"

        "question": "i've been trying to do creative work and have big ideas for a thing i want to write. i've been brainstorming and basically talking to myself in a text document that is purposefully designed to make me not look at it later. the process for this is a general thing i've been using for a while that i made so that i could write anything i want into a text document without worrying about me or someone else looking at it later (a side effect of this process is that no one else can look at it). this has also worked for smaller writing projects in the past (like really small) but i mean for this one to be huge and i'm worried that i'll lose these notes about the thing due to the limitations of human memory. i really do prefer writing in the comfort of my secure notebook though. should i just try to become more comfortable writing in a regular text document? the problem with that is that i'm worried that i'll censor the heck out of myself like i used to do an d some o f the real gems of ideas may never come out. i'm not sure what to do here. any tips?",
        "answer": "i think the answer here is quite simple. keep writing in the 'blind' document as you have been, but also start a new document with notes and writings for this project, which you will refer to again and again, and update as the project goes on. write in the 2 documents side by side. discuss things in the 'blind' document, and then when you arrive at important updates/decisions and writings, put them in the project document"

On 2.24.20 you were asked the same question and you replied with \"18\", which means that every 3 days the timer goes down by one.

        "answer": "i think so, but that's just a hypothesis. whenever i went through that stage i was too young to remember so i'm not sure exactly i guess my first question is, can you tell when you get it right. can you at least hear when you've matched the note. that must be the gateway to all else it sounds to me like you are too far ahead on paper. your ear needs to catch up. that's what it seems like to me"

I know I'm far ahead on paper and I know I need my ears to catch up, but i really have little idea how I could achieve this. (the same thing happens when I try to learn a foreign language. I can read competently in my target language but with toddler level's understanding of audio messages. so it really blows my mind when I heard someone who learnt foreign languages primarily by listening or there are some amazing creatures called illiterate who can speak a language fluently without understanding its orthography). I've been clueless for really long time, and wh en I sea rch online I can only see people who got a great ear but have problem reading staff or sth, none of them in the opposite situation. The things I think I can do now is just doing some mechanical ear training exercise i.e. recognize intervals, chords in isolation one by one, or listening for the melody/chords of songs (mentioned in the previous question) in a fruitless and excruciatingly slow way and wonder along whether I practice the right way... any advice on what I should do? (train in alternative ways or do the same thing with some change)",

        "answer": "they are using distorted guitars, so in reality they will probably just play a lowish C in unison (song is in the key of E, for reference), but on paper as a song i would certainly say it's C\u00b0 to C#min there. so in that sense making the C a 'power chord' would be rude, but not entirely a crime. they might have done it that way. or they might have fashioned it into a diminished chord actually, if only slightly. which can get kinda bloody on distorted guitars. anyway, i call it C\u00b0 to C#min. and again for C#min the similar story applies, except for that one the 'power chord' status is not discouraged, it is helpful and likely. i'm just giving my professional opinion, i have not specifically consulted the audio for this question, although i am familiar with the song in general and have heard it several times before. And before i forget- to harken back to your original answer, yes absolutely correct, although again i would recommend putting the bass on C. which i'm 90% is what they did but as i said this is just from the way i remember it. Ok i'm going to stop being lazy and just go listen to it since i have already rambled on it for this long: ok yes, they have C in the bass, and F# in there also. which is the best all around compromise. executing the Cdim which as i said would be quite bloody on the distortion but that's the way it goes. it's always a challenge to make this kind of real harmony happen with distortion on (basically anything except 5ths and 4ths will make a mess) but yea, they did exactly what i would recommend. played it right down the middle, using C and F# notes to approximate Cdim in just enough detail to work properly while still keeping the sludge to a minimum"

        "question": "3.3.20 3:30 am hey bill, thanks for answering.see i'm in my second year of college, and obviously that's not a place where you want to be lazy, but i have managed to just slip by in grades with some luck and the help of classmates. the point is; i always end up doing things at the last moment, were it be studying for a test or doing homework, i always do them at the last day, at the last hour, but somehow, i have managed to survive, just survive. and now the thing is i don't want to keep doing that, i don't want to be so lazy. i have lots of free days and spare time and i know i should use that free time studying or doing my homework, but i just don't want to do either of them, because doing something i don't want to just makes me feel awful, almost miserable, like i'm being forced into doing something i hate. but at the same time i know i should not feel that way and i should be more responsible . sorry for the long answer, but short answer to your question, what i want to do if i weren't so lazy is study and do my homework in my free time instead of doing nothing.",
        "answer": "there is no such thing as lazy. if you feel no energy to do something that means you are not getting why it could be so gosh damn much fun. and maybe there is actually no way for it to be fun but i would be skeptical of that because most things are fun, but the trick is you need to unlock the fun. often in your own entirely unique way. and if you haven't figured out how to do that, then it's going to be extremely extremely unappealing to you. like so unappealing it will be completely impossible to move forward with it. so as i said, there is no such thing is 'lazy', it just means you haven't figured out how much fun the thing could be right, that is nature's way of saying don't do bad stuff. pretty handy how it says that doing bad stuff is not responsible. the question is, is the thing actually good and you just haven't unlocked its creamy goodness hm ... i thought you said you hated it and didn't want to do it"

So is the naming/internalizing thing a good idea? Or am I completely lost?",

        "question": "what am I supposed to do with my left hand when playing piano? I know some options are \"play a deep bass note\" or \"play a bassline\" but I'm more interested in what people are doing when they have both hands in the middleish range of the keyboard and are playing more than one note in the left hand. Is that just a means of playing wide chords?",
        "answer": "i doubt it. there's hardly even room for 2 hands in the real chordal zone of the keyboard. if someone else is playing the bass, AND someone else is playing the melody, then what i usually do is tie my left hand behind my back. if you are supposed to play the melody and chords both on the instrument, then you're gonna have to put chords in left hand and melody in right hand and to be honest i don't have a lot of experience doing that. if you have chords and no bass player, and you are singing the melody, then i think you definitely are going to want to take care of the bass in the left hand and chords with the right. so as you can see, the piano is like a banquet table. it is used in all different ways depending on how many and who the guests are and make sure you don't put 2 whole turkeys in the exact same spot"

        "answer": "that might be because when different instruments play the role of the bass, they are all usually called the bass. when different instruments play the role of the drums/percussion, they are always called drums/percussion. however, when many different instruments play the role of the middle/chord/melody range, people like to call those instruments by different names. so mostly i think it's a naming situation you are noticing"

        "question": "If you close your eyes and hit a random key on your keyboard, could you tell what note it is? And how useful is it? Would you recommend learning it?",
        "answer": "sure well, if you have recently heard or played any other notes which you know what they are, then, ANY other note that is played, you MUST know what it is. if you can't get that then you need to get that. However, if you have not recently heard any sound or notes or music which you know the actual notes of, like for example if you just woke up in the morning and have no memory of any songs or notes that you can identify, then it is not expected that you be able to blindly identify the next note. having that skill would be called absolute pitch, and it's kind of like when you can identify a note in a completely and absolutely musicless way, with no musical relation to anything. this is a strange skill that is not related to music in any way whatsoever. To get back to your original question, yes i would be able to identify the note, because i can always remember the last note i heard, and i knew what that one was, so therefore i will know what the next one is when i hear it. also when doing this on a physical keyboard it is made even easier by the fact that the keyboard is shaped in such a way that you can eliminate about half of the notes just based on shape of the key physically"
