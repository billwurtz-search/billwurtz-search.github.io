        "question": "I've created a song that was supposed to mean one thing, and it's really great when heard in that way with that perspective. However there's another obvious way to see / feel it that causes it to give off really bad vibes. After catching those vibes when listening to a mixdown afterwards, it almost felt like I accidentally released demons during recording. But then I remembered the original intent. Basically the lyrics are kind of a joke and on their own are harmless, but there's still a well-intended normal base meaning I had while creating the song. I arranged and recorded everything fully seriously given that base meaning. Every word I sang was me singing about that base meaning and meaning it, and every piece of instrumentation was realizing the base meaning. However the joke lyrics taken at face value with the intentional arrangement and recordings create a weird vibe. I'm still going to release it, but it's an odd situation. I've learned that when you're making music you're kinda playing with fire because you're really playing with the human experience. Have you ever created unintentional vibes from a song or video?",

        "answer": "what works for me is to separate this into separate job positions. when i'm idea generating, i'm never in the same job position as someone who's actually gonna work on the song. it allows the idea generation to be carefree and optimistic. so when i'm thinking of ideas, i add things to the list that i think 'could' work. And the truth is, any idea can be made great if it's handled well. so i have the confidence to know that. so i add things to the list, generously. Then, at a different time, in a different job position, i have methods of selection where i 'select' which item in the list is going to be chosen to get finished, and produced. Or there's also another step/job in between that which is to just select things and just develop them a tiny little bit. So this means your initial idea is free to be almost nothing. Just a title.... just a couple of notes.... just a groove... maybe just an image, ... something that is almost nothing, but it's just enough for the next department to grab onto and turn it into something slightly more, for next time"

        "answer": "here was my best assessment of what it is, soon after it came out. what you have is mostly probably gonna work fine, and considering you're trying to do it on guitar, i'm surprised you're able to make all that work. I'm not sure if your last chord is supposed to represent \"into the\" or \"future\". if it's \"future\" then i'd say definitely prioritize the Eb in the bass. but on guitar i know that's asking a lot. after all there are no low Eb notes on guitar, are there"

        "question": "do you ever come up with one part of a song and then you can't come up with anything else that goes with that part how do you get out of it ( i tried imagining what would happen after that part but all i can imagine is a loop ) does it get easier to come up with more stuff over time, as you finish more songs",
        "answer": "can't Yet. That reminds me of how it's currently February, 2023, and we can't seem to get to any month beyond that all the information is relevant. For example: you say you tend to hear it as a loop. Ok, so, ..... is that good or bad? Is there any reason why you feel it should not be a loop? Do you not like the way it feels as a loop? Many great songs indeed are viable as a loop. So i'd say, be open to the possibility of a loop (unless you hate it.) Actually i should be more specific.... when you say loop, are you saying absolutely everything repeats? or are you saying like just the chords and certain things loop? Many songs have a loop but they still use different melodies for cho and verse, or something. On the other hand, there's probably other songs that actually just about use the same melody for both...... anyway, my point is, all the information you can gather from your impressions after the run through is valid, and should be considered. So in this case, your impression is that it seems to loop. Consider the possibility of making it loop. If not the whole thing exactly, then consider the possibility of keeping the same form / chords and then just raising or lowering the energy. in most loop based songs, the raise and lower of energy is the bread and butter that takes you from verse to chorus to verse you might get some more wisdom over time, but i feel like nothing is ever going to fully shield you from this dread zone of 'trying too hard' and 'thinking too much.' And i'm not blaming you. The reason you are thinking and trying is because you really care about this damn thing, and rightfully so. But the weird thing about music is it really clams up when people start trying and thinking a lot. It wants to find you, so be aware that it will find you. you just don't always get to decide when. But until then, just recognize all the information you are getting, which, in this case, is that it seems to require a loop. That's actually a very powerful piece of information. it rules out a lot of things"

That being said, it had no title or lyric when i selected it. So the reason it became 'meet me in septemter' is because that is the best line i could come up with for the first/title line. Going back to before it was selected, the reason i came up with that idea in the first place is because that's part of my job as a songwriter/producer. gotta come up with the ideas. that's pretty much the first step. I'm sure i came up with at least a dozen different other ideas on the same day. i tend to do them in batches unless a freebie drops on my head in a dream or something"

        "answer": "first let's talk about the way you just called it desolate: by comparison to every other planet anywhere near here, this planet is by far the least desolate planet. i'd say this is the only non-desolate planet that anyone around here has ever even heard of. To answer your first question, yes i think there's probably life somewhere else in addition to here but i think it's probably pretty far away"

        "question": "hi bill, so this might be a weird question, but you're one of the few people I know of who keep things real and down to earth. so recently I noticed that I was actively avoiding listening to a few songs that I'd vibed hard with. odd thing is they're all from this one timeframe, october 2021. that's very strange, since they're really good songs in my opinion. does this happen to you as well? like they're just uncomfortable to listen to. I know you try not to listen to your old songs. does that share anything in common with this phenomenon? because so far I kinda have a theory as to why it's happening for me. that was around the time I made some very bad choices, and they rewarded me at that time. as a result, I continued with it, a habit I have only recently been able to foresee the consequences of and have begun undoing (no it's not robbery or anything like that. more like self-deception). maybe I just don't want to be reminded of the time where everything took a turn for the awful? I understand if you don't want to respond to this since it's basically me venting using your page to do so. but I'm feeling better already :)",
        "answer": "i think so maybe a little bit, but i think that would be even more sensitive because i'm actually responsible for creating the songs yes, i think that makes sense"

        "question": "ok long question incoming. so recently i've been trying to use numbers to notate chords instead of just using specific chord symbols to the key (like 1m7 instead of Cm7). it seems like a good idea to get a good understanding of chord progressions and also to understand the relationships and how to transpose easily and quickly. i started doing this by using the real book and just translating them on a piece of paper. but i ran into this problem again and again and i really am stuck on it for some reason. Ok, so say we're in Cmin. an Abmaj7 chord appears. if the Cmin chord is the 1m, would the Abmaj7 be the 6maj7 (the 6th note of a C minor scale) or b6maj7 (the flat 6th of a C major scale)? i'm probably overthinking this but the b6maj7 feels better to me",
        "answer": "b6 would be the answer here. that's just how people do it. there is logic to calling it 6 but it's just not what you're gonna see people doing out in the world. the convention, for the most part, is to refer to the Ab chord as b6 in the key of C or Cmin. and 6maj would be Amaj which you'd be certainly not likely to see in Cmin but for example you'd be likely to see 6dom7 in the key of C, with a likelyhood of 2min (Dmin) after it, etc"

        "question": "what the fuck is a time signature and how do i read and write their expressions",
        "answer": "i guess 90% of the game here is realizing that the most common time signature is 4/4, also sometimes written as 'C'. This means there are 4 beats per bar. if you already have an understanding of beats and bars, then i can go ahead and explain how the number system works (which, again, is really only important about 10% of the time, because most of the time it's just 4/4 and you don't have to worry about it). But if you don't know what beats and bars are, then i'd have to start there. There is a mathematical explanation of how the time-signature system works, and it's good to understand that, but, there's also some ways that it's used that are more like a societal standard and not so much just math. The way the number system is supposed to work is, the top number is how many beats there are in a bar (4) and the bottom number is what note gets one beat. So for example, 4/4 (written on paper with the first number directly on top of the second number) means there's 4 beats per bar, and a quarter note gets one beat. 7/8 should mean there are 7 beats per bar, and an 8th note gets one beat. But actually, the second half of those statements is kind of shaky, because, for example, in a time signature like 6/8, which is extremely common, it would be like \"6 beats per bar, and an 8th note gets 1 beat\" but in many cases 6/8 is really felt more like 2 beats per bar and a dotted quarter gets one beat (which is mathematically equivalent, but no one writes dots in timesignatures). But, one thing that remains certain, it still correctly describes the bar length. So it would always be accurate to say, for 6/8 for example, there are 6 8th notes per bar. In 4/4, there are 4 quarter notes per bar. in 11/16, there are 11 16th notes per bar. This way of describing it will always be correct. in 3/4, there are 3 quarter notes per bar. in 2/2, there are two half notes per bar"

But i guess \"where i've been\" was still at the forefront of my mind, so i ended up launching into it within the first few seconds of the dialogue. It was actually my goal to really write something that combined song and non-song in a more 50/50 balanced way, but then there's also generally a desire to make the song playable as a song on its own, outside the video. As i continued writing, i actually broke out of the song and back into more dialogue after the first stanza. And that was pretty fun and cool, but i knew that wouldn't work for the song-only version. So then i found myself in a position where i was writing 2 different versions of this whole thing, in parallel: one version which breaks in and out of song, and another version that stays in the song once the song starts. And pretty quickly i realized that that would be way too confusing. So i just kept it in song without breaking it. So my goal of really mixing the song and non-song 50/50 turned out to be a failure, this time around. and the \"where i've been\" song ended up taking over, with no return to diaglogue, for the rest of the video. Also, the goodbyes section has a completely alternately written version, which still ends with the last line as is (where i was / wasn't). I ended up completely rewriting that section because the first version felt like it had too strong a similarity to the 'bring me down / pick me up' section of ground plane"

Also for the \" it's wrong its right \" am I right in saying it goes from Cmin7add9 to some variation on Bbmin7?

        "answer": "'rearrangement' is Ab7sus4 (or Gb/Ab). \"situation\" is Dbmaj, then Gbmaj7. also known as Cmin9 same thing as the prev chord, with the melody dictating whether the 9 is used the sliding flute chord you're hearing also contains the Db note. and the chord in general that the rhythm sec does is Bbmin9 (or just Bbmin7 if melody not on 9). the flutes don't play the Ab, just the 2,b3,5 cluster"

And sometimes too you'll even have a C7 (particularly before going to the F), but it doesn't feel like you're in C mixolydian or anything like that. < I can think of a lot of songs (especially common in old timey songs) that have a chord pattern like: C C7 F F#dim C A7 D7 G7 C A7 D7 G7 C But it still feels and sounds like C major even though most of those chords aren't in the key.

But I think for \"comes along for the \" you switch to an f major which in my mind functioned as a 5 to modulate to Bb but then u did an interrupted cadence to gmin7 on \"ride\" which I loved. Then on \"Change you're mind\" I'm hearing a Dmaj7/E then an Abmaj7 then it goes back to the sus2sus4 voicing on the E on \"stay for a while\". Then I'm not too sure but I think I've got the chords for the bit that follows which leads back to the main verse: Amaj7 Abmaj7 Dmaj7/E Ab Db I was also wondering why there were so many major 7th chords with their 2nds in the bass in this middle section, it's a very specific sound that's amazing to listen to and I don't remember hearing it in many of you're previous songs , correct me if I'm wrong tho.",
        "answer": "Db in the bass it's Dbmaj7 that's like F7sus4 or Fsus4, pretending as if it's going to Bbmin yep don't know where you got that right there i like them, except i don't think of it as 1 over 2, it usually feels more like 4 over 5 to me. i use it all the time. it's really not that far off from D/E, or E9sus4. which i'd use in the key of A. i also use them in more 'orphaned' key contexts. it's a nice way to land in a new key on that chord as if it's the 5. happens a lot near the end of bridges, if we've launched around through some keys, it's a good landing point for a 5 chord in a new key (or even, back to the original key, if it works out that way.) But it also is just a good textural modal vamp, in which case it would feel more like a 1 chord in mixolydian"

        "answer": "i'm not sure what kind of songs you're talking about, but if it's too overwhelming then you might have to stay with something a little bit simpler until you have a little more experience. but if you are feeling bold you can just go in and start trying to make sense of it. if it makes less than .01% sense at the moment, then you should stay with simpler things for a little while longer. but if you're getting at least 25% sense out of it, then it's probably worth the endeavor. and then come back to it again later when you have more experience and it will probably be even clearer then"

        "question": "Regarding you're songs, I noticed a shift in the harmonic themes exhibited from before \"here comes the sun\" to all the songs after the song. What I'm talking about here is how before you're year long break, the harmonies mostly consisted of like I-IV-V chords such as in \"mount Saint Helens \" and \"when I get older\" as the main chords in the verse, although they both modulate to the flat 6 at some point but those are during bridges and don't relate to the verses which is what I'm on about here. After said break the harmonies in the verses became more ambiguous, especially after \"I'm scared \" and in \"at the corner store\" where the whole of the verse is just a whole lotta Bsus4 . And in 987 where there's the maj7 slash chords and such. Might just be my imagination so point me out if I'm wrong. What I was wondering is, was this shift in the fundamentals of the music part of the conscious decision to change your style as of when you decided to master 3d animating during your break?",
        "answer": "i don't think your hypothesis is correct, but if it were that would be a huge coincidence because those songs were not all written in the order they were released. for example, here comes the sun was mostly written as it is now, by 2012 i'm a princess was recorded in 2019. and the musical shift was a production shift, not a writing shift, and that occured in the summer of 2021"

And special effects, which is the other thing I was interested in. And it wasn't really until I did Star Wars that we started to deal with some digital technology. It was very early on in the process of making films using computers. And we had to build some special purpose computers for Star Wars.\""

Also, i know this is a lot of work, but it would be nice to just have the sheet music to the parts in your songs so that it's easy to know what the chords are when there are like 8 notes playing at the same time, so that we can play your songs PERFECTLY with peace of mind we didn't get one of the notes wrong somewhere, because that is the kind of thing that will keep you awake at night.",

        "answer": "i've never been in your exact situation, but i think there's good news here. absolute pitch is just about impossible to develop after age 6. relative pitch, however, does not seem to have this hard limitation. so at least you don't have to worry that you missed the bus entirely on this. here's a clever suggestion: what if you somehow sabotage all the absolute notions of the note letters. for example, just transpose your keyboard or something. here's an even better idea actually, ...... hold your left hand on the pitch bend wheel and move it back and forth in a very small range slowly, while playing things with your right hand. maybe linger around just one or 2 notes, and mash the pitch around, tenderly, as if trying to scratch an itch. follow what makes you feel good. this may unlock some doors for you"

        "answer": "you can do both, if you can come up with a system you like, for organizing your time if you find yourself thinking about it, then you might as well figure out a clever system you can really get behind a number of different activities come to mind: you can write brand new things, and add them to the list. you can select older things on the list, and bring them to your modern writing table and learn how to work on them just as you would work on a modern song, fixing what you don't like. you can use your old songs as practice doing this. Another variation on these sorts of activities is: you can select something from the list and mark that as the item to be completed next (before any other) and then do whatever you gotta do to make it how you like it. The point is, there are so many different variations of workflows here, there's a lot of ways to get confused about which thing and which order you're working on things. I think as long as you're already thinking about this, it's worth really trying to craft a great system that you can really get excited about. in due time it can all be done, to the best of your liking"

Seems to be most prominent in ur songs released in 2022, now I realise that a lot of them were written at different times throughout the 2010s but it doesn't seem to appear in many other songs from other eras, so was this like a change you made to the song as you were performing it or was it predetermined",
        "answer": "not the chorus, but the \"i'm happy\" part seems to lean toward the kind of beat you might find in modern reggae those groove changes were known in the writing process. the title part of the song was written in late 2021, and all the rest (including the \"i'm happy\" part) was written in 2022 just before production"

        "question": "here is a quandry: when i make art i usually will either make a still piece or music. recently i have been really wanting to combine the two and even make ANIMATIONS. So, i did. over spring break i spent the vast majority of my time on an animation and, (dutifully keeping track of the time using proven timekeeping methods) and i worked 27.59 hours to make a minute and a half little music video. this is obviously not sustainable when i have to deal with the rest of my life such as school and work (which i still had to deal with over spring break). and now, im trapped in a loop of indecision. i so desperately want to make still art and i can usually finish a piece in 5-6 hours or so which is extremely doable. yet, i also DESPERATELY SO BADLY want to make music, which if im making an instrumental will probably take me 15-20 hours and if im making something with vocals (dont even get me fucking started) it will probably take me 19 BILLION hours to do, not even on top of the fact that i would want some visuals to couple with either and that would take 15 more hours and, if i commit to something, i will have a final project like 2 months later because i have to work and go to school if i want to survive. anyways, sorry for rambling. i guess what im asking is, how can i make myself commit to something that feels fufilling, even if i know im just setting myself up to get trapped in the never ending project. sorry i hope that makes sense.",

        "question": "Haiya bill. Just wondering in the melody, lyrics, chords, tempo, and roadmap, do you ever jot down ideas for specific instrumentation at certain points (brass hits, some guitar / synth figure, etc.) or do you tend to leave that for / change it up in production (examples appreciated)",
        "answer": "yes, if it's something very important and prominant the first example that comes to mind, to explain this, is not my song, but it's a good example to explain it: if i were writing the song Africa (by Toto), i'd say the huge drum fill just before the chorus, that would be something written into the song. because that's something that takes the lead at that moment. if you were singing that song to a friend, you'd almost certainly have to sing that drum part there. it's a feature. but anyway, here are some examples from my own songs, of things that were written, or not: in \"christmas isn't real\", no specific instrument parts were written (other than the core elements you listed, as always) in \"slow down\", the melody riff in between stanzas near the end of the song, was written (it's just about the same as the vocal melody anyway, but it was written that that riff would occur there, instrumentally). The instrumental intro, however, was not written until production time. the instrumental break in the middle of the song was also not written aside from knowing that it would sync generally to the verse roadmap. in \"i'm scared\" the bassline in the title verses was written. Also the short instrumental riff that occurs midway through the chorus (fallin) section, was written. however i think there's a different variation the second time around which was not planned in the writing in \"in california\" the instrumental lines in the second prechorus were written. the horn stabs during that time, however, were not. The instrumental riffs behind the vocal during the chorus/bridge ('alright') sections, were not written in \"i'm a princess\", the instrumental melody in the chorus (which is the section that begins after 'about my world') was written. however, the much crazier melody in the final 8 bars was not written, aside from the road map and all the other core elements that you mentioned (as always) in \"meet me in september\", the instrumental (and vocal) riff after \"celebrate\"/\"complicated\" was written. also the instrumental fill between that section and the following verse, was written (both the first and second times that occurs). Also the climbing instrumental riff in the 3rd and 4th bars of one of the middle verses, was written the bell melody in the outtro of \"movie star\" was not written. also in the writing that was assumed to be a fade out in \"i'm best friends with my own front door\", in the break after the first verse-stanza, the instrumental repeat of the melody was written in \"where i've been\", the low-B bass rhythms near the end (during the 'good times' section) were written"

        "question": "You said something interesting about how you can describe music as having three elements (melody, chord, lyric). At first I thought that including lyric in those three was a little silly but then I realized that that actually makes complete sense. Theres a very real extent to which the sound of a lyric or the context of a lyric affects the song itself or the way the song feels. Sometimes the best or most important part of a section is the thing that someone says during that section (e.g. all the soldiers surround me and make sure I'm lonely) Now, if one were to compose for a video game, that presents an issue. With a game, lyrics can be distracting, especially if they're in a language spoken by the person playing the game. So is music in games doomed to never reach the height of other types of music? I've also thought about using gibberish instead of real words in game songs, or just repeating one word over and over again (the Jet Set Radio soundtrack already does this).",
        "answer": "there are other variations to this, but when it comes right down to it, music and non-music rely on each other. another example would be the underscore to a scene in a movie. no lyric, but instead we have characters and things happening. and again, in that case, all 3 should be considered together, because their reliance on each other is so intimate game music can reach higher heights than a lot of other music. because one of those core elements is actually YOU and what you are doing in the game. this is a perfect example of music and non-music enhancing each other intimately no reason it can't be lyricless, for a game or movie score. the game scene/action is what takes the focus, instead of the language in the lyric of a song"

I ask because I noticed that a few of the notes found in the Dmaj7 chord are played in your \"money\" vamp at the end specifically on the E minor dorian chord , and after improving over it myself using a lot of dmaj7 I found that it has a similar sort of sound.",
        "answer": "i should mention, i don't recall ever knowing the word supertonic i'm guessing from context it means the 2 doesn't feel like E minor to me. out of context, or even in most contexts, i might say it tends to suggest E mixolydian, if anything. Dmaj7/E would be likely to be found in the key of A when playing over that i'd probably slip into things that feel like A dorian, or D mixo. with a lot of room to stretch and go wild, because the whole thing sort of exists in a sort of limbo state, as its supposed to, given the song context"

I've always wanted to draw, I see my sister and her drawings, and I just dream of doing the same thing. I wanna have a new talent. I feel like I'm ready to start learning, but I get scared and I just don't bother doing it. Has this ever happened to you? If so, or if not, how do I overcome this feeling of fear and lack of motivation?",
        "answer": "sort of wanting to do it is motivation. if you didn't have motivation then you wouldn't want to do it, and you wouldn't be here asking this. but i think what you are experiencing is like what home-owners experience when they feel like their neighbors lawn is always a brigher shade of green than their own. it's not really true, but it's a common feeling to have. i don't know of a direct solution for this, but simply knowing about this phenomenon is helpful. i'm sure there are things that other people see in you that they wish they had"

But i think the more important issue here is not so much 'how' but 'why' was it necessary, and the answer just comes down to technical limitations. surely they must have been working on an unimaginably tight computational budget, compared to today's standards. make every byte count. and when you truly have firm limitations, that's when the miracles just happen. because they have to"

        "question": "For \"more than a dream\" in the bit where it goes \"dum dum dum woah dreams make sense \", am I right in saying you go to a 2-5-1 in F#major, but the second time round you go to Emin7 after the lyric \"and the best days you'll beleive again\"? . Then going to an A major ish chord which would indicate that we're in Dmajor right? But you go back to F anyway. I noticed that you also teased a movement to D earlier in the song. In the bit \"I can't beleive what I'm seeing , it's more than a dream , it's more than anyone ever dreamed in history\" where you go from gmaj7 to Amaj , somewhat suggesting a 4-5 movement relative to D, and resolving to D at that point would make sense to the ear yet somehow you manage to return to F and still get it to sound natural. I'm intrigued as to how you managed wander everywhere harmonically and end up at the same place as if you were never gone. I also very much enjoy the Dbmaj7 to Ab maj7 vamp you managed to fit in, and if it isn't too much bother, what chords did u use to get from that vamp back to F major ?",
        "answer": "yep right just about. it's like A7sus4. and yes, the key of the moment right there is definitely D more like A7sus4, and yes, the key of the moment there is definitely also D absolutely yes UNLESS you've been listening to the song since the beginning yes. this is common and normal. especially considering that keys a minor 3rd apart from each other tend to be like ghost cousins. very easy to slip back and forth between the two to find the right moves, the writer really never knows what it's gonna be. for best results, almost like a sneeze, you have to almost forget your trying. you have to be very open to where the song wants to go. trying to tell the song where you want it to go will make no one happy. It's also quite common and normal for a song to find its way back to the same key as it was before, when returning to the same part. but you have to be open to whatever the song wants to do. Sometimes the song will easily yank back to F (if it was in F before). Other times, it may want nothing to do with F. And, of course, you have to also be open to not just the chords but, as always, the sum total of what the melody, chords, words, and any other context, is doing. that's the only way to really find where things go at any given time on \"anything\" it's like Gmin7 possibly avoiding the D note. then Dmin to start the chorus as normal"

        "question": "You said earlier that keys a minor third apart tend to be \"ghost cousins\" and while it could be argued that this is solely because that's the distance between a minor key such as D minor and its relative major , F, I was gonna ask do u think that movement between said keys can happen even if they are both major? As I mentioned before you did this is \"more than a dream\" where the fact that the bit in D was major was hinted at by having a Gmaj7 in there, giving an F# in the melody. You ve said that this is a very natural movement and it does sound as such, so have you used this same harmonic technique in any other songs of yours?",
        "answer": "when i said that, i was specifically talking about when both keys are major (or both minor). if one is major and the other is the relative minor, i would consider those to be the same key. but indeed the reason that (for example) Fmaj and Dmaj slip so easily, is essentially the same reason that Dmin slips so well to Dmaj. (for the folks at home, you might know this as the \"parallel major of the relative minor\" of F). but the important thing is, this is not discovered by deliberately trying to slip a minor third. it's just simply by finding how you want the song to go, and go there. Zero times have i ever deliberately decided to do a minor 3rd slip on purpose. in fact, sometimes i am driven to avoid it and find some other amount to slip, just for something new i'm not sure which thing you mean, but whether you are talking about slipping to minor-third-away sister keys, or landing in a new key on its 4maj7 with 3 note of new key in melody, both seem to occur quite frequently in my writing. again, in zero cases is this premeditated. the technique is to dive where i want to dive, and then let the analysts analyze later, which of course has no effect on the song, unless i notice certain maneuvers that are just happening way too often and then i try to avoid them for a while and find something new instead"

        "answer": "i have good news and bad news here. the bad news is, what you are trying to do, you cannot do. you are trying to 'write the song'. and you simply can't do that. this is extraordinarily bad news, unless you realize that the song actually wants to write itself. In the cases where you already have a first verse, and if the song wants to use that melody again, it actually comes extremely easy when the time is right. Actually, when it comes, it's likely that you may get a flood of 100 verses that all seem super good. but it never happens when you are in that frustrated mood of \"i can't get this\". it's a bizarre phenomenon, but just think of it this way: the song is going to come to you as soon as it feels it will be appreciated. and sometimes, when you're frustrated, you'd probably really appreciate some surprises, i bet"

        "answer": "it seems like there's hardly enough information in that line to really be useful. it sounds like it's alluding to something else bizarrely, it's not really gonna be \"you\" who \"has it\". ultimately it would be \"it\" who \"has you\". i know this seems annoying if you want it really badly, because it's almost impossible to get it to adhere to your time schedule that's exactly the hardest part it definitely is not bruteforceable. but if you really want it, it probably is meant to be. although, ironically, \"really wanting it\" is not the condition that will produce it. if you find yourself stuck in this 'determined' state, then it might be useful to try writing bad songs on purpose, for now. it can be surprisingly thrilling, and it is a way to access the reverse psychology you need, on demand, instead of having to wait until you \"don't\" want it"

        "question": "there are different ways you add text to already shown subtitles: - the first one, you show the whole text at the start of a sentence. - the second one, you add words to the text and , if it's centered, it changes position on the screen - the third one, you add the whole text but it's masked and then you add words to that mask so, here's my question: how do you decide which method to choose?",
        "answer": "the second method you mentioned, in my opinion, always feels terrible and i never do it (unless by mistake). and the third one you mentioned i didn't understand your description. but here's my basic theory for it. first, some terminology... \"word pops\" is when the words appear one at a time. \"cumulative word pops\" means each new word appears, with the previous words staying there. \"replace word pops\" is when the new word appears and the old word disappears, with only 1 word ever on screen at a time. \"entire phrase pop\" is when multiple words appear at the same time. Generally, in my opinion, when doing cumulative word pops, it's very uncomfortable for the staying words to move when the new word hits. this is why your second option doesn't work for me. However, often, i might want the final result to have a centered feel to it. in that case, i actually use left justify and use spaces to get the final result how i want. then i do the cumulative word pops to work toward that, so the words don't jump. \"Replacing word pops\" usually means the words are fairly big, maybe even full screen. Replacing-wordpops tends to be uncomfortable if it's a normal (fast) paced sentence. replacing wordpops is usually best for like a 3 word sentence where all 3 words are strong and emphasized. Otherwise, when deciding whether to do cumulative wordpops vs displaying the whole thing all at once, this is what i've noticed: alltogether works better when the sentence is an already-known quantity. a typical sentence. in other words, when i expect the viewer to already know the sentence. in other words, it's a sentence with no surprises. such as: \"how are you doing?\" or \"i'll see you tomorrow\" or \"i never noticed that\". It's basically a sentence that functions as one word. it's a package deal that everyone already knows. That's when it's usually best to make the whole sentence appear at the same time. But when the sentence is more unique, or has surprises in it, that's when you want cumulative word pops. Another method, for different situations, is \"letter type\" where it appears one letter at a time, steadily. This seems to be best when it seems to be some kind of pre-written, impersonal, formal message"

It seems absurd to me, because apples and oranges are actually ideal for comparison. They are both fruit and have many similarities, and their differences are therefore quite obvious. They are just about the perfect thing to compare. So sometimes i am driven so mad by this constant sort of zombie-like widespread mindless obsession with \"apples and oranges\" being so \"hard to compare\" that sometimes i just blurt out that they are the same. I bet it's been a hundred years since anyone has ever actually checked, to see if they are"

        "question": "Why are red and blue portrayed as opposite colors (like opposite teams or opposite forces or opposite whatever) when the actual opposite of red is a much lighter shade of blue? It's even used for the polarity on magnets. Is it because the idea of red and blue being opposite was instilled so early on in life that, despite the truth being different, people decide that red and blue must oppose eachother? Maybe it's that they just like that paid of colors. Or possibly the lighter shade of blue and the darker shade of blue are the same in a way, you catch my drift?",
        "answer": "i've never known red and blue to be opposites, nor have i been aware of a widespread belief that they are opposites. but i can see why they are great choices when you need 2 strong colors and you need them to be different from each other. if you try to use one light color and one dark color, that will probably create visibility problems because they won't work well on the same background"

        "answer": "i believe i'd consider that what i call \"chorus-superchorus\" form. first section is treated with the power of a chorus, and has a lot of lyrics, which lead up to the climactic *title line* which is at the end of that section (chorus) and explodes into the superchorus which will usually be just that crazy infectious *title riff*. (also a sidenote, sometimes what the song thinks is the *title* is different from what the marketing team later decides to title the song, for whatever reason)"

To me this moment feels symbolic. In the previous lyrics you started questioning your place in the world completely unironically, basically taking off the silly mask you often wear in your music. So that musical moment following it almost feels to me like you're putting the mask back on? Like, the mood got too dark and you lost control of the song, and now you're wrenching control back and making it silly again. Was that interpretation at all intentional or am I crazy?",

It seems like a complete sentence to me.",
        "answer": "grammatically yes, it could seem that the soldiers are doing the dream. but the way i feel it, the \"dreamed that it's ok\" is definitely supposed to be attached to the narrative singer, which therefore assumes a ghosted \"i\" and also the previous grammatic problem discussed earlier"

I guess this seems like an obvious non-problematic fact when I say it like this, but it's so painful when you miss an opportunity and you think of how much better things could be if only a few things changed. I guess this might just be one of those problems that you only think about when things aren't going super well, and the only thing to really do is wait for things to get better. At least in my situation, I haven't yet given up, so that's good, but it's still a frightening thing to think about.",

        "question": "I noticed a pattern in a lot of the bridges of your songs harmonically speaking, am I right in saying that a lot of your bridges involve a 1 - 4 kinda vamp or just progression like every bridge in 9 8 7 or the \"I'm not scared I'm just a little bit confused and overwhelmed about something \" bit of \"I'm scared\". What I'm asking about is what you would consider the key to be at these examples coz in 9 8 7 the C chord is like a sus4 7 with hints of major but I think the G chord that is in \"I'm scared \" on the words \"whelmed about something \" seems to suggest a minor kinda sound. I ask because in \"mount Saint Helens \" at the end you vamp between the 2 and the 5 in the home key of g, and this makes me wonder whether the indented key of the bridge in 9 8 7 is F major due to the 2 and 5 chords being outlined. Or maybe I'm delusional and a 1 to 4 movement for a bridge is just very common, so please enlighten me",
        "answer": "not that i recall in that song i consider those 2 5s in 9 8 7, the \"i wonder\" sections i consider to be in the key of F the \"i'm not scared\" section of i'm scared, i consider to be in D minor that's right that's right it's not even totally clear what a 'bridge' even is. just when you think you know, it becomes unclear. and just when you think it's unclear, you know. but that's definitely the biggest challenge of a bridge, is knowing what or why the word 'bridge' even is"

        "question": "Ok so like, I was wondering what the point of life was, and I figured out that it was the dot on the i of life, which is in fact a point, but then I wanted to find the meaning of life, so I thought that the meaning of life must mean the mean of life, so I translated all the letters of life alphanumerically until L=12, I=9, F=6, E=5, then I found the mean of that dataset which is 8, and then I realized that if you combined the mean of life and the point of life, you would truly have the answer to life so that makes .8 and now the word life is missing its point which makes it llfe, but at least now we have the true answer to life, but then I remembered that the answer to life the universe and everything was 42, so I reasoned that to find the answer to just the universe and everything, you must subtract the answer to life from the answer to life the universe and everything, meaning that the answer to the universe and everything is 41.2, but then I wondered which part of that is the universe and which part of that is everything, and I realized that since everything contains the universe as well as infinite nothingness, and since the universe is not inf inite, then the value of the universe actually approaches 0, and thus every thing must be made out of 41.2 nothingnesses. If you've made it this far you might be wondering why life has a value when it to is not infinite, and the answer is that life contains some of the infinite nothingness, for example my life is full of infinite nothingness, which is why I'm happy to say that life definitely equals .8 wait am I thinking about this too much?",

        "question": "in \"got some money\", what was the purpose of putting \"memory\" in the cuts between \"aaaacv\" and \"frenca\", \"frenez\" and \"loveqa\", and \"lovesz\" and \"zzzzya\"?",
        "answer": "What i would have preferred to do, is to be able to actually create that entire alphabetical phrase list. which i was able to generate quite easily, but the problem we run into, when the list goes into the graphics, .... the list is so long that it actually makes the computer lag, or probably even crash, depending on how you do it. There's literally millions of lines in that text pattern, if it were carried out properly from a to z across all 6 characters. So even though it's just text, it actually is an absurdly unnecessary strain on the memory of the scene, pretty much any way you slice it. And the truth is, in that scene, with the small amount of time it's shown, you'd never see all the lines. and also, another reason you don't wanna include the whole list is that the scroll direction would become incoherently out of phase. like those car wheels on tv that seem to move slow or backwards or whatever. So it turns out, even just to create the proper looking downward scroll, you need to reduce the number of elements drastically. like pretty much skip 99% of the parts during the fast scroll. But this still does create a continuity problem, because if anyone sees the (maybe 1) frame where you can see it jump from A to L or whatever, .... i feel there's gonna need to be an explanation there. So my explanation is 'memory' as a place holder for the perhaps millions of lines we've skipped"

        "question": "My list of song ideas, which are mostly just a few seconds of song each, is getting shockingly large. Like, it's well over a hundred, and I've only been collecting them for a year. I've written a few to completion, but it's always terrifying because I really really don't want it screw any of the songs up, because I kinda love all of them. I hope to start recording stuff soon, but that's a stupidly large rabbit hole that I've yet to really touch. So.... what should I do? Should I stop everything and focus on writing more for the songs I have? Should I just focus on trying to record stuff? I'm not really sure exactly what direction to go in, and this whole thing is feeling like a crisis at this point",
        "answer": "that's understandable there are many good options here talk it out, and you should start to see which way you want to go. new idea generation is always cool, you CAN continue to spend some time on that, however, if the guilt is killing you then you can suspend new gen for a while if it makes you feel more comfortable. If zero-record is k\u221ailling you, then you can suspend all writing for a while if it makes you feel comfortable. Now, assuming you will record, choosing which one and which order is nearly impossible, especially for someone who 'cares' as much as i assume you do. I'm sure that every one of them has immense desire mixed with immense fear. this is normal. On one end of the spectrum, you could try to just go through the list and choose which one you 'fear the least', but this might actually make you pick the most boring one. You could do a brute force random, which means leave it to the computer to make a choice (count them up and randomize). And this may be a good idea but it also might not give you the best results. i've discovered that a hybrid method tends to work best for me, and it goes like this: go through your entire list, and pick out any one that excites you. and add those to a pre-selection list. And by the way, amount of writing completion shouldn't matter here. all of them are available, including ones at .01% writing. if it excites you, add it to the pre-selection list. Then, as soon as you finish the pre-selection list, immediately count them up and let the computer decide from there. and that's the choice. then finish the writing on that one, knowing it is the next one to be produced. then once the writing is done, then go into production. this hybrid method (half my choice, half random selection) has worked well for me for a long time, but, to be fair, that was long after i already figured out how to record a song. The problem i had earlier with recording songs is that it was too overwhelming, and what i actually had to do was write insanely short songs on purpose, so i could learn the ropes on everything quicker. so you might have to do that, if you are feeling overwhelmed with longer items. or who knows, maybe you won't be overwhelmed. but if you talk it out for a while, i'm sure you can come up with a great system that suits your needs. there are probably a million different schemes you could do, and the method you come up with can be something you are really proud of"

        "answer": "like using a nail, a keyboard riff is usually surrounded by things that are not a keyboard riff. for example, go to the store and get a coffee, *keyboard riff*, drink the coffee. you see what i'm getting at here. if it's just a keyboard riff and nothing else, it feels useless. keyboard riffs are primarily in support of other things that are not keyboard riffs. in fact, at the right time and place, just a single note can be the most powerful keyboard riff"

        "question": "question. i had this thought years ago about how popular classical music today (beethoven, wolfgang, bach, etc.) sounds about 99.9% the same as it was when originally performed the 1700s/1800s or something. i now think that if the world were to reject any playback that could be heard by the listener (like the phonograph in very early recordings in the mid to late 1800s), supposedly they would sound precisely like their pieces when it was first orchestrated/written. would that be true in this case?",
        "answer": "that doesn't make very much sense to me. you are saying if the listener rejects anything they can hear, (such as recordings), then it will sound exactly the same? the way i'm adding it up here, it sounds like they wouldn't hear anything. i know your question makes sense somehow but i was unable to figure it out"

        "answer": "that will give you the extremely brash robot swing you used to hear in popular late 80s music. for a more reasonable swing sound, you'll probably want to find a 'swing' setting that puts the offbeat note somewhere between 55 and 59% of the way between the 2 downbeats on either side, instead of the 67% that you are currently using if the 8th notes are swung, write \"swung 8ths\" at the top. if the 16ths are swung, write \"swung 16ths\" at the top"

        "question": "I know everyone has a different path of learning how to make music, but what do you think are the bare bones \"music theory\" (I don't like that phrase, I prefer to call it \"music terminology\") essentials for a beginner? I think knowing the names of the notes ( just knowing what notes you're playing) and knowing basic chord names are really the most important things. I was thinking maybe understanding key signatures, but I think you can probably write a chord patte rn/melody without fully understanding what key you're in or that this chord is the IV or that chord is the vii or whatever.. although that would probably be the next thing to learn after basic note names/chord names. Maybe understanding rhythmic counting? But I feel like if you have a good feel/timing you can probably get by without knowing all the rhythmic terminology and how all that stuff works. Learning to read notation, I think opens up more gig opportunities if you're a working, professional musician... Buts lots of musicians don't know how to read music, so I don't think that's essential for a beginner. I was thinking about getting into teaching, but I started so young that I have very little recollection of first learning. By the time I started piano lessons as a kid, I was already self taught to the point that I had developed enough feel to play simple stuff by ear. And lessons for me were more learning the terminology, scales, chord names, key signatures, reading notation, etc. But even with that, I was like 4 or 5 years old and I don't really remember much specifics from my very early lessons.",
        "answer": "maybe it would be cool to find some kind of piano keyboard and start playing with it that would be useful for communicating with other musicians i'd personally like to ditch the roman numerals. they're just numbers, and i think the roman is much harder to read. i prefer arabic numberals instead (1, 2, 3, 4). also sometimes called \"nashville numbers\" yes, that is definitely good teaching might be very frustrating for you yes, teaching will be very frustrating for you. except for that one student who is already a self-learner, who you will love, who also won't even need your help"

Most of the time you will find yourself in this situation, the 'second' half of the process, where you will be tasked to 'work' on the song, and find ways to coax or conjure up those inspirations again. i have some tricks. One trick is to just look to the original moment for answers. continue to tell the story of where you were and how you were when that first part came up. and another standard procedure is to run through the entirety of what you have, in order, in real time. another standard procedure is to ask categorical yes or no questions about it. \"can it end here\"? .... \"does it want more of the same patterns?\".... \"does it want something completely different?\" .... also another thing that happens is if you think about it for a while and then stop thinking about it, you might get the answer when you stop thinking about it. thinking scares music away sometimes"

(you'll know if the answer is yes, or no). can it be sent back around again for a third time, in some different way?

        "question": "I saw a thing that said Unholy (by Sam Smith) uses the \"phrygian dominant\" scale. I'm confused about what that means because I thought the phrygian scale already has the b7 in there. Also, that song definitely uses the major third and not the minor. I guess that's what makes it \"phrygian dominant\"? (since the min7 chord doesn't have the tritone in there that a dom7 would). But you don't hear C mixo being called the \"C dominant scale\"? (Maybe you do, but I've never heard it called that). I know all this stuff is just terminology and isn't super important. I can play and improvise around the melody of the song regardless of the name of the scale that the notes are coming from (mostly root, b2, 3, 4, 5, b6, b7)... But I don't know, just out of curiosity, do you have any insight on this? The name \"phrygian dominant\" threw me for a loop.",
        "answer": "certainly what they are saying is that it has a natural 3rd (which phrygian wouldn't). i personally avoid the word 'dominant' because nothing's actually dominating anything. misleading. indeed, phrygian nat3, is what i'd call that mode it's nice to have a handy way to talk about which set of notes you're using for the song 'phrygian natural 3' would be fine. but a lot of people maybe don't know the word 'phrygian', in which case you'll have to spell out the numbers like that. and if they don't speak numbers then you'll have to just show them which notes to use and then you're good"

        "answer": "there are different reasons for different ways that way sorts properly. so this is probably the best way for data and file name systems. for example: 20230605220510. but for human reading, it puts the year first, which is not always what you want to focus on month-day seems like a good way to present month and day information. the problem is, of course, if you specify the year after, then the information becomes out of order. so in europe and many other places (possibly everywhere except usa) it goes day-month-year, so the information goes in a consistent order. of course it still won't sort perfectly, because the base 10 numbering system puts the smaller bits on the right. so for day-month-year to sort perfectly in a computer, we'd have to spell our numbers backwards"

        "question": "so, i've spent a while trying to figure out the chords to the first verse of \"i like to wear soft clothing\", and i ended up with this for the first 8 bars after the intro: Bb6 Cm7 | Dm F7sus2sus4 | Bb6 C7sus4 | Dm F7sus2sus4 | Bbadd9 Cm7 | Dm F7sus2sus4 | Bb7 Cm7 | Dm F6 it seems to mostly repeat with minor variations. i did come across one kinda odd thing, though: in the 6th bar, on \"me\", the vocal is on a D, but there's something playing an Eb a minor 9th above it. i didn't really know what to make of that, so i just picked the Eb to put in the chord and left the D out of it a lot of this is probably spectacularly wrong (some of those notes feel REALLY quiet - hell, i may have started making them up at a certain point), so i'd love any feedback you may have. thanks!",
        "answer": "there's no way those 1 chords are 6's. that should be Bbmaj7. and there's no way the 2 chord is C7sus4 the second time around. should be the same as the first time. this is just a repeating cycle. any variations are up to the players, but still, that second Cmin7 chord would certainly never be missed sure that's fine, although it's fairly likely that the guitar is doing like Ebmaj7 (with F in the bass, or the bass may be doing G to A there. i don't recall) i'd prefer not to listen to it at this moment because listening to the recordings can bring up some anxiety for me, so i'll only speak about it from memory, but i'd have to assume that the guitar/chord part is probably just repeating 2 voicings (Bbmaj7, Ebmaj7), and then the bass mostly probably will go 1, 2 to start (or sometimes maybe 1, 4), and then often 3, 4-5. or sometimes 5, 6-7. i'm also aware that i forgot to do it the way i wrote it. the way i meant it to be, for the bass, was more like 1, 4, 5, 6-7. OR sometimes maybe 1, 2, 5, 2-5. in actual reality, when i got on the bass, i just played the song instinctively and forgot about the specific chord choices i'd made when writing it before"

However, it does seem to perhaps give a sneak preview of some of the things that may be possible later when you actually learn to set yourself free like they have. something to look forward to it won't hurt you. but i think the magic of improv is going to come from somewhere else. somewhere no one else has been before"

        "question": "I've been thinking about how much something's/someone's reputation affects people's perception... Like, are the songs in the \"Real Book\" great, timeless pieces of music and therefore were chosen to be in the book for that reason, or have the songs become standards BECAUSE they were put into the Real Book? If the Real Book was never published, would a whole new set of songs have become \"the standards\"? Or what if Shakespeare never published any work when he was alive, and nobody ever heard of him until someone in the 21st century just happened to digup some chest in some old crypt that had all of Shakespeare's writings... would 21st century critics still be like \"OK, this guy is the greatest playwright and greatest English writer of all time... we must make high school and college students study his work\"? Or if Jimi Hendrix wasn't on every magazine/internet list as the \"Greatest Guitarist of All Time\", would as manyguitarists still think of him as being so great? I remember my dad playing me Hendrix when I was a kid and saying something like \"Hey, listen closely, this guy's the best.\" All our lives, I feel that we are explicitly told by schools, articles, magazines, parents, etc. \"This artist is great because blah blah blah... that artist is a genius because blah blah blah...\" You know those little memory-eraser things fromthe Men In Black movies? I wonder if the whole world had their memory erased, but all the music, art, literature, etc. still remained... would peoplestill gravitate towards what is today considered \"great\"? Sorry, I don't know what my question is exactly ... just ramblin on over here.",
        "answer": "there are different types of songs in there. a large percentage of them were already standards for a long time before they were in the book. These are things like 1930s songs with lyrics, many of which were featured in theatrical musicals, and were very popular. There's also a totally different, fairly small category of music in that book, which are songs that were trendy amongst the players who compiled the book at that time. many of those ones are probably not-so-classic, and certainly are not standards. but, regardless, there are plenty of tunes in the book that just, for one reason or another, just usually aren't good, or they aren't good when played from the book. so these are the ones people don't like to play. they turn to the page and say \"hmm, let's try this one\" and then it's like \"eich, no that one sucks\" and they don't do it. but then there are some that just shine like the sun, even through the paper. so naturally those ones are the good ones. And very often, the ones that were big hits long before the book, are damn great in the book also, even without the lyrics. what tends to make something a 'standard' is if it endures popularity for many many years. Generally if you look at the songs played at weddings, or in the pubs, you will get a more updated idea of what today's \"standards\" are over all, in my opinion, the Real Book has had very little influence on what songs have endured popularity among listeners and players it would struggle against a 400-year language barrier. even though he was spicy fresh with the language, there is no longer a population of native speakers of the language base he was starting from. if he were born in the modern day, he'd surely do it damn great, starting from our language as we know it today and then pushing it forward from there if someone \"assumes he is probably great\", i don't count that. the exposure helps, but in a way it's a curse because some people probably feel pressured to like him so they never can give him a good genuine first-hand listen yeah, that's a real buzz-kill for music. music recommendation is extremely sensitive, and it can backfire easily yeah whatever, that's clickbait, don't worry about that. in time you'll figure out what really floats your actual boat no one's true feelings about anything would change. fake feelings however, would be what gets the re-set"

        "question": "Is there a difference between add2 and add9? Would you play different notes for add2 vs add9, or would it depend more on context than how it's notated?",
        "answer": "maybe but not really. add9 maybe implies that the 9 should be in the higher octave, but it's also fine to stuff the 9 into the same octave as the rest. the reason a person would choose to write \"add2\" on paper (and i do), is to avoid tricking the reader into thinking they should play the 9 way up high. and in that case, if i ever wrote 'add9', that means i'm probably saying i want the 9 to be high, because otherwise i would have written add2. however, for \"maj9\" for me it is usually assumed that the 9 is not high. just because, in the professional world 'maj9' has come to mean 'must include the 7 and 2 and 3 and optionally 5' if you can prove that the transcriptionist commonly uses both symbols, then indeed you can assume that the octave matters, because they would have used the other one if they meant the other one. but if they seem to always use the same one, then i'd say there's no way of knowing which octave they'd prefer for you to put that note"

        "question": "What do you want your songs to convey to people? Actually I cannot point out what makes a song tick with me. Like with the Beatles' 'Yesterday', I like it but I don't understand why. I mean objectively it's a song about longing for a happier past, which is ... kind of ... lowly(Don't take this the wrong way, I feel there is some magic in the song but I can't explain it)? Like the right thing to do may be to move on right? So isn't it kind of... giving a message that it is ok to hang onto the past? But there are also songs about moving on like 'Let it go' from Frozen, which is sung in a situation when the character absolutely should not be moving on! But I still like the song. It feels like these songs don't capture the whole truth and I am finding it difficult to explain exactly what is the difference between them and absolutely lowly songs that only talk about sex, money, etc... that make me like them. If I were to make a song, I would want to give people the truth, or rather the peace or fulfillment that they want, but I also find that whatever I put into that song will be inadequate in doing so... How do you set standards for your songs in such situations, knowing all you can throw out there is incomplete and imperfect? I am asking with regards to your own songs. Obviously you have high standards, a particular way of making songs that don't talk about lowly things. Like for example your song \"might quit\", which is about leaving and doing your own unconventional thing in a way that makes more sense to you... I cannot explain exactly but I tried doing that for some time in my life and it didn't work out... I realized it was just a pipe dream. So ...I'm ranting a bit... I guess I'm asking what is that thing of unending beauty that you can rely on?",
        "answer": "if i could explain it, then i probably wouldn't need songs to help me explain it if you ever figure out what is 'right' or 'good', then it would never cease. like, literally it would be just one note held down for the entire time. if that's the best note, then keep it on. if there were a 'best note', then why do we keep switching notes? so in that case, the only thing totally 'not-imperfect' would be total blankness without any disruption. but that's not what we like about music, it's not what we like about games, it's not what we like about 'taking a hike', it's not why we're alive. we are moving beings the entire world, but, also, any individual piece of that world is sufficient guidance. but i guess if you find yourself worrying about not being 'good' 'enough' 'all the time', then i suppose it's worth remembering that every picture ever painted has some lines that go in the wrong direction. otherwise there wouldn't even be anything in the picture. So, when you go to make a new song, get excited about how wrong some of it is going to be"

        "question": "I often find new artists through looking through the Wikipedia pages for certain genres of music. For example, I found the band Television Personalities while looking at the page for \"Anti-folk,\" and I ended up subsequently listening to their album \"And Don't the Kids Just Love It,\" all based on the fact that the picture for Television Personalities at the top of the Wikipedia page was really cool. Basically, all this combined gave me the impression that this would be a cool band, based on their name, genre, pictures, etc. When I listened to the album, it was good, but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be, even though I couldn't possibly have had any expectations for their music. Would you say my expectations based on things that had nothing to do with the MUSIC of Television Personalities in turn made my experience of their album less enjoyable? Can that be applied to every artist? Is it best to just listen to a band's album cuz \"fuck it?\" as opposed to because \"they looked cool,\" or \"they had a cool album cover?\"",
        "answer": "no, it possibly made your experience better, because you were in a welcoming mood music discovery certainly works best when you are in that welcoming mood. because, at first, what else do you have? it's just the picture, the image, the title, .... you gotta start somewhere. so, indeed, these superficial attractors are a natural starting point. In fact, on some level i believe music actually needs something to latch onto, otherwise it doesn't even work so well. We've all had the experience of enjoying music in a video game. or maybe you'd go to a thrift store and see an obscure reggae record from 1973 that just looks magical. so you take it home and listen to it. Maybe it's good, maybe it's not, but being enchanted by how-and-where you found it, and the cover image, title, etc, certainly puts you in a welcoming mood, which will help you embrace all that may be good about it"

On top of that, there may also be some association happening with other people who have had that name. However, i should add, how people seem to 'look' is almost always heavily influenced by how they act, and how they carry themselves, and their personality in general.

        "answer": "generally, i'd say don't obligatorily include things into a song just because you have them on hand. in my opinion, working on a song is like being a doctor, and the song is the patient. examine the patient, listen to the patient, and find what that patient needs. don't just go into your doctors closet and get the bone saw just because you have a bone saw"

Some other languages, however, have different words for small height and small length, but only 1 word for long and tall. i guess the takeaway here is, there's never gonna be infinite words, so some sharing will have to happen. and, like cloud shapes, each language will have a different configuration of such sharing"

I can also move everything down until it fits in my vocal range, but the lowest parts feel way too low then. Do I just hope and pray that I can eventually sing it as it is?",
        "answer": "among the things i would recommend, i do not prefer the 'octave-down' solution. However, i have 5 other semi-strategies (at least one of which you've mentioned) which all have their pros and cons. You can search for a compromise for the song's key, which sounds like it will be a tight squeeze because it sounds like the range of your song is wide. but, indeed, do what you can to find a compromise key. the next thing is just to keep practicing and eventually you will be able to sing a wider range. another option in the modern day, is to use computer assistance to produce the vocals outside of your range. the problem with that is, the results might not feel as genuine as you'd be able to get with your true voice, and also, if you ever are trapped in a cave with only an acoustic guitar, you wouldn't be able to perform the song, and also, in general there's a chance that it may hinder your growth as a singer because it might decrease your motivation to learn to actually sing it. Another option is to find a way to get someone else to sing it. the challenge with that, however, is that they just might not know how to sing your song as genuinely as you could, and of course maybe you don't even know how to find someone and/or incentivize them to do the job. Another option, of course, is to do a bit of re-writing to find a way that the song could comfortably land in a different key for that part. this may require some out-of-the-box thinking, but it can be done"

        "answer": "i've found it almost impossible to predict what story is to be told, even with non-song storytelling. and for songs it's even less predictable for 'Perfect', absolutely nothing was predicted. the first ingredient was the location selection. from there, we get 2 people observing some car movements. and the scene unfolds from there. so everything is imagined in chronological order, during the writing process. and nothing is produced until the writing is done"

I also wanted to say how much I love the laid back kinda rhythm of 9 8 7 with the repeated drum pattern you do in most of ur new songs, which leads me to the question, how did this drum pattern come about? Or was it an unconscious addition to your style ?",
        "answer": "sure, that seems about right sometimes it could just as easily be a Cmaj7 surely the verses feel like the key of Dmin or Cmaj at the same time. if it's C, then the C chord is a 1 chord. if it's the key of Dmin (dorian) then the C chord would be like a b7 chord. i'm not quite identifying what you mean. in general, the percentage of new vibes (compared to previously established vibes) in any given song production will probably be somewhere between 10% and 30%. would be nice if i could get this figure even higher, but, as with most people, am self"

        "question": "do you think learning music theory is important? every time i try and make music, i get frustrated by how i don't know how to structure chords the way that they appear in my head and so i just stop. the only real things i know are that the harmonic minor scale is my favorite and that major chords do note, 3 spaces, then another note, 2 spaces, then a third, and minor is backwards. i just wanna know the complex stuff, like wtf is an Emaj9b7? does it sound good? maybe not, but i wanna know anyway. i guess it helps that i'm taking ap music theory next year. anyway, you're a god at music so keep it up",
        "answer": "it's hard to even be sure what that even means the way to actually figure that out, is indeed to keep going just keep playing with the notes and see what else you can make happen. you'll learn one trick at a time. and you'll learn slightly different tricks than other people, because you're you spelling error i think. it's about like the word \"refridgerater.\" spelled wrong, but, possibly more logical than the currently accepted spelling. assuming you mean the word refrigerator, (or, indeed, in this case, E9) then that would have E in the bass (one low note on E) then the rest of the notes in the normal chord-range would include G#, D, and F#, and optionally B sure. but what really counts is how does it sound in the song. like a refridgerator in your home, rather than sitting in the direct center of the Gobi desert"

Indeed if we're counting we also notice there would be 6 and a half 'quarter-notes' per bar of 13/8, whereas in a normal time signature there'd typically be just 4. also it should be noted that depending where you live, a \"bar\" might be called a \"measure\", and an \"eighth-note\" might be called a \"quaver\", and a \"quarter-note\" might be called a \"crotchet\". and a time-signature indeed might be called a \"meter\""

        "question": "What do you think of Harmonic Minor Keys? Do you have any tips on how one could use them in songs? Do you have a favorite one? :)",
        "answer": "it's really just a result of what happens when you are in the key of C minor and you use a Gmaj (or G7) chord no, but i can explain why they have a word for it. it's because someone was noticing that a 'minor scale', in C minor, for example, seems to naturally want to contain these notes: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C. But what happens, often enough, is you go to your big strong 5 chord and it's G7 which has the note B natural in it. and the melody may hit that B natural too. so the person was looking for a way to explain this so they said 'what the heck, just call it a new scale and say the B is always in it.' But the truth is, the B only really will be there when you hit that G7 chord (or Bdiminished or whatever). When that type of chord isn't there, you could easily have all your Bb's as normal."

        "answer": "on \"tell it to me once\", put D in the bass, then you'll have notes D and A in the chord, and the melody goes from G to F# to E. So, to put the chords most tightly with that, you'd have Dsus4 on \"tell\", Dmaj on \"it to\", and Dsus2 on \"me once\". indeed on \"me once\", a C# note may want to twinkle through. But if i were just playing/accompanying the vocal on one instrument, the C# note probably wouldn't happen. that's probably just happening in the twinkly bells. i assume you are not asking about the \"gone\" chord because that's at 1:53, and that's a whole different deal"

        "answer": "i didn't notice that, nor would i argue it no. the only time i recall a sort of 'small-talk' sort of thing happening with the waiter is when he says \"are you guys friends?\" and one friend slyly says 'maybe', almost with a wink. That is a reference to the title, and it also creates some intrigue about the nature of their relationship. The other interaction i recall is when the waiter suggests there are some tables available in the lobster section, and one of the 2 friends gives a sort of uncomfortable reply, this is because of his nervousness/fear about the lobster section as we've already seen before"

        "question": "do you feel like most professional musicians today have lost the love of music that they started out with? one of the reasons I chose not to do music as a career was that I was worried it would stress me out by having to make money off of it, and I would stop playing music for the sake of music. but the more I look at and play with ensembles outside of highschool, I get the feeling that a lot of people have gotten into the habit of playing music as a chore, and most ensembles are focused on preparing music for specific gigs, or just being able to play at gigs in general, instead of making music that they like.",
        "answer": "no indeed many professional jobs and gigs might bring us to cringetown. but amongst that, thre are many things to learn, about life in general, and besides that, there's also going to be plenty of situations where you come into contact with amazing players and have a great time. It's like speaking. people who speak for a living still enjoy speaking for their own personal reasons, in their own ways"

Similarly, it would be equally strange if, when playing the song 'YMCA' in the key of F#, if, for the first chord of the chorus, a C chord was used"

Anyway, try this: cut it along the diagonal to make 2 triangles. now take a second square and cut that one the same way. so now you have 4 triangle pieces. now rearrange those 4 triangles to make 1 big square. now you see, ... the height and length of the new big square is that ? mystery value from before. the area of the new big square is, of course 2. because you built this out of 2 original triangles which each had area 1. So what's the height/width of the 2 area square? in other words, what's the square root of 2? anyway, it's something point weirdsomething, but now you know a fun fact about the original 1x1 square, and what the heck that weird diagonal length was. indeed, it's the square root of 2. that should get you started"

        "question": "okay i know that 4/4 means 4 quarter-notes in a bar, and that 7/8 means 7 eighth-notes in a bar, but what's a bar? and what's a quarter note and a whole note? does it relate to the tempo?",
        "answer": "a segment of time in the music, like those big sidewalk squares are a segmnt of the sidewalk in most cases, a quarter note is 1 'beat' worth of time. a beat is typically the length of time that would recieve one foot tap, if you are foot tapping. in the normal time-signature (4/4) a quarter note is one beat. the 4/4 time signature is so normal that the quarter note (and thus all the notes) have been named in relation to a bar of 4/4. a quarter note is a quarter of the length of a bar in 4/4. and a whole note is the length of 4 quarter notes. in different time signatures, with different bar lengths, these names don't actually relate to the bar. the names are kept as if they are relating to a 4/4 bar, just because that's their name. at that point it's just a name yes. the tempo is measured in 'beats per minute'. so indeed if you increase he tempo, it means the quarter notes will go faster, the whole bar will go faster. the whole song will go faster. tempo markings often show a little note to actually indicate what one 'beat' note is. \u2669=100 means there are 100 quarter notes per minute. \u266a=100 means there are 100 eighth notes per minute"

        "question": "in \"money\", when you say \"i said it 3 or 4 songs ago\", are you actually referencing a previous song or is it a meaningless lyric?",
        "answer": "it's evoking multiple meanings. \"hello, it's a tuesday show, cuz wednesday seems so long ago. i said it 3 or 4 songs ago. IT'S TIME FOR THE SHOW\". Whether i'm referring to saying 'hello', or mentioning the 'tuesday show' or mentioning 'tuesday' then 'wednesday' in succession like that in a song, or simply declaring \"it's time for the show\", all of those are things i've either said before, or put in a song before. So that's 5 things at once that it means, and the 3-or-4-songs-ago is just an estimation, because all those things happened varying degrees of time ago. In the cases of things being put into songs, it's usually more than 4 songs ago, giving a whimsical over-casual sense to the estimate, but then the incidents where i've just said them (such as talked about them here on this page, or in notes, or otherwise in life) expressed things such as the desire to have a regularly occuring show, my preference for Tuesday for such an event, in those cases, the \"3 or 4 songs ago\" is just a way of mentioning time. indeed, when we say \"3 or 4 days ago\", we say \"days\" because days are something that happen so often and so regularly that they can be used to measure time. so it can also be seen that i'm sort of wistfully refering to 'songs' as something so regular and frequent that they ought to be used to measure time, even if just in casual estimation. most of all, all these meanings likely converge on \"it's time for the show\", which is indeed something that came out in an improv, in a similarly decisive and succinct way. these are the various meanings of that line, in context of the lines surrounding it"

        "question": "Hello! I love everything you do, you inspire me a lot! And it's my first time ever asking you here... I don't know what you're up to now, and you answered some time ago that you're not on schedule anymore, at least what you considered as a schedule. But when you was on it, what were you doing on the weekends, saturdays and sundays? They're the days off, but what do you consider as a rest for you? Do you totally don't learn anything, don't try to finish some unfinished songs, don't sort your music, don't write scenarios? Do you just sleep or going for a walk or watch movies or interviews all day? What would you recommend me to do to feel good for next week and do you think it's really necessary to take them, i feel really excited to write music and art everyday, but will i burn out of it if i will do it like that all this time? maybe you experienced this already and if so what would you do then? thank you in advance",
        "answer": "in the course of the 3 week cycle, the first sat/sun i'd probably be in the writing stage. the second sat/sun i'd probably be somewhere in the music production stage. and in the 3rd sat/sun i'd probably be slamming my way through graphics and video production not for that schedule. the days off would be like the first 3 days of the 3-week cycle, which would be the first wed,thur,fri doing whatever i want learning is usually the best thing to do during that time. learning whatever i want don't really 'try' to do anything, except listen to the instincts of what i want to do, or what i'm curious about only if i'm really really in the mood to do it could happen not if you're excited"

        "answer": "the name of the song is \"money\". the name of the video is \"got some money\" to make it more obvious that it's a song. a video titled \"money\" almost seems like it would be a video about money. but that's not quite what it is. \"got some money\" seemed like a better representation of what the video actually is: a music video"

        "question": "there seems to be two opposing advices when it comes to creation and the \"big idea\". some suggest putting it on hold until you feel confident enough in your skill to tackle it without \"wasting\" the idea. But another seems to imply that other big ideas will keep coming so just focusing on it now is good. I feel like the first advice can end up making someone to never work on that one thing they really wanted to put out there for fear of never being ready. Since they could always improve more before tackling it. Maybe its just a matter of feeling ready? and maybe some people are adventurous enough to feel ready asap? maybe its not about being adventurous idk, im just kind of brainstorming and maybe projecting my own personal feelings towards this situation. Do you feel like writing a lot of songs makes you feel ready to tackle \"big ideas\" in other mediums/formats like storytelling? or do you feel its a different scenario enough to feel like you need to work yourself up to the more ambitious or attached-to ideas. One thing seems for sure though, if there is only one idea im passionate about, it feels obvious to tackle that one, but if more come it makes sense to hold off on the one i may be more-attached to or more ambitious about. I guess my \"bad\" feeligns towards the advice of holding until one feels ready is the assumption that it forces one to focus on things one is not passionate about. and it may come from a completely subjective situation of being REALLY passionate about one thing right now and the idea of forcing myself to focus on something else feeling like a dam would be placed in this current world building flow.",
        "answer": "you can go ahead and work on the big favorite. but if you're too scared, then maybe you can't. now, you may ask, \"is that ok?\" and it reminds me of when they ask, in restaurants, \"is Pepsi ok?\" and the answer of course is no. pepsi is not ok. nothing is ok"

Generally i've experimented with a wide range of methods and timings for expressing lyrics on screen, and i'm usually going for what is most potent. timing is essential, so indeed i've tried the single-syllable way, but it almost always looks terrible and actually less potent, probably because we're so used to reading the words the way they are. by a similar token, sometimes in fact single-words is too awkward also, so i sometimes opt for entire phrases. i'm often pretty exhaustive in the amount of ways i try it, in search of the most effective"

        "question": "bill on 7.29.20 9:24 am you got a question saying \" Have you ever got brilliant idea(s) while taking a shower but forgot as soon as you leave the bathroom? It sucks when that happens \" and you said you developed some near military grade memory tricks for makign sure that doesent happen please bill what are the tricks",
        "answer": "here are some memory tricks. pretend you are explaining the idea to someone else, and start explaining it in as many technical ways as you can. Pretend you have to explain it to them so that they can reproduce the idea exactly, but, you are not allowed to actually demonstrate it. For example, if it's a sentence, say \"the first word is ___, the second word is ____,\" etc... Count the words. remind yourself how many words there are. Say all the odd numbered words. Say all the even numbered words. Think of the first letter of each word, and put all those letters together. try to come up with an alternate sentence using the same starting letters. Try to access the idea in as many different ways as you can. If it is a musical idea, start thinking of the notation of it, imagine you are explaining the musical notation to someone else without singing it. List the notes in order. Count the notes. List the rhythmic values in order. If you don't know musical notation in this way, hopefully you have some other conceptual notation system you use to think about notes and time. What tempo is it? what song has a similar tempo? how many notes are in the first beat? how many notes are in the second beat? etc etc etc. Keep trying to access the idea on as many mental avenues as you can, and this will increase the likelyhood that you will be able to retrieve it. However, ...... if you've really just had the idea of a lifetime, and your life depends on it, then you can get out of the shower immediately and go write it down. it's a good feeling to know you have that level of professionalism"

        "answer": "get yourself a pet list. (the list being your pet, not a list of pets). You say you generate a lot of starting points from improvs, and then they are \"lost to the moment\" because you're not in the mood to go into the office and do a full day's work immediately right on the spot. that's fine, and there's no need to do that. it's 2 different job positions. idea generator, and songworker. All you need to do, to complete your duties as an idea generator, is memo-record them and drop them into a list. Then, sometime later, on your other job as songworker, select items from the list and work on them. part of the problem could be that you were expecting yourself to do both jobs at the same time, which might not be reasonable. it's 2 different ways of thinking"

        "answer": "i can't find any languages that have a single word for equilateral triangle. however, most languages do have it for square. I think the reason boils down to the fact that in our 3-dimensional world, the dimensions are at 90\u00b0 to each other. which is what makes the 'square' and 'cube' so essential in our languages"

Almost as if you....... 'accidentally' want a note that's not in the key signature, even though you surely did it on purpose. When it's in the key signature, set up at the beginning of the song, i don't think they are called accidentals. they are just called sharps and flats. With key signatures, sometimes i personally refer to adding or subtracting sharps or flats as 'degrees' to a key signature (in order of the circle of fifths), but that is probably not a widely accepted term for that, especially because it collides with other musical uses of the word degree"

I feel like there's a positive connotation regarding someone who reads a lot of books (well-read, learned, smart, etc.) whereas someone who watches a lot of tv/movies might be seen in a more negative light (tv/movies rot your brain, the person is lazy, etc.). I can imagine parents being mad at their kid for sitting around and watching tv or movies (or internet videos) all the time... but if the kid was reading books all the time, the parents would probably brag to all their other parent friends \"Oh, Little Timmy is such a smart boy! He loves to read!\" I think, at the core, books or movies or television or even video games... it's all just different forms/mediums of storytelling? I don't understand why one medium is considered intellectually superior to others?",
        "answer": "they are older. so they are a step or two higher up the formality chain. if you live long enough, you can indeed watch many of today's media formats get pedestalized just the same way, in comparison to whatever comes after ya, that notion rapidly becomes archaic if anyone still actually thinks that (and i personally just assume no one does), the amount of levels on which that's archaic is mindboggling. among other things, it fails to account for the fact that 99% of reading is not done on paper books. younger generations in fact, in personal communications, tend to heavily favor the text message over the voice call. so who's reading now whatever's been established longer will be more firmly accepted at any given time. i imagine when books were first invented, they probably were often viewed as a corrupting and harmful influence on society"

And, the same thing works in reverse: if you hate vocal harmony and do not crave it, then, never use it, until you begin to crave it. this whole thing can be solved by listening to your cravings, pretty much"

        "question": "why is the series of chords \"4 5 1 6m\" so absurdly powerful? (subbing the 4 for 2m also has a pretty darn similar effect) i've come up so many melodies that use those chords, and i love every one of them. i don't think i could make a bad melody with those chords if i tried. i'm aware that a million songs have used there exact series of chords, but somehow it never gets old. like, the bridge section in \"do the thing\" uses these chords and it's so, so fuckin awesome there. thoughts on why these chords always just.... work?",
        "answer": "i don't have any exact reason why that sequence might be good, but what i have done is extensively categorized and analyzed almost every common looping chord sequence. the ones that stood out to me as being the most reliably powerful, for me, were different from the one you selected. it probably varies from person to person. it's also worth noting that your sequence is a displaced 1,6-,4,5 or 1,6-,2-,5 which are traditionally known as extremely common. another thing worth noting is, categorically how does it make you feel when you start these things with 4 (or 2min). in my list of sequences, most of the ones i found to be most consistently the strongest also start with 4. For me, it probably tends to be \"4, 1, 5, 5\" or perhaps \"4, 1, 5, 6-\" that seem the most reliably strong. On the other hand, if we're talking about purely popularity, then it's hard to beat the infamous \"6-, 4, 1, 5\" which is almost certainly the winner in popularity, among chord loops, over the past few decades"

        "answer": "it's a combination of 3 main processes. start, select, and work. the key to these 3 things is treating them all like separate job positions. the \"start\" department dreams up brand new ideas, and it really doesn't matter how small the fragment is. it can come from almost anywhere. the \"select\" department chooses which one to produce next. the \"work\" department already assumes that one certain item has been selected, and then sees it through to completion. the piece wouldn't exist without the \"start\" department, but the marjority of the composition takes place in the \"work\" department. the key to the \"work\" department is to consider the actual real-time effect that the piece would have on you, and then let that trigger what comes next, as if by lightning. and being struck by lightning is of course completely impossible, or extremely easy, depending on whether or not it happens"

        "answer": "an over-complicated name for just a bunch of chords the word 'progression' here is distracting and doesn't really make sense. it usually tricks people into thinking that all chords are somehow 'progressing', and that's just not true. it's like saying the rooms in a house are a \"room progression\" ....... really we just mean ... \"the rooms\". So, do you have to know what rooms are in a house, in order to build the house? well, yes, only if the house has rooms. if it's a no-room house, then you don't have to know the rooms. or maybe the rooms are already built and you just have to build the rest of the house. but, for a roomed house then you'll need the rooms, for sure"

How can I do this successfully while still remaining doing my office job(as leaving job just to convince people may not pay at all,i.e., it may pay but it is extremely risky)?

        "question": "your arrangements have a lot of little fast fills and licks hiding in them that always feel great, they sound natural and spontaneous but also do a lot of subtle things that my brain really likes. in a lot of your videos you'll highlight one and sort of break it down by showing the notation or your hand on the keyboard, which makes me wonder: do you come up with those lines just by playing them, and then analyze the details afterward? or do you compose them in advance so that they sound spontaneous, but they're actually carefully controlled?",
        "answer": "the big prominent ones are probably written into the song, but the smaller ones are probably found during production. regardless, nowadays i don't use staff notation either way. the big solo in \"airport terminal\" is improvised. the big solo in \"la de da\" is mostly improvised except it was written into the song that i would specifically quote \"where did all the good times go\". a prominent riff such as the one after \"celebrate\" in \"meet me in september\", was written with the songwriting, and same for the one at the end. although notation wasn't used. but transcribing notation and chords is trivial for me because i am fluent/literate in notation and chord symbols, so for me that's no harder than writing down a sentence that i heard someone speak"

That being said, i have no particular reason to believe any of the facts you delivered are false, but, i feel the need to point out that you didn't give me the opportunity to do so, so it gives the recipient a sort of 'trapped' feeling.

Please enter the number you wish to call, area code first.\" then you type the number, and then you probably have to say your name, and then it calls the other person, and it says something like (i've never heard this part, so i'm paraphrasing) \"some jerk named ______ is calling you and wants you to pay for it. will you accept charges?\" and they can say yes or no. and then if they say yes, you'll hear \"Your call is connected.\" and then you are talking to the person"

        "question": "is there a particular project of yours that taught you a lot while making it or is that just a standard thing for every project",
        "answer": "the one that really comes to mind is the parking lot video with all the cars (\"Perfect\"). this really solidified the phenomenon that if you do something 50 times, even if you are clueless the first 12 times, you start to find your way by about the 14th, and then you get super efficient by about the 25th. I watched this same exact phenomenon happen over and over and over again as i worked the assembly line in the modeling of 50 car models. from aligning the assembly line in the first place, to setting the initial shape and size, to wheels, to chassi, to roof to windows to plates to every little thing, done in the exact same order through all 50 models, and i watched the exact same cycle of cluelessness at first, finding the method somewhere between 10 and 20, and getting rock solid on it by the 30th. So reliable, makes me want to apply it to everything. And of course the other element of that car project, was the fact that i actually had to produce not 50 but 4000. And at such a high quantity, it requires me to invent/program a technique for doing it. If i only had to make 4 cars, i'd probably just make them all individually, and i won't really figure out what i'm doing. but if i have to make 4000, then i realize i can make 50 models to give enough variation, then i automatically learn a hell of a lot when tasked with propagating 50 to 4000, and also in making the 50. I vaguelly knew about all these phenomena before, but after doing that project it really made me realize the wide range of benefits that comes with unapologetically doing 4000 of something"

Also, in statistics and computer science, 0 usually means false and 1 is true, which would also make 1 the number that makes the whole thing true. It also makes sense of the \"2 and 1, what have you done?\" as it would mean that we finished counting to that number, and the \"1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, meef\" because at the end we find what we look for.

But then at a later time, I end up making a mistake and then realize that I had started taking that imagination for reality. So then I resolve to stop myself everytime I'm imagining, and that feels painful, and makes me stressed all the time. Does this happen to you too? What the hell even is happening and what is the solution? Should I stop myself from imagining everytime? If not, how do I never forget that what I'm imagining is not reality?",
        "answer": "sure you're always imagining somewhat. that's how we function. the actual raw reality, even just from what your sensory sensors are perceiving, is a firehose of data, which is unmanageable. the only way we are able to live our lives is to interpret that data as a recognizable thing. \"it's a cat\", etc.... so there almost is no such thing as truly observing what actual reality is. you're supposed to interpret it, which requires some imagination"

I know he had an acoustic piano and a celesta on set, and played accordion sometimes, but can't find anything about the synth(s) he used for the flutey sound, or the Purple Panda segments. I would love to know because it highlights an intersection of 2 things I am highly interested in: Fred Rogers, and the history & evolution of synth technology. But I can't find the answer and that really bugs me.",
        "answer": "try this: look at this image https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fred_Rogers_and_Johnny_Costa.jpg and look at the item on the top of the rack. notice the sliders, notice the white slider amongst the black sliders, and notice the text pattern underneath the sliders. then check out this and this. i believe that is the same item. this should be one of the variations of the \"arp soloist\". i don't have any special inside knowledge, i'm just playing detective"

But now I've encountered a problem: certain major 7ths are becoming flat 2's, which sometimes makes me cringe even in midrange. I googled a potential solution, \"stride piano,\" which requires insanely frustrating left hand precision. If I don't wanna do this, will I just have to IMAGINE the bass note while playing non-root harmony in left hand, solo in right hand?",
        "answer": "i don't see how stride piano has any relevance to this issue oh i see. you're trying to play melody things with your right hand, while also somehow accompanying yourself with your left hand. and i think, reading between the lines, you have no bass player. in that case, what you are doing requires 3 hands. if it were me, whenever i'm on a keyboard by myself, it's always bass in the left hand, and pretty much everything else with right hand, and, of course, my voice. If you are not allowed to use your voice, then i'd say just do bass notes with left hand and melody stuff with right. eventually it will become instinctive to start also throwing chords and harmonies in, with the right hand also. for example, if you play melody note E, and the chord is C, you might play E and C with the right hand. there's actually 1000 different ways to use the piano, and it's different depending on how many other players you have with you, and whether or not you are singing"

I feel compelled to just play the solo I analyzed, and 2. it's hard to improvise when i'm trying to AVOID playing the other thing. do you have any tips to break out of this? I've considered transposing the song to a new key",
        "answer": "sure. however far out you thought you were supposed to go, just go 100 times further out. for example, the box you are stuck inside is sort of magnetic. in order to get out, you have to actually fling so far away that the magnet can't get you. for example, here's what you might do: as soon as the solo section starts, don't even play anything. as soon as the audience (or, you) starts to believe that you actually might not play anything, then you may begin playing, but play actually a different song, in a different key, at a different tempo. enjoy. The hidden truth here is that you will actually slip back nicely into what the backing song moves you to do, but, unfortunately this only works if you are truly not expecting it. so what i'd suggest is to delete these last 2 sentences and then read this all again yeah actually that might be enough"

        "question": "what are the chords in the intro of \"the road\"? are they D, C+/G, Bbdim, D(#9)? or are they Dmaj7 Abmaj7 Bmaj7 (unknown)? or something else entirely? how did you come up with it (was it part of the \"make it bad\" technique or was it not that)?",
        "answer": "that's close it's that, but i'd say you have to skip the Eb note in the Abmaj7, to give the melody room to do C D E. and the last chord.... i hear A in the melody, F in the bass, i also hear D, and it feels crunchy in a way that Dmaj/F would feel. Without opening it up, that's my best guess. Okay, i've opened it, and i was right. and it's also worth noting that actually none of the maj7's have their 5 notes in them. Also, plot twist now, there is more to the puzzle: in addition to the harpsicord (playing the chords) there is also a bell playing these single notes on each chord: D, A, C#, G#. so the Bmaj7 is in fact more like Bmaj9, the Ab chord is now extremely illegal (although the meat of the bell note can't really be heard, so it doesn't seem to disturb the harmony, surprisingly. only its twinkle seems to be audible), and the final G# just intermingles with what was already a crunch chord all i remember is that i had another intro written and it just wasn't working, and this is not it. so this is a last minute solution i came up with"

There *is* an acoustic piano somewhat nearby to me, so should I just practice like crazy on that, or will it be fine? I know you play with unweighted keys, so I figure that you might have come across this situation before",
        "answer": "meh ............ yeah it's different but not really worth worrying about. it's like about the same as the difference between an american english dialect and an australian english dialect. the amount of trouble you may have playing a weighted keyboard might be about the same level of difficulty that an australian person and a usa person would have, understanding each other in conversation. which i estimate is not very much trouble"

        "answer": "yeah...... this usually has nothing to do with polish. it has to do with whether or not there is actually anything there. whether anything really happened. and, admittedly, it's usually not possible to conjure 'something' and put it there on an as-needed basis. from what you described, my guess is that the song feels too 'normal'. in that case, here's a good tweak you can do: try to change it so it somehow no longer fits in the category of 'song'. In other words, if you had to change it so it would officially no longer be considered a 'song', what change would that be? give it a try. and then call it a song anyway. that's pretty much the go-to strategy i would use here. songs love not being songs"

'extension' implies it's different than it was sure. actually 'add4' tends to mean the 3 is also there. otherwise it's called 'sus4' if it's minor, you probably should either write \"min\", \"minor\", \"-\", \"m\", or put the numeral in lowercase. but i'm actually not sure if that many people can read roman numerals nowadays seems normal, except the way you notated the F is weird because it looks like it includes Eb and E notes at the same time. it's most likely a notation mistake, considering the rest of the sequence looks common and normal it doesn't sound like anything on the page. you'd have to play it somehow"

        "question": "Hello Bill Wurtz on Bill Wurtz Dot Com. Thank you very much for the music. I hope it brings you as much joy to make it as it does for me to listen to it (which is a lot)! As a creative, would you recommend pursing a career in a creative job (screenwriting) even though statistically I will likely not find serious work? I have stories I'm very proud of and I want to tell but sometimes I worry it's just a pipe dream, and I ought to wisen up. (Unfortunately I'm not related to anyone currently in the film industry). Thank you.",
        "answer": "if you have stories, you should go ahead and tell them. this does not necessarily mean doing something as formal as what you described in your statistical analysis. and, in fact, if you tell your own stories, statistically, that's gonna work. you're gonna be able to do it. the statistical unlikelihood you described earlier had more to do with job-searching in a collaborative industry, and much less to do with telling stories, especially your own"

I'm not 100% sold on the idea, but it's fun to think about past lives. I have this thought that consciouness, much like matter and energy, cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.

        "question": "Hey bill, really random advice question: When i was in high school i was in choir, and it was one of the most meaningful experiences i've ever had. A lot of factors contributed to this: the director, the group of ppl that formed the choir, the songs we chose, the standard we held ourselves to Since leaving school, i've tried joining other choirs, and while they haven't been *bad* experiences, i always just end up feeling disappointed that it's not as special as high school choir was. How do i get over that so i can enjoy choir again?",

Wonderful and creative people like you create these really amazing, deep songs effortlessly while I'm over here struggling to form a decent sentence or drawing. How do you do it all? What does it take to create shit that people would care about and remember? I try to tell myself that it takes courage to be bad at something, knowing that if you put time and energy into it'll all work out in the end. I'm just in a really dark place right now and would love to hear back from you... :)",

        "question": "oh, ohhhh. okay so knowing scales is perhaps important to know chord nomenclature? a major chord is the 1st, 3rd, and 5th note of the scale. a minor chord is the 1st, flattened 3rd, and 5th note. sus2 is 1, 2, 5. Csus4 is 1 4, 5? okay but what's the difference between a minor scale and a major scale? and the difference between playing in a minor and major key? and a what is a major chord in a minor scale? and can chords be shared by two scales? fuck. how do i learn chords and harmony without learning scales? i wouldn't mind learning scales but i want to play freely",
        "answer": "maybe yep C major scale would go like this: C D E F G A B C. and the C minor scale, at least the first part, goes like this: C D Eb F G. and the rest of it may depend on what the chords are at any given time explaining this is like explaining the difference between a happy face and a sad face. it's not always possible to explain the difference, but you can just sense it. and of course some songs play tricks on you and kind of use both. other songs are very clear about it. jingle bells is major. \"stayin alive\" by the BeeGees is minor. generally, in a major key song, the \"1\" chord (sometimes called the \"root\" chord) would generally be major. and in a minor song, the \"1\" chord would generally be minor. now, how do you know what the root chord is? again, it's similar to knowing which side of someone's face is the top. how do you recognize this when a person is lying on their side? i have no idea, but you just know somehow well, if you are in the key of C minor, it's fairly likely that you may hear some Eb major chords somewhere in the song, or Ab major or Bb major. Actually, it's fairly likely you may even hear the G major chord somewhere in a C minor song. that gets back to what i was saying about that part of the minor scale which tends to flex based on what chords are there sure..... a C major chord would be likely to be found in the key of C, but also likely to be found in the key of G, or F, or A minor, or D minor, etc no need to worry. just keep listening, keep playing, and let yourself be curious about whatever you find yourself curious about at any given time. it's all there for you, and also, it's magic, which sometimes makes it impossible to explain, but it's also the whole reason you're into it in that case, my recommendation is to just never play scales in order. and also, as soon as you can, make friends with the 'chromatic' scale, which is just all the notes"

        "question": "how would you analyse the function of the VI in a I VI IV progression? (example: toby fox's \"fallen down\")",
        "answer": "first i'd translate it to arabic numerals (or even just pick a key and use letters) because roman numerals make my eyes bleed (that's just a personal issue i have). then, checking what the song sounds like, i'd consider it more specifically than what you wrote. i'd say it's Dbmaj7, /, Bb7, /, Gbmaj7, Gbminmaj7, Db, Ab. (actually the whole thing seems to be tuned somewhere in between the key of Db and D, so don't take those chord letters as absolutes necessarily. still only using them for relative purposes) as for your question, my analysis of the function of the Bb7 in this case is: it's musical. it reminds me of things i've heard in other music, and, this song is, in fact, music, so this doesn't surprise me. reading back over this it occurs to me that you might not think i'm serious, but i am in fact dead-on serious about all of this. music is precisely what's happening here, and that's no joke. i've dedicated my whole life to this stuff"

It was tempting at first to suggest that christmas candy would be the oldest, but the fact is that most stores actually begin putting out the christmas candy on halloween day, and have already moved the halloween merchandise to the discount area. so it's actually quite likely that even an ordinary consumer would be able to find brand new christmas candy, on halloween day. by this logic, easter candy would actually be the best and freshest candy on valentine's day"

        "question": "i've been working with the chromatic scale. my strategy is to let every note feel loved, and also to use the piano to lead the rhythm. it sounds very janky and awkward and dissonant, but there was a brief moment where i could hum each note before i played it at a not-very-fast place. i think i want to be able to do that faster: predict each note before i play it. but i wonder if my answer lies in intervals... i saw a few charts where they didn't specify the key of the song but the note of the scale like so: 1 5 5 2 1 1. how would that work for the chromstic scale? it wouldn't, right? when i was playing with the form of My Favorite Things (by ear, at first), i found that i could be a lot freer with the melody than i wanted. but i don't know what to do. actually i don't want to predict each note before i play it. i want to play the note that i predict. this is my main struggle currently. beyond technique and all.",
        "answer": "almost any exercise you can think of is probably good, but also be sure to balance that out with a lot of fun and good times usually what you'd do is use flats or shartps to show how it deviates from a major scale. so for example, 1, #2, 2, b3, 3, 4, #4, 5, #5, 6, b7, 7, 1 and of course for any of those flat/sharps you can choose between which way you want to do it (#4 or b5) depending on which one you prefer at that time i think you are doing fine. the brain cannot do otherwise than learn. over time, it almost doesn't matter what the strategy is. the learning happens. except don't forget the most important ingredient in music: fun"

Because of this, I've come to a hypothesis that my a lot of my recent creative block with music is caused by thinking about what other people will think about my music, because my block started around the time I started showing other people my music. Does that sound like a plausible hypothesis? If so, what do I do about it? Do I have to make a pact with myself to never show anyone my music ever? To be fair, I'd rather \"make music by myself and not show it to anyone\" than \"be afraid to make music at all\".",

        "question": "what is the root of a chord, and how would i find it? i imagine it as the note that i'd sing if i were to hear it, but that doesn't seem quite right... and what is an inversion? if C is CEG, then would the inversion be C, and then the E and G of the lower octave? but wouldn't that be a chord of its own? can a chord have two different names? also, how do i harmonize? i can't play chords in my left and the melody in my right and... have it sound good. just gotta keep playing, i suppose.",
        "answer": "probably more than half the time, the note you'd most want to sing might not actually be the root. if the chord is C major, the root of the chord is C. if the chord is C minor, the root of the chord is C switching the notes around so the highest or lowest notes are different, but otherwise keep the notes the same. so switch the octave of one or more of the notes you can invert it any way you want. put any of the notes in any octave. just be aware that if you have too many notes too low it will be harmonically useless and more like a horror sound effect, but that might be useful too in the right context sure. chord names are never 100% accurate anyway. the only way to describe a chord exactly is to list the exact pitches that were played -- in fact, even that's not accurate enough to represent the exact sound. the only way to exactly represent a sound is with an actual sound wave the next time someone sings the happy birthday song, try doing this: along with the final 2 melody notes in the song, you can sing above it. for example, if they are singing in the key of F, the last two notes are G F, so try singing Bb and A along with them. magic. To explore more possibilities and learn the mechanics, maybe the best way is to use a piano/keyboard and start messing around and see what you like"

        "question": "Usually I feel really happy and fulfilled by myself, living my life exactly how I want to - the freedom, the choice, it's all great. I feel happy by myself and rarely feel lonely. But then sometimes I hear other people talk about such a situation and person and even though nothing has changed I feel sad as if I'm reminded that \"oh I should feel sad about how my life is\" despite the fact that on the day to day I do exactly what I want to and enjoy it. It's not that I dislike other people but I don't want to make friends to not be defined as \"lonely\", if and/or when I make friends I want it to be organic and not forced. I don't like how stigmatized spending time with yourself (not just by yourself) is and even though logically I know that it should not be frowned upon and if you're happy that's all that truly matters, a part of my brain can't shake the feeling ofbeing judged and, maybe subconsciously, slightly judging myself.

It got to the point where she'd poisoned her brain so badly that her brain forgot how to stand or walk or even know where she was half the time. In 90 days of healthy meals and no alcohol, her brain has almost completely put itself back together. It's astounding. Alcohol is poison. It's completely insane that Jesus supposedly turned water into wine just so people could party harder and burn their brains out more. It makes me not like Jesus.

I get the feeling that there's a more efficient way to record but the all midi apps I've tried either were too confusing or they produced something that sounded completely different to what I was playing. Do you have any suggestions, or should I keep doing what I was doing?",
        "answer": "what you're doing seems great. you actually skipped a concept in between midi and microphone, and that would be direct audio (recording the audio through a wire, but still recording the audio output and not the midi). in which case you'd get the exact sound of the keyboard, not just the 'midi notes'. but it turns out, if you do that, you might find it disappointing that you can't hear the air and sound of the room, and, most importantly, the tapping sounds of your hands on the keys. also besides all of that there's another advantage of the way you're doing it which is of course that you are doing it. the other ones are in fact not happening, so they are pretty useless anyway in that regard"

        "question": "do you think feeling lost in life is related to decision fatigue? (where to go to school/work, who to hang out with, etc) is it fundamentally similar to being lost in a physical space like a really big park or new city? like whenever i get turned around irl i know i can backtrack or use landmarks to find my destination. but how can i do that for \"life\"? how do you even decide what the goal should be? i get overwhelmed and frustrated thinking about all the things i could be doing. there's no clear objective like finding my car somewhere in the parking lot if that makes sense. idk i know i should be doing something different but how do i decide what exactly that thing is?",
        "answer": "often yes could be well in that case you weren't lost. being lost is when you actually have no idea where you are, in relation to where you've been, or in relation to where you're going just start talking about it, and you'll start to sort it out. you said \"what should the goal be\" ... well, next maybe you'd think to yourself... \"what is a goal actually?\" \"should i have a 'goal'\"? \"do i want to have a 'goal'\"? depending on the answers to those, that will lead you to the next questions. basically you're just trying to get it down to one question at a time. if there's too many compounded questions at the exact same time, you actually can't perceive them, so it's just a foggy feeling. so you have to start sorting the mess of compound questions into something you can answer first. and the first several questions will usually just be about trying to figure out which questions you want to be asking there's no limit to the amount of ways you can decide. but a lot of those ways may also involve waiting for just a moment"

I cant really find anywhere on the internet that explains WHY, just that it is. If i throw a stone into the water, does it ripple sinusoidally? Why though? why not like a triangle wave? what is it about nature that makes it want to be siney? Is it really that way or is the sine wave just a good way to represent stuff? I saw an argument that it is used because its derivative is also siney but im not sure if thats it. Does nature speak sine or do we make sense of it through sine? I don't really know what to ask online to try and understand what void there is in my understanding of it. I know that it represents the movement of a circle, but does it mean that nature is naturally circular? and thats why when translated into one dimension we see sines?",
        "answer": "why wouldn't it i'm not sure. i actually hadn't heard about that. i've never looked into it, but i think i'd like to at some point my first thought is that transfers of energy into different vectors naturally happen gradually and not instantly. that's just my experience with acceleration, or just direction-change in general. however, that doesn't necessarily answer the question of why our universe is like this in the first place. although i've grown accustomed to it being that way and it seems normal. but i could also see it being normal the other way also. like how color changes in a photo are usually gradual, but you could also imagine a universe with only 2 colors and no gradients, and that would make its own kind of sense it's been said that nature speaks calculus. this may be tangentially related to your argument circles are natural, i'll give you that that seems solid, except i think you'd still have to call it 2 dimensions. but it's just perpendicular straight dimensions instead of the radial thing"

And I also realised just now that that could apply to everything, and there's so many inaccessible layers to people's art or what they say that I'll never get, but it somehow is still able to touch me so deeply -or the opposite of that case where people want to let you in to help you understand them better - and layers are neither opaque nor transparent, there's a spectrum of openness and closed ness and it's pretty darn crazy I have to say",

        "answer": "i don't think the experiments have to do with expectation. it has to do with whether or not you've actually checked to see what the result is. it also is not really a cat, it's usually just little bits of light. i suppose cats seemed more relatable at the press conference that's right. i think the point of this whole thing is usually that it's undecided which universe you'll go to, until you actually have directly or indirectly observed what result you got"

        "answer": "it seems easy enough to re-write the cliche starting with the actual ingredients you mentioned, and resulting in lemons. the only problem is, the cliche no longer has the repetition of 'lemon', so it might be a less catchy sentence. but more accurate. another solution would be to re-write it to involve another actual case where a naturally occuring ingredient can be used to make something else with a similar name. the meaning of the cliche remains authentic, that you can make something out of what has been given to you. although now, thinking it through, i've suddenly realized that the original saying actually still works fine, regardless of whether lemons were originally man-made or not"

        "answer": "i don't recall talking about that but i understand the sentiment i've learned it's mostly just a result of my mood when i'm listening, and therefore should not be taken as a binding evaluation or opinion not even close if i'm in such a mood where i feel it's bad, then it would therefore feel quite embarassing in that moment. and thus i would care on an emotional level, in that moment. but as you mentioned earlier, i can sometimes avoid this scenario by not listening to it"

        "question": "Hi, Bill Fair warning this may be a long and somewhat abstract question, and I apologize if this kind of question has been asked and answered before. I've been a fan of yours for several years now and enjoy many of your songs. The lyrics especially have intrigued me and sometimes puzzled me throughout the years. I've noticed in the past when folks have asked you questions about the \"deeper meaning\" to the lyrics of your songs you coyly respond with answers that read something along the lines of \"deeper than what?\". I'll admit, I once asked you a question like this several years ago on this pageand indeed received a similar answer. At the time I felt quite miffed, butthen I soon saw that many folks were asking this kind of question, and I believe I was asking the wrong question. You see, over theyears I kept thinking about this question I asked and your answer from time to time, and i think it started to make me ponder about the relationship that music artists can have with their songs, their fans; and the interpretation that their fans have of their music. I've seensome artists, when asked the question \"what's the meaning of song [X]?\", have a specific message in their mind they want song [X] to display, or perhaps a certain story they want the song to tell. In contrast, I have seen other artists not explain any specific \"deeper meaning\" to the songs that they make, and indeed these artists say that a song means whatever the listener feels they mean. For example, your song \"And The Day Goes On\" (one of my favorites!): I like this song a lot, and to me, the \"meaning\" of the song is to persevere and press on when life gets stressful or tough. However, I understand that others may not interpret this song the same way that I do, and it really doesn't matter to me how others interpret the song - I like it for what it is for me. But this does get somewhat to the crux of my question, and it's a hard question for me to articulate because I've never tried to write songs before. I'm not looking forcontext about certain songs, but I am curious in general about the relationship artists may have with their published work. When you write songs, do they ever have a certain \"meaning\" to YOU? Do you write songs hoping that your audience will interpret them in their own way and enjoy the song for what it is, regardless of what the song may (or may not) mean to you? Or is the process completely different? I'm curious about your thoughts on this idea. Thank you and take care!",
        "answer": "that's because \"deeper\" is a comparison word (the \"er\" on the end). like \"bigger, smaller\", ... etc, if you use the word, you have to say the other thing we're comparing it to. sometimes people just say, like \"is this lamp darker?\" .... so i have to say \"than what\" because i need that second object to compare to. it's very hard to compare something to nothing. or at least i don't know how to do it that's not how i react to the question -- almost every time, it's just the simple grammar conundrum, in the mechanics of the \"er\" suffix yes, and the final song recording represents my best attempt at conveying that. if you find me using actual music/audio/song/graphic etc, then you can be sure that words alone weren't enough. in fact, they're barely enough now, to answer this question. i almost need music just to answer the question. so i'd certainly need music to express the things that i've used music to express. in other words, it would be impossible for me to express what i've had to use music to express, without music. indeed sometimes people come along and say something like, \"can you express what you were trying to express in that music, except without using any music in your answer?\" and the answer of course is no or i wouldn't have needed the music the most profound meaning is certainly processed locally in the individual (within the mind of the person viewing/listening), so indeed it would be expected that everyone's peak meaningful experience might be slightly different. that's just the way it goes, in the 'feels' business"

I feel like the logic my brain is trained to use is incompatible with music. If you started on the 4 then wouldn't the listener feel like that was the beginning, and they'd expect you to go up TO the four?",
        "answer": "for example, Emaj7 Bmaj7, in the key of B no. just like you can draw a face with the nose drawn first. you can even draw the nose in the same place as you would normally draw the eyes, but then as long as you draw the eyes in the correct spot relative to the new nose, it will still look like a face and the nose will indeed be the nose again with the face example, say it's a face with dot eyes and a dot nose. let's say the nose is drawn first. in that moment, maybe you can't tell whether it's a nose or an eye. but then when the other 2 dots are put above the first dot, it becomes clear. in the case of 4maj7, 1maj7, once you hear both chords, it settles. even if you thought the 4 was the 1 for a fraction of a second when it started. also the melody helps"

        "question": "An earlier question of lyrics being like silent road trips sparked something for me and I really want to know what you think about it. In most situations where I've sat with a friend in silence it's largely because we're comfortable in each other's presence. We don't need to say anything to fill the air because we are just together. Nothing else is needed in that moment. While tension can exist in silence, doesn't \"what should we talk about during the trip?\" also create tension? regardless of when that's asked? It reminds me of trying to force something in a creative project that isn't there. or maybe isn't suited for that project. or instance if lyrics can't be found after so much is developed why try to add it in? It existed fine without it. Does it really need the lyrics to feel whole? Or do you think the project is asking for something different and unexpected to feel more complete? Challenging you to find a new solution if you will. Sorry if that was long winded I just found your response to the problem very intriguing and wanted to hear your take on it.",
        "answer": "i remember the question/answer being different than that. would have been the lyricless piece of music, that would be compared with the silent road trip in this case sure if i recall, the person said they had completed the production on a song with no lyrics, and then they ask how to go about putting lyrics in it. and my response was, generally, \"it's too late\". this may not always be true, because i guess it can be a neat challenge to add lyrics to a lyricless song after the fact, but generally this is not the way it goes for me. usually if there's words in a song, they gotta be written with the song, not after. i think you're asking a different question: you're wondering if that person's song might not even need lyrics at all. and for that i have no idea because i haven't heard the song, but it's also not what the person asked about. the person asked about how to write lyrics"

        "answer": "yours is a good question, but the other question is more of a rhythmic limerick than a question. so they can both exist separately maybe 'chuck' is a noun and not a verb, in this case. maybe it means an animal (a sort of 'chuck'), who lives around wood, or likes wood, or looks like wood, or something. and then maybe the limerick is achieving its kicks by playing around as if chuck were a verb instead"

I left a question half a year ago and after a while I believe your process of making work has rubbed off on me. You're a very inspirational person to me and you believe your advice on things have given me a better outlook on my work and what I should do if I have writers block or when I begin to doubt my work. So thank you Bill. 2nd half of this question. This first semester at college I didn't do so well. I have a tendency to do my work later which ends up making me submit them late. I understand the importance of college and getting work in on time. Do you have any suggestions for habit forming so I can quit the mentality of doing work later?",

        "question": "If all matter in the universe is just particles interacting according to the laws of physics, then there's no real difference between me and this table. We're just piles of stuff doing exactly what that stuff has to do. Everything I think and feel, even thinking about thinking, is just a bunch of stuff following a list of rules I have no control over. The only argument that free will isn't an illusion and that feelings matter, is that they feel like they do, which feels like circular logic to me. I think meaning logically has to come from an external source, but I don't believe in an external source. If the universe is a big rube goldberg machine, and we're cogs in it (albeit cogs with an element of randomness thanks to quantum mechanics), how do you derive meaning from it without just saying \"I feel like stuff matters so it does\"? Because then anything anyone feels is true. The statement \"nothing matters\" becomes just as true as the statement \"everything matters\". My brain hurts, my heart hurts, and I just want stuff to matter so badly. Your music is one of the few things that distracts me and makes me feel better, but you're so wise all the time that I want to hear your thoughts. Not like, telepathically, but you know, on here.",
        "answer": "i'm not following your logic there i'm not following your logic there either i disagree with that yes that argument would feel a bit empty 'who' doesnt so then it's safe to say that [whether or not things matter] matters very much to you indeed, if i'm hearing you correctly in my opinion, if this all-mechanical mindless cause-and-effect 'deterministic' 'no-free-will' thing were true, then we wouldn't be here to perceive it. we wouldn't even be aware of anything. so in my opinion the fact that you are here, aware of your existence, means that there is significant 'wiggle room', 'free choice', 'multiple futures which you can choose between', etc. If this seems bonkers, that's because it is. that's why you're here. if it weren't you'd be somewhere else. your bonkers consciousness has no business in a deterministic system. deterministic systems are already complete and the process of time is not necessary because all the results were already known. If you're looking for evidence of such bonkeristics in science, then you should check out how many different places electrons claim they 'could' be at any given moment"

Life events from the past have made me believe that no matter what I do, no matter how hard I try to build something for myself, it will never result in anything substantial.

It kills me Bill. \"Living\" life where I've given up my pursuit, my passions, makes me feel so absolutely dead inside. I know the things I want are achievable. I CAN take steps towards them today. But the trauma of my past has a chokehold on me. It's a cocktail of shame and fear that I'm not deserving enough. It feels like my desires, no matter how humble, are an act of selfishness. And because I'm selfish and struggled in the past, I still feel like I'm sentenced to suffer for the rest of my life. Dude, how do I even begin to let go of this? To have faith that overcoming this is possible? How do you pursue life again when you've been paralyzed for so long?",

Now that I'm really close to publically publishing an album, I'm starting to think I understand the reason why better perhaps. Even it doesn't apply to the majority of musicians, I'm guessing I'm not the only one with this feeling I currently have. I feel like i'm getting stressed that an unknowable amount of people, will be able to see the shortcomings that i percieve in myself. When I create a song, and only share it with myself, and people i trust, it remains really easy to just reflect on it in a calm and happy manner. I'm not sure i'll be able to do that once that music becomes public however. It slightly makes me wonder if i should back out of publishing my music.

        "question": "you've often made the point that it's not a good idea for a creator to make things that appeal to others and not themselves. how do you balance this take with e.g. the financial reality of artists? i was thinking about this with relation to art, and even a thousand years ago, a lot of paintings and music were made presumably for religious patronage or rich benefactors, and not necessarily at one's own creative whims. idk",
        "answer": "not quite, i think the point i make is that that's probably not possible, and it may be unwise to try. i sometimes say it would be like 'painting with colors you can't see' you can surely make things that other people like, by making things that you like, and then other people who have similar tastes to you will like it too. but if you are going against your tastes, then you'll actually have no idea what you're doing. again, like painting with colors you can't see. or baking with ingredients you can't taste. For example, you may notice that some other people like \"slime\" and you don't like such slime, if you say \"well now i'll just make slime, and those people will like it\", well, the thing is, those people obviously are seeing something in slime that you can't see. so if you try to make slime for those people, you'll have no idea how to make it because you don't know what they like and don't like about it. I just thought of a better example: let's say you are surrounded by people speaking a foreign language. you don't understand a word of that language: it sounds like nonsense to you. but you want to please the people who do speak it, so you try to write stories in that language. so you write the stories in nonsense because, to you, that's what that language sounds like. i think you see where i'm going with this"

        "answer": "to learn drums, in music, there actually might be something more important than owning a drumset and it's this: playing in a band for a live audience, where you are the drummer and thus are largely responsible for directing and guiding the rhythmic cohesion of the whole group, and hence the whole room. this is the part of drumming that i think will strenghten you in the way that you are looking for it's not something you can think about it. it's like knowing French, natively, then you start writing songs. you're not thinking about incorporating 'french thinking' into the songs, you're just writing songs which will probably end up having french in them because you speak french"

        "question": "in Nolan brewers podcast you said how its important not to think about scales when improvising like how you wouldnt think about letters when speaking and i thought that was a fascinating point, but then i wondered how you would ever improvise if you had no idea about what sets of notes youre going to use, like if the band is playing autumn leaves in F# and you start playing in C theres gonna be a problem. Or maybe you would think of it as playing what sounds good, in which case you could play notes from the F lydian scale if you were playing in D minor, thats how i would think of it, so if you dont think about scales when improvising, what do you think about?",

        "answer": "the question was most likely from december 2, 2023, at 11:58 am, and it said \"If you suddenly had to use a walking stick every day, what would it look like?\". and the reason i probably didn't answer it is because it evoked the idea of sudden back or leg injury, which was above the level of mental trauma that i like to subject myself to on the questions page. the reason you couldn't find the question in your notes is probably just because you forgot to write it down"

        "question": "I notice you seem to prefer traditional grip as a drummer, how did that come about? In my experience, traditional grip seems to be largely prevalent only in marching and jazz drumming, with marching snare drum, of course, being the origin of the technique. (As it so happens, I learned traditional grip first because the first kind of drumming I ever learned was marching snare, but I rarely ever use it anymore, I prefer matched grip for almost all applications I've encountered as a rock drummer, but that's probably entirely because I play a lot of rim shots, and I find those very challenging to do with traditional grip.)",
        "answer": "a basketball fell on my left middle finger in gym class, and for a few days i couldn't bend it. so i switched because you don't have to bend that finger as much. then my finger got better, but i didn't want to switch back as long as the snare is aligned right, i don't think there's any reason for the rim shot to be more or less difficult with either grip, except the main reason it will be better with one or the other is because it's what you're used to or just what you like better"

        "answer": "what is your right hand doing, what is your voice doing, and what are the hands instruments and voices of the rest of the people in the band doing there are many different roles a piano player may find themselves in. 1. you may be alone, singing a song and accompanying yourself with the piano. in that case, it's likely that your left hand will take the bass, and your right hand will take the chords, and your voice will take the melody. 2. you may be alone on the piano without singing. in this case you will probably be finding a way to generally cover bass, harmony, and melody, in various combinations of ways with whatever hands you can. 3. you may be in a small band with only bass and drums and piano. in that case, you will probably be responsible for melody and chords, in which case you will probably find your right hand doing a lot of melody (and some harmony) and your left hand lending some harmonic support where possible, and staying the heck out of the bass. 4. you may be in a band which includes a bass player and another melody player (or singer). in this case, again you'll want to stay the heck out of the bass, you won't need to be the main melody leader, and your main job will probably be just harmonic support. and in this situation, you'll probably want to be very careful about 2-handed playing, because most of what you need to do will probably be in a very one-handed range. if you insist on being very 2-handed here, you will probably be crowding the ensemble here 5. you may be in a band which includes a bass player, another melody player, AND also other harmonic players such as guitar. this case is similar to the above case, but even more delicate, and it's going to require some direct communication with the guitar player, to coordinate who does what. there's a lot of ways the 2 of you could ruin each other's lives, but as long as you are in communication then you can build exactly what you need, together all of the above situations are completely different roles for a piano player. this makes sense, because the piano actually contains the entire range of musical notes. so depending on who else is in the ensemble, you could be doing as much as everything or as little as nothing"

However, there are so many beams and flags on the 64ths, it's not too easy to read, and there's usually no reason not to just switch the tempo and use 16ths or something"

        "question": "is it normal to want to argue with people sometimes but not in an actual argumentitive way. like, just getting all of your thoughts out all at once without having to engage in a real conversation i feel like real conversations can distract from what i actually want to say sometimes. it's easy to misspeak or misinterpret the other person when speaking face to face, because you don't have as much time to process the information and come to a reasonable conclusion. maybe that's why i like text-based arguments better. you can get everything you want to say out, then edit it when needed to make the actual words of your argument match up better to your true feelings about it. but on the other hand, i feel like maybe the opposite of that is true in a way. maybe when speaking face to face, you're forced to be more honest. you don't have time to go back and deeply consider every one of the other person's claims. you have to make a snap decision on whether or not you agree with their argument as a whole. and maybe this forces you to be more honest about what those feelings you have are. and maybe it's also somewhat cowardly? to only want to speak in a setting that allows only you to speak. or, maybe not. i like having conversations with people online, i like hearing peoples' opinions on things. i don't think i don't like real-life arguments because they allow other people to argue with me, i think i just don't like being misrepresented in the heat of the moment, either by myself, or the person i'm arguing with. or maybe that justification is just something i've made up to make myself feel more comfortable about disliking arguing face to face. i don't know. i just think interacting with people in real life is exhausting. i wish there were a way to let people know exactly what i was thinking without having to deal with the social cues about when and how it is acceptable to say what i want to say. and having to find the exact words to say what i mean on the spot. but maybe that's just life. it's certainly a skill i don't have right now anyway what was my question again? oh, whatever, what's your stance on doors",

        "question": "So, I know that if you multiply or divide a positive number by a negative number you get a negative number, and if you multiply or divide two negatives, you get a positive.... But I remember learning \"that's just how it is\", and I can't really conceptionalize what's actually happening there... Can you maybe help me to understand what it means to multiply or divide a number 'a negative amount of times'? Multiplications means \"the repeating addition of groups of equal sizes\"... So -2 x 3 means that I have three groups of -2 that I am adding together... -2 + -2 + -2, which is -6... And I know that if -2 x 3 = -6, then 3 x -2 must also = -6 (symmetric property or whatever that's called)... But what am I actually doing if I have 3 x -2??? Like what is actually happening to that 3 to get me to -6? 3 x -2 means that I have \"negative two groups\" of 3 that I am adding together? How can I have \"negative two groups\" of something? And then why would having \"negative two groups\" of -3 give me a positive 6? I think I'm confused because negative numbers don't truly exist as quantities. You either have some of something, or you have none of something. There's no such thing as a \"negative amount\" of something in real life. I can have no (0) hats, or I can have 1 hat, 2 hats, 3 hats, etc. But I can't have a negative amount of hats. So how can I multiply/divide a number by a negative amount of times? In this case, isn't the negative number being used as a quantity?",
        "answer": "you add up two negative 3s 2 groups of negative the thing maybe it would help if you thought of 'negative' to mean 'opposite'. going to the opposite side of zero, on the numberline maybe you could think of them as directions. for example, if you go East, negative 10 miles, this means you actually go West 10 miles sure, but you can have a change in the amount of hats, and this number can be positive or negative. if you have 2 hats but you used to have 5, you can say you have negative 3 hats compared to what you had before. you'll also need the negativity concept if you have debt. for example, if you have -3 hats, this means you owe someone some hats, so even if you aquire some hats later you'll have to immediately give them away before you get to keep that 4th one, bringing you to 1 it's more like a direction"

C to G# is an augmented 5th, G# to C is a diminished 4th. C to F is a perfect 4th, F to C is a perfect 5th. C to Gb is a diminished 5th, Gb to C is an augmented 4th. if all goes well, this might raise more questions, but then answer even more"

        "question": "you mentioned in an earlier question something along the lines that for the most part, instrumental music tends to be made in service of a video game, movie, etc. but i listen to plenty of instrumental songs made independently from any other media form. i was wondering if most of these songs actually serve the title of the song, which is usually where the idea/message comes from in my experience. then again, there's plenty of cases where the title/message/music dont really line up. could you elaborate more on your thoughts on instrumental vs lyrical music?",
        "answer": "ah yes, i was expecting to hear from you i had more examples of things that instrumental music attaches to. but for brevity i only mentioned 2, but yours would have been next on the list. for example: you could be listening to instrumental music produced and delivered as just music, (and not produced as a soundtrack to anything), then, it's likely that you are aware of the identity/persona of the artist, such as name, what instrument they play, and maybe they even have a nice photo of themself on the cover, perhaps with the instrument. as you listen, you are aware of the person, almost like the way a movie star would star in a movie. so in that sense, the artist's persona is what anchors the music. Or, in another case entirely, maybe you are using the music as background music, and in that case it might be part of a broader collection/library of music, maybe even in some context where it doesn't matter who the artist is. In this case, being background music, the anchor element will be whatever you are actually doing in real life. Or, even more enchanting, would be if someone else picked the background music for their own location, in which you are a guest. so if you are in a store and there's music there-- this can enrich and enchant your experience in that location, and, in turn, your experience in that location will help anchor the music. you may even think back on that situation and feel great adoration for that song, meanwhile actually your experience of being in that store will very much help to anchor those feelings. If music actually were not connected or anchored to anything or anyplace in any way, then technically you wouldn't even be able to recall where or when you heard it, and possibly would have no memory of it at all"

        "answer": "it's probably because i write the song from beginning to end before going into production. so in that way i guess it's more dilligently constructed to an exact blueprint, but, the blueprint itself was made freely, without the burdens of production"

I never really completed anything, because i never know what kind of medium do i want it to be in the end. has that ever happened to you? i have a lot of unfinished stuff laying around and i don't know where should i take them. I don't think i can do all of the stuff i like about music at the same time or can i? i never really found a passion as big as my passion for music, so i don't know if i should study to get that 'safe bet job'. got any advice for me?",

I feel bad that the person is upset, but I don't feel sorry for what I said. And if I apologize to someone I want it to be a genuine apology and not just \"Oh, sorry that you were offended\". For context (and this sounds silly in retrospect)... my friend had jellybeans and she said she did not like the black jellybeans and I made a very dumb joke that was \"Oh, wow, that's racist\" and her response was to get all downtrodden and say \"I really don't appreciate you calling me racist. That's not cool.\"....then the rest of the day she was giving me the cold shoulder... Like,ok, it was a dumb joke. But, obviously (or at least I think it's obvious) I do not actually believe that someone is racist because they don't like black jellybeans. That's (to me) clearly not a serious accusation of racism.",

However, i have to also mention the elephant under the rug here, which is that in saying that i prefer these 12 (or 11) keys equally, i'm also saying that i also stick to A=440 tuning. now, in terms of freshness, it would actually be much much better to throw it somewhere else. but on the other hand, the reason i keep it in 440 is as a courtesy to practicing musicians who like to noodle along to their playlist and then get fucked when something like 'beat it' comes on, for example"

        "question": "I would love to create accurate (that I'm happy with) chord tabs for some songs such as Money, La De Da, Alphabet Shuffle, etc. It's something I enjoy, and your songs are all so rich with unique harmony and complex chords. However, the RECORDINGS often include many random-seeming notes which make the chords much more complex, making it harder to make what I feel is a \"definitive\" version, a.k.a. a sort of \"prototype\" of the song, or how you would write it in your own mind before adding all those decorative instrumentals. My question is, do you usually come up with all those crazy chords right away, or do you start simpler (limiting yourself to maybe m9 or 7sus4 at the maximum complexity, for example)?",

        "question": "how do I tell people about jazz?",
        "answer": "you could start by telling them about the popular dance/music crazes of the 1920s. then describe a few of the other disparate plotpoints the name has taken, over the century. mention some examples of different musical trends, over the course of the century, which have had the name 'jazz' affixed to them. basically just go right ahead and bust the myth that 'jazz' has anything to do with 'jazz' or 'jazz'. the only common feature to all these is just that 4 letter word. which i'll admit is a cool word, phonetically. the word has outlived any coherent meaning"
