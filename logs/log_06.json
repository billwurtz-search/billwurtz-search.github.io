        "answer": "i typicaly go through the 12 circles of hell, in order, one by one, and then i am informed that i am supposed to go around another time, and then once i get done with that round i discover the next circle after that which is labelled \"14th circle, circle of success\" but the problem with that is, because there is no circle labeled 13, the one labeled 14 is actually the 13th. which is the circle of failure. but because i think it's circle 14, i actually stay on it until i have forgotten about success and start to enjoy failure, then i venture to the next circle hoping i may find more failure, unexpectedly arriving at the circle of success around feb 2014 is when it really started working for me. since then many different schedules have succeeded and failed, and some of them have stayed around for quite a long time it requires a level of extreme reasonability, juxtaposed with extreme ambition. a combination that is almost too paradoxical to ever exist yes"

        "answer": "i liked it so much from such an early age, and it made a frightening amount of sense to me, at an extremely early age, so when you put those things together it gave me not only a frightening advantage very quickly but also made me like it even more and made it nearly effortless to spend days weeks and years on end exploring. which only gave me more ways to enjoy it and continued to strengthen my advantage year after year. i am aware i may not be a typical case, but that's the only way i've ever known"

        "question": "hi. i submitted a long question a while ago about how i am ashamed of having an obsession that makes me only want to listen to music by a certain person. i still feel ashamed, and sad, especially when i'm in a music voice chat, because if i queue the songs i REALLY want to listen to, i fear it will seriously bother people, because the only songs i'll have queued are from .. one single person. i feel like i'm weird for it, or creepy maybe. i'm not sure. you told me if i needed to spend more time with that certain material, then i should spend more time with it. ... i just wish i could stop these guilty feelings from appearing. it's not as bad when i'm just listening to my music alone, but in certain scenarios (like when i want to listen to music when i shower) those guilty thoughts pop up more and more. should i be guilty for this? should i continue to follow your advice and just ignore these feelings? i can't tell anymore. i hope this isn't too stupid of a question, and i hope all of what i said makes sense. thank you so much for doing what you do",
        "answer": "it will always be difficult to let others to find out about what you listen to, because we all experience the world through our own custom reality tunnels. theirs might be currently oriented much differently from yours, so they might not see/hear things the same as you. but, in the bigger scheme of things, i think if these problems are tearing you apart then it's probably a sign that your life in general is going very very good, especially when compared to the life of the average earth citizen"

        "answer": "it was kind of the last instrument i learned. also kind of necessary, unless i wanted to rely on another person to deliver my musical dreams. at a certain point i got serious about it and started recording myself playing keyboard / singing, on an extremely regular basis. none of the technical 'breathing' advice (or any other technical advice) ever made sense to me, i knew it was probably good advice but i was never capable of following it. breathing is too linked to thinking (not like thinking about your breathing, but like when you think about other things, you breathe based on your thoughts). one thing i discovered very quickly is that the only good moments i was ever able to achieve were when i was improvising the lyrics. the singing suddenly became good (sometimes) when i did that. similar phenomenon to why improvised acting always sounds so much more genuine than scripted (unless the actor has some kind of magical miracle technique, which some do). but the other thing, separate from that, is just simply the more you sing the better you get. and then of course when recording written material, i can do as many trillions of takes as i want and edit with an iron fist. and still in time you get better just from doing it. so that's pretty much how it went, and then particularly during 2015 i improved quite a bit from doing all those vines with singing in them. but sometime around 2018 i suddenly started to think i had damaged my voice, because there was a certain scratchiness that would keep coming back, and i realized that i had probably been pushing too hard to get certain high parts, on cycle mode, just hammering away at really hard takes, over and over and over again, etc.... and i also heard a rumor that 'clearing your throat is bad' (this is actually true) and i had NEVER known that until last year. and that is something i've been doing it all my life. so finding out it's harmful made me very concerned. i got my voice checked by a voice doctor and he said it's fine. but a few things i've learned since then, which have helped a lot: first of all, i have trained myself to stop clearing my throat (was difficult for the first few days but i quickly got used to it). my recording technique changed, i now do much fewer takes at a time, and i actually sit down and edit on the spot, and throw out what i don't like, which gives me a chance to rest and it also makes the process much faster. this was also necessitated when i made the dramatic switch to the 2 week process from what had been 8+ weeks, but it not only helped the speed tremendously but was also much better for my voice. and the other change i made was i started doing this repeatedly (up a halfstep each time) over the course of a 10-15 minute morning walk. it became such an instinctive habit that i actually do this now unintentionally almost everywhere i go"

OR, on the other hand for example, if your desire to do 'complicated' actually came from a feeling of excitement you had by SEEING a very complicated looking piece of music on the page, then i would suggest you go through that piece and learn all the notation in it, and then get a blank page and start to put all those notational pieces together in a very complicated looking order"

(this should work very well for most of the songs). let me know if this works for you"

        "question": "I don't know much of anything about music theory. But I can compose tunes pretty easily, and I can very intuitively tell when some series of notes are good, or when some are bad. I've come up with this idea of composition that models songs/melodies based on the attention they gather from the listener (attention being used, for lack of better word), which seems like a promising way of writing/thinking about songs. A part of me wants to ignore modern music theory and reinvent the wheel as a means of making more unique music, another part of me says that maybe that's a bad idea. These parts of me are getting very upset, and they're calling each other VERY rude names. Can you help settle the dispute?",

        "answer": "go through about 50 of your favorite songs, and identify them with brute force. quickly unpause/pause (or nowadays you can edit to loop a tiny fraction of audio very quickly) and just pick it out note by note and put it together. write down all the chords to a song (in time, with bar lines, etc.)..... once you do this for about 30 or 40 songs, i think you will find that you don't have to search for the individual notes anymore. ... maybe not even pause it at all. After about 100 more songs, you probably won't even have to listen to the song, you will be able to do it from memory. after about 1000 songs, you will probably be able to hear someone singing the melody for a song you have never heard before, without hearing the chords, and figure out what the chords should be. after 10,000 songs, you should be able to play along with them on the first try, never having heard the song before, and have them think you already knew the song"

        "question": "i had an anagram-related ethical dilemma yesterday and was wondering what you'd have done in my situation so i have more insight next time something similar happens. i was recertifying my first aid training for the 1939545th time and i was bored out of my skull, so i took a pen and the little manuals they give you and started writing possible anagrams next to the chapter headers. there were lots of wild ones, but i think \"bone, joint, and muscle injuries\" ---> \"boner juice slut, join me and sin\" was my favourite. but then!!!!! at the end of the course!!!! THEY ASK FOR THE MANUALS BACK. nobody told me that would happen and the manuals have always been ours to keep at every other certification i've ever attended. so it's like, do i return this and never train with the first aid company again (i have very distinctive handwriting that matches the handwriting on my registration form), or covertly try to steal the manual? i tried the latter but a classmate saw and gave me a dirty look so i ended up returning it and shoving it into the middle of the pile. i still don't know whether that was the correct decision. my worst fear is that the next person reading that manual won't realize the anagrams are in fact anagrams, and will just think i wrote \"boner juice slut, join me and sin\" over the chapter title for no reason. anyway what would the best course of action have been? do you have any advice for future similar instances of this? thanks",
        "answer": "you should put a bracket around the source text, explain in a slightly different font \"re-arrage these letters, to get this\" and have arrows pointing accordingly. i think anyone reading that can surely be greatful that you've just shown them a pleasingly good time, high brow at that"

That way you can still post content regularly even if ur not done with your medium projects and maybe have less pressure that way. And when you're out of short/emergency material spend again 2 weeks making some. Ofc try to use the emergency content as less as possible. Btw this also can be a future solution for a large projet, making a lot of short content and releasing them at a very slow pace while making a big thing.

Like I am constantly experiencing impending doom that something will happen to them, or that they might be going down the wrong track or things like that. Other things too, but it's mostly my family for some reason. my fear isn't entirely unjustified either. I feel like the only escape I have from this is to be creating something, which is kinda cool but should creativity really be used as a crutch? I don't mean to think of it in this way but I kinda can't help it and it's causing a block I think for quite a while (because my natural default is to create and it's been happening less) I don't try to make things for this reason alone (or at all), but it definitely is nice to escape into abstractland. Is this normal? Should I be wary of creating for this reason? Should I create less? Should I create more? I dunno why I'm asking you you just seem pretty cool and btw don't mind the guy who asked about the self help questions, I think you are just doing a good thing for people. Thanks.",
        "answer": "isn't that more like a staircase you could use abstractland constructively. it is an asset sure too late, you already created a huge amount already just discussing your fears probably not possible just try to aim it in some different directions. create some new farms. ...... etc"

        "question": "I have basic video editing software that I have been using to make videos for my music. Problem is, I find the way I use this software to be not unique to me in style. I use it to layer colors and text and images and such. I know I am very inspired by you, but I don't know if what I am doing is copying you or just doing what I can with what I have. It bothers me that the word copycat is being used by some people to describe how your style might be influencing others. But I dont know if it's bothering me because i know i should feel bad about not having an entirely original video aesthetic or if the word just doesnt seem fair to others who are doing their best with tools. Making the music takes time, making the videos takes time, somehow this way of making videos just feels so intuitive. Like it's the most effective and efficient way to make content that is of some quality. I'm not sure how to feel about it. Would you advise me to steer clear of this way of editing? I get a bit panicky when I think of turning up the different dial because I dont know how to conceptualize another video style that feels like it has quality to it but doesnt take forever to make (using only my simple tools). Am I screwed? Part of me does feel bad because I feel like if I'm good enough I should know what to do about this problem.",

I mean I make out everything anyone does or says or anything I do or say or anything anyone makes to be something powerful enough and big enough to change the world-but people tell me that's not how it works, that I can't change the world, and nothing else really can either. Well if that's true, what's even the point anyway? And if it's not true, and every action you take has the potential to change your life as well as billions of others, how do you take the right actions? Thabks.",

        "question": "Hello, I have a question concerning synchronization of sound and images. You make text appear when the lyrics are said. Sometimes I edit films and I find it hard to synchronize a sound and a visual precisely, espacially when the tempo is fast. Sometimes I need to anticipate the sound by 1 (or 2) frames with the image, but sometimes it feels off. Sometimes I try to do it by just hitting spacebar when it is the right moment to put the image, but i'm not quite sure of this method. What is your experience regardning this aspect of editing? Are there some software that make it more intuitive, for that particular issue?",
        "answer": "put it to the exact frame. make sure scrubbing is on, so you can hear the audio for each frame. it sounds like you are already doing this, based on the fact that you said you know you are putting it 1 or 2 frames too early. putting on the exact frame will be better"

        "answer": "this is similar to what i went through, because i am working from the same starting point as you. but you will already be better after 1 month. and at 2 months you will be a little better. and at 3 months you will be better. so the 'baseline' you are working with is actually right now, that's your starting point. 2 months from now will be the middle. unless you stop singing entirely after 2 months. for specifics on technique, for some reason no professional vocal technical advice ever made any sense to me until many years later, and much of it still doesn't. i found that the voice is so deeply connected with life itself that it was almost impossible for me to think directly about most of the things professionals tell you to think about. so i had to find much more abstract tricks. one of the most important tricks i learned was to improvise the lyrics. and for scripted material, try to do it like you are terrified of joe jackson whipping you"

        "answer": "what i would suggest is use a random number selection to determine which one you do next, and just start selecting ones and doing them. you can keep doing this for several days, but it is not necessary to do the entire list before doing anything else. you can continue to do this regularly while also working on other things"

Or you could think of it as an abbreviation for C(b7) just a weird quirk of the history of the language. kind of like \"doubt\" has a silent b, or how 'invaluable' actually means valuable. oops yes but in this chord symbol language, if you just say 9 it is assumed to include the 7 also. Cmaj9 = Cmaj7(9). Cmin9 = Cmin7(9). C9 = C7(9) it means do it with no 7. but i think the one you mentioned might be more normally called add4"

Also, make frequent trips to a rehearsal studio with drums already there. you can find pay by the hour places in any major city. but if you really wanna get on the hyper-speed learning bus you're gonna wanna get yourself into a band that gigs regularly. like anything. churches, weddings, church weddings, funerals, church funerals, convenient stores, convenient store funerals,"

        "question": "4.26.19 10:16 pm One big thing I've learned from you is to take my work seriously and become a librarian in terms of not letting any ideas fall through the cracks and keeping everything organized. This has been a huge help for me because I'm starting to be very encouraged by a huge growing library, and also starting to see some patterns and directions in all these little ideas, and all this helps me come up with new ideas to fill in the gaps. The part that I'm having trouble with though is the part where I'm supposed to work on a song and \"don't switch to a different one until you've made significant progress\"? Another fun issue that I've been dealing with for years, is re-writing songs. When I do go back to try to expand upon old ideas and fragments, I wind up making changes to the original idea and not adding anything new.. Sorry, this is long.. but I just wish I had more finished 'products' to show for all my little ideas and stuff.",

        "question": "one of my biggest problems when combining melody with chords is that ending a melodic phrase by going M3 -> 1 is one of the strongest sounding melodic resolutions, but the strongest harmonic resolutions I know (V7->I, bII7->I, iv6->I) all do not work well with the M3rd of the tonic chord included (at least when the blending is clear enough to hear the dissonance). I know V13 is a thing, but I always think that sounds weird unless the 7th is lower than the 13th, which usually makes the chord sound muddy. The best way I've found is iii with the 5th of the tonic scale in the bass, but that never is quite as satisfying as I want it to be. Do you have a go-to for this situation? I know in And The Day Goes On, you just did a I chord with the 5th in the bass going to a normal I chord with lots of voices moving down and it totally worked there but like iii/5th it leaves me with a bit of harmonic blue balls when I try to apply it in general.",
        "answer": "if you are really saying the 3 to 1 melody is the strongest thing around, then surely you must have Heard it somewhere. how was it done there? i can't tell which part you mean you mean Emin over G, or Emin over B? if Emin/G to Cmaj feels too lame and weak, you're gonna want to swap out the mid-range G for F. so you have G bass, then F B E over it. that's G13 but maybe you haven't tried it that way? that can be made crunchier if you also add Ab in there. that might actually remind you of the 1930s. but none of this means anything without the entirety of what else is happening in the song. most songs are not just those 2 notes, no words, etc"

        "question": "4.30.19 10:27 am It's like how you have several parts of your brain (limbic system, frontal lobe, occipital lobe, etc.) and even if some of them act independently of the others, \"you\" are still \"aware of\" what they do (create emotion, make judgements, process vision, respectively). And, in the case of, say, the occipital lobe, even if the neurons never receive signals from each other directly, the lobe is still \"aware\" of what the neurons do (aware meaning affecting behavior. In this case, what the neurons do determines how the lobe behaves, i.e. what it communicates to the other parts of the brain, and so we say the lobe is \"aware of\" the neurons' actions. Same applies for part of your brain affecting \"you\"). The ABC scenario is a just simple example of this Russian-nesting-doll of consciousness, where higher levels are aware of the thoughts of lower levels, but not vice-versa. My theory is that, just as a human has independent parts yet feels like a single experiencing mind and not like millions of tiny neuron minds, so too may there be a higher level of consciousness that feels like me and only me, you and only you, Benedict Cumberbatch and only Cumberbatch, \u2026 , and perhaps some non-person thoughts exclusive to the higher-level-consciousness. That's what I mean by everyone is everyone else. By the theory, we are all just one entity that experiences many localized, I-am-me-and-noone-else perspectives. Of course I feel like me, and you feel like you. But that feeling of individual identity does not mean that our experiences are not just the thoughts of one single entity.",

Remind me etc. would be from key of Db, then from World was younger is from A, so that's 2 more changes there. TV on radio is definitely from Db, then around Stereo/leaves, we're in Bb, then landing on Turquoise we're back in B, so that's 3 more changes. 'Fly around on an airplane' sounds like it would be part of a song in E, then 'business class sec' would be in G, so that's 2 more changes. ants crawl is still G, then the next chord i could make a case for either E, A, or D, but regardless it's definitely a change. then B (turtles.) then on \"streets\" i would argue Db. and just linearly up from there (Eb, then F, then G.). so that's 6 more changes. then somewhere in the midst of 'church holds the key' it slips into C, so that's 1 more change. Then it goes to garbage land on the last line in the chords, but, the melody is still in C so i don't call that a change. so that's 16 changes if i counted correctly, according to what i think counts as a key change. using for sure 9 different keys, at least"

        "answer": "really fast maybe, maybe i'd watch all of 1. but i can't watch all of them all just keep searching and searching and searching and finding things that are 'ok, but i wish i had something better' etc, and eventually i might find something good enough. or sometimes i just start putting graphics on something that i didn't think was that good, and i can sometimes make it become good. or, sometimes i work from a list of things i've gathered when i was earmarking certain things, having done some searching perhaps at a previous more leisurely time yes. when originally going through in 2016 from the beginning (and making the almost the entire 2010-2016 catag), i felt obsessively the need to get to every file, i had up to triple speed playback (adjustable as listening, to catch whatever), and skipping over blank spaces. got pretty good at it, but still it was taking multiple weeks just to get throught the material and bookmark. weeks and months were flying by during this process. so eventually probably around when i got to the 2014 videos (that would be sometime in april 2016 i guesss, having started the project in early feb 2016) i made the decision to start severely skipping files. just sort of going 10 days apart maybe, and clicking into them. Also sometimes deliberately searching for specific important points. this is where it can be an advantage to not do the editing until years later, because then you know what turned out to have future significance and you can assemble more rewarding plot points"

The person who made that dramatic piano song has more of that stuff, and every musician ever has stuff of there own style, and that's the beauty of it. People don't need to force themself to do a certain style, because other musicians will be doing that style. People can cover what they want to and/or capable of. And just because I can't get my music into the style I look up to, doesn't mean I'm failing, as people have complemented my music before, and as long as I keep going I will get better at covering my style of music",

        "question": "5.10.19 8:02 pm - Okay then, let me show you these words which will convey the virtues of albums. Me personally, I view albums as more like a book or a short story, where each track is a particularly memorable sentence from a chapter that sticks in your head, or a plot twist/intriguing moment or something like that. The whole purpose of an album in my opinion is to create a story that's bigger than just one song could provide, or rather tell one story but with a lot of nuance and detail to it. Instead of taking them on a short journey with one song and trying to pack as much as you can in there, with an album you can give yourself time to think and breathe and tell as much as needs telling and in the time it takes, y'know? Not tryna invalidate your approach to \"musical storytelling\", but that's the angle I tackle the music-making bull from, anyway.",
        "answer": "right, but if you're really gonna put any good amount of twists and turns in it, wouldn't it already be much more than an album?"

All the albums that really are worth the candle and aren't just \"compilations of songs\" already do that, at least in my eyes. Take Daft Punk's Discovery for example, or Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope. Albums that have so many twists and turns that to share only one song off of it at a time is kind of doing it an injustice. THAT'S a sign of a good album - when you need someone to take in the total package rather than just a singular song. It'd be like taking a chord from a song and just playing that rather than the whole song; sure you can do it, but to get the whole scope of things, you need the entire track. An album should be like that, I feel.",
        "answer": "seems like it could be better if it had a little more non-song content to fill it out. at least enough so that calling it an album would be a stretch, and it would be better off called a 'movie' or 'story' or at the very least a 'musical'"

        "question": "Hmm, I think found a really nice place to add a new chord, but I just can't seem to find a chord to fit at that moment. I'm trying to make the chord using the first note of that new bar, but the chords I'm trying just don't sound right (maybe it's just me). Do you have advice on figuring out a chord for a particular moment?",
        "answer": "just add 1 note to that moment, in addition to the note that's already there. like in happy birthday to you, if it's in the key of C let's say, ... let's pick the very last moment of the song, \"you\", a 3rd above. (sing E in harmony with the C note on 'you.') but don't take my word for it, try this one in your spare time"

        "answer": "i think that's browser specific, but to do the vine files properly you need to have a very specifically timed loop, certainly tighter than that, probably cutting off several frames to make it line up right, and have a sophisticated buffer system somehow so it can be sure to be timed right on all devices. this isn't that important for non-song vines, but for the ones that are musical loops (q train, letterman, etc) it's essential that the loop is clean so the beat stays in time"

        "question": "5.15.19 11:35 pm i dont understand why that second part would be true if there have been very great albums that we still call albums",
        "answer": "that's fair, i think it just so happens that i don't like any albums, aside from the songs they contain. i have yet to hear one that seems to actually aquire any special quality due to the order of the songs. i've specifically gone searching for this on many occasions, i used to trust that it must be true, but after listening to so many of the most famous albums that are famous for being *great albums*, i actually have unilaterally failed to see anything special about the album as a whole, and still feels like at best it is just a bunch of really awesome songs, and on every album i've ever heard (in proper order) that i can think of, including the ones that are the most famous for being *great albums*, almost every time i still feel like at least some of the songs are in extremely the wrong order. i actually think songs probably go best in different orders on different days, unless you are able to do additional craftwork additionally going far beyond the music, to set up the songs to guarantee it's the right order. to do this i think you'd surely need at least as much connecting tissue (audio AND visual preferably) as could be found in a stage musical, at least. i don't see why you would want to do LESS than that, unless you are really just doing songs. no one seems to ever get what i'm saying on this but that's ok. i live alone"

        "question": "It occurs to me that the confusion over the idea of an 'album' is down to a lack of agreement with regards to definition. I think you take the term 'album' quite literally, almost as the term photo album, i.e. a repository for a set of only loosely connected items. Most of the people arguing in favour of a Bill Wurtz album see the album in general as a sophisticated artwork that, in its most successful cases, has not a single note or word out of place and was conceived as a thematic whole, like a novel or a movie, and not as a random selection of songs. All the great albums are apparently random selections of songs, that reveal their inner logic and consistency only gradually, sometimes after many years. Pet Sounds and Rubber Soul fall into this category. You yourself have already made one total masterpiece of an album. Its most satisfying tracklisting (for me) runs as follows: 1) Alphabet Shuffle 2) Outside 3) And The Day Goes O n 4 ) at The Airport Terminal 5) Slow Down 6) Hallelujah 7) Hello Sexy Pants 8) Mount St Helens 9) La De Da De Da De Da De Day Oh 10) Long Long Journey 11) I'm Best Friends With My Own Front Door 12) When I Get Older 13) The Moon Is Made Of Cheese The new album is also shaping up well ( Might Quit, Just Did A Bad Thing). I'm also not overlooking Christmas Isn't Real: it is my personal favourite of all your songs, but perhaps too high-concept to integrate easily into an album. You have lifted the single song and video package onto the level of art form almost single-handedly. Pity us older music lovers who are still attached to our 45 minute programs, preferably broken into two halves. The album was our guiding principle, our mainstay, our educator and friend. No movie or novel (or music video) could ever approximate its awesome depth and breadth of vision. Only the truly great managed to master it as an art form, most crashed inexorably on its treacherous cliffs. Indeed, if you set out to create an album as a work of art you may already have shipwrecked. Its easily the most confounding mainstream modern artistic discipline. It's a shame it is really dying. Perhaps it is already dead?",
        "answer": "i am the wrong person to ask about this, because i simply never connected with that format. i also try desperately to avoid dwelling on the feeling that a certain art form is 'dying' because it just seems to abundantly clear to me that artforms are thriving and being born at each and every moment, just as enthrallingly and eagerly as they ever were"

It has become quite popular among french speaking persons, but I will never reach international audience. I tried to write in english, being the language of the internet I think, but it's less natural, it just doesn't flow. I wonder if I should just force myself to create in english all the time (the more I do it, the more it becomes natural, right?) or if I should just stick to what comes out of my mind naturally, closer to the music on ma native language. I know the audience shouldn't be a goal, but still, I'm traveling more and more and I always find this frustration of not being able to share my work because of language. Any thoughts about my case?

        "answer": "let's see, it starts in G, there is a small hint or borrow from another key on \"grey\" but i really don't think that's long enough to call it a key change. then it doesn't change keys until the first bridge, which starts in Eb for the first half, then from \"vacation\" it would be in F (this is 2 key changes so far) then \"paying them etc\" would be in Ab, then back to G for the next verse. this makes 4 key changes so far. during this 3rd verse, it does a similar key slip that happens in the first verse (different key but similar place), but it lasts slightly longer than the one in the first verse, just long enough to declare it a key change maybe depending on who is judging that day. then back to G. so that makes 6 so far. then the second bridge, again to Eb in the first half (7 changes so far total). then on \"sun burns out\" there could be disagreement on which of those is considered a key change. i feel on 'sun' it seems like we are in Amin for just the moment, then the following chord actually feels like it's coming from the key of Cmin, which i would consider the same key as Eb. so i'd think that would be rude to say it changes to Amin and back for just that 1 chord, but then again on \"sun\" there is a distinct change. on the other hand, you could argue that they are both coming from the key of C, nah fuck it i guess you have to call that 2 keys. fine so we'll call that 2 key changes for \"sun burns out.\" (that's 9 so far) but you see where this creates chaos in the courts because we've just allowed a single chord to be called its own key, twice in a row. so then it's only fair that we allow it back at the beginning also, for \"grey.\" so that makes 2 extra changes because you'd have to count the change back also. so let me re count, that would be 11 so far, then from \"sky\" all the way to \"goin down\", that's all in Bb, so that's 1 more change. so 12 changes so far. then the top of the next verse stays in Bb but quickly slips to G, then the rest of the outvamp is in G which makes 13 changes if you include all the single chord incidents, and maybe 10 if you are more stubborn about including those"

(that's how you know this method is working .....) then, after watching for a couple days, try to recall which ones made you the most excited, and follow those. they will probably work, as long as you choose the ones that made you go \"yeah!\" and not the ones that made you go 'meh'"

        "question": "Hello! I come from a very cut- throat high school that only cares about their students' GPA and their GPA contributes to whether they enter a good college or not. Coming from this environment, I felt a constant pressure because I was surrounded by hard-driven people that applauds when they see another person's rank goes down so they can move up. Well college decisions released, and unfortunately, I did not get into the college I wanted and for these past few months I felt very worthless because I kept comparing myself to those who got into my dream school. Most students in my school got in and some I question why and how and I started to fall in this wormhole of depression where I think I was not enough compared to other students because my dream school did not accept me whilst they accepted many others that I thought did not care enough about school. I just feel like the whole world is against me because now I would go to school, ashamed to share the college I'm going to and hearing EVERYONE going to my dream college. Everywhere I go, I hear them getting into my dream college and I am truly happy for them, but it just feels like the whole world is ridiculing me. How can I stop this negativity cluttering up my mind? I know this is so unhealthy for me, but when you are constantly reminded of your failure, how do you cope with that? I really wish you see this because no one around me has the answers and I just feel like I am alone in figuring these things out.",
        "answer": "a couple of things it is important to remember. 1. college/university education is rapidly losing credibility out in the real world. in other words, as we move into the modern era, it matters less and less to anyone whether or not someone has a university degree. or 2., maybe you feel envious because you think it will socially and culturally be some kind of golden magical time. and that may be true, but as an alternative can i interest you in becoming a traveling poet"

        "question": "i have seen two points. one point arguing that destroying every particle in your body and then reforming it would kill the 'you' you but give birth to a new someone who is entirely you and to their knowledge everything continued as normal, but the 'you' you is really gone. The other argument is that this new exact rearrangement of particles is you and would be the 'you' you and everything is fine. I have a hard time with each one but i think i lean towards the idea that the 'you' you won't be there anymore more when it is reformed. i think this idea for some reason blends in with my thoughts about reincarnation. i also think there are extra problems to the situation like, what if when your particles are reformed they form 2 or 3 copies? then, if 'you' you are still around, which one is you? are both you? would it be like a clonal colony hive mind kind of thing? that doesn't make sense to me and damages the argument that 'you' you would be around. if everything is happening, perhaps what we are experiencing in this life happens infinite times. if it does, do 'i' really get to experience that many times? it doesn't feel like that. unless this is the first time and i am in for a big whopping surprise when i die. these things have just been really burning into my brain. any thoughts? thanks for listening. i hope the new video is bringing meaning and joy.",
        "answer": "i think this automatically happens to all of us. there is a persistent rumor that says our entire bodies entirely regenerate themselves over the course of several years, implying that you are now a completely different physical body than the one you are born with that would be a mindfuck but we would probably all learn something eventually probably because the possibilities are so vast, it's probably impossible to imagine currently"

But if you are in there for 2 min and then someone says 'ok you gotta start doing flips man' , .....that could be a little risky if you don't know what the room is all about yet. by room i mean the song. once you know a song well then you will be able to take care of the song, and then do all your back flips, and you'll know all the twist and turns of the song so you'll know when you gotta be home by. if you know the song then you're gonna know when and where you have time to have your feet not be on the ground. if you don't know where those bumps are, you could jump at the wrong time and everyone will fall in the river"

        "question": "I feel as though you embody a nice balance of both groups in this example: The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the \"quantity\" group: fifty pound of pots rated an \"A\", forty pounds a \"B\", and so on. Those being graded on \"quality\", however, needed to produce only one pot \u2013 albeit a perfect one \u2013 to get an \"A\". Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the \"quantity\" group was busily churning out piles of work \u2013 and learning from their mistakes \u2013 the \"quality\" group had sat theorizi ng about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.",

I realize it is a good business decision to do the video with the music, but dude... you can't do this forever unless you're really happy with it. I mean, you can, but keeping up with making the videos to go with the music is going to slow down the whole songwriting process, yes? I don't know what you will do - keep it as is (the old 2 week schedule), change it up a bit, do away with it entirely. But I can say that if I were in your shoes, with the same fire in my veins and the same passionate drive for songwriting, I would drop the videos. Or, at the very least, alternate between music with no video, and music with video. I really can't speak for you, but from what I can see, you seem to want to complete multiple lifetimes worth of work! If that's the case, you've gotta be quick :)",

        "question": "6.16.19 5:33 am - Thanks for answering this! I find it amazing how you can break this stuff down so easily. I've been playing music pretty consistently for around 15 years and I still couldn't nail what was going on there, especially the A+7(#9). Any tips on how to get better at breaking stuff like this down? Do you literally rewind, listen, rewind, listen, until you've heard every note you think you can hear? Or does your perfect pitch give you the means to pick it apart super quickly?",
        "answer": "experience with songs do that when starting out, then after you've done 20 or 30 songs you will start to get what's going on. after 2000 songs you will even be able to predict what they do next not even close. absolute pitch would actually be more of a distraction from anything musical"

Do you think that the concept of existing will cease to exist one day? (by that I mean that there will be nothing left: No humans, plants or animals. No outer space. No atoms. No electrons. No particles. Nothing.) We will eventually die and go extinct, our planet Earth will eventually get destroyed, the sun will eventually explode and die, so why should the entire universe last forever? If the universe does die though, will its death last forever? Or will another big bang occur after some time? If the \"nothing lasts forever\" concept is true, that could mean that the concept of nothing existing would eventually end, and a concept of something new existing would take its place. Y'know what I mean? This \"nothing lasts forever\" thing is making me realise that we are/might be stuck in this constant loop where eve rything is going in out out of existence all the time. The process of it might be slow, but it's there, it's real... or is it? What are your thoughts on this entire thing? ((((I'm really sorry for bothering you with this!!!))))",

F major chord is these notes: middle C then F above that then A above that. G major chord is these notes: D right above middle C, then G above that, then B above that. You could switch these notes in any order but I've given them to you all staying in a reasonable range. so sing the song through in the key of C (starting on the note C for the first note of the song) and then see which chords of those 3 chords you think feel the best at which parts. see which ones seem to make the song sound the most strongly like itself. should be easy and fun, at least it was for me"

        "answer": "it's sort of a fun and never ending game. a neat exercise would be to write a play where each person thinks they're better than someone else by catching the other person thinking they're better than a 3rd person. then the realizations start hitting everyone, and their self images all begin to oscillate rapidly between good and bad. put the characters in a variety of everyday situations while this is happening. endless fun"

        "question": "well, i gotta ask. what's going on that you haven't heard before / seem like mistakes in the Mario Bros. 2 Overworld? i presume it's in the first two lines of chords since the rest is pretty standard",
        "answer": "what really made my head explode upon a closer listen, there's 2 things actually. when the bass hits the F, F#, G, A thing, that's like the most cliche figure in the world and it's been in 1000s of songs (especially american 'jazz' popular sort of songs from the 1930s and 40s i suppose?) (and also many nintendo games) and the chords are F, Fdim, C/G, A7. it really blew my mind to hear that the A note on the Fdim chord actually had F natural harmonized under it. that was the worst offender. it just HAS to be F#. now, it's easy for me to sit here and complain, but i must admit, from experience, in some cases you may go in and make it what you think it's supposed to be and it just doesn't work. Sometimes you see these paradoxes where the bass will do it the twisty way and the melody will just completely ignore the twists and do it straight, and for some reason it just works fine that way when you breeze through it. it's one of the great mysteries of life. The other issue, which was a little bit less disturbing but yet still defied all norms of the 'genre', is the A7, which in every fiber of instinct feels like it was supposed to be A7, and the harmony note should have been C#, but in reality they used C. this is not nearly as big a 'crime' as the F and A notes over the F# bass, but yet still common sense and experience of the 'genre' still begs that to be A7, at that point in the song. It really makes you want to wonder if there is some technoligical restriction at play, preventing us from having any melody or harmony notes outside the plain C major scale set. but this is disproved if we take a look at the other section, on the D7 chord, we have F#s right in there. The only other thing i MIGHT be inclined to hypothesize is that the melody and harmony line were written and programmed before the bass was there? and it was planned to be less 'jazz' and more 1, 4, 5 triads. then when the bass came along there was somehow a decision to go more 'jazz' and yet the harmony was not changed to match the bass. This is unlikely and doesn't match nintendo's reputation for perfection especially in these types of genres, they usually absolutely nail this stuff. or again to restate my other theory it could simply be that upon trying the 'correct' 'twisty' harmonies there you would expect, it might have just not sounded right. one of the great mysteries of the universe, but sometimes that is the case. BUT, without constructing a sound-alike and testing for myself, my current hypothesis is that it does weaken the song at those moments to have the notes in there the way they currently are, and i do believe it would be stronger if those were sharped. but i am only about 85-90% sure, short of actually constructing a sound-alike and trying it at tempo and in context"

        "question": "There are too many songs so how do i pick which one to record",
        "answer": "first put them all in a list. then, go through the list from bottom to top and choose as many songs as you want. be generous, choose songs you would like to record 'eventually.' once you have that second list, don't delay, it will be temping to do round2 and narrow it down to dust until there's nothing left, but don't. count them quickly, and go to random.org and get a random number (set range accordingly) and set it in stone as fast as you can. don't even look up the title just yet ..... just write down the number and let it sink in that your decision is made, and was healthily balanced between random and genuine. This is a summary of many years of negotiations i've had between the 2 ends of this spectrum"

        "question": "I have this thing I'm creating and it requires a large amount of knowledge to complete. Of the tasks that need to be accomplished to finish this thing, I (at this moment) only have the skills necessary to complete about 20% of it. Due to advice received from other people, I've spent the last 4 months trying to work with other people who have the other 80% of the skills I need and as a result, I feel like I have wasted the last 4 months of time I could have spent working because I'm no further along in the process than I was before. Each time I find another human who I think can contribute, I end up moving backwards. I think this is because of a few things. 1) they're only focused on what they will get out of it monetarily (which is fair and also achievable with this thing I have begun to create, but their focus on money rewards doesn't accomplish anything). 2) they wait for me to spoon feed the creative process into their brains to fill i n incomp lete holes in the vision instead of trying things themselves. 3) If they do make anything, they protect all parts of it instead of submitting to the creative editing and improvement process. The world is telling me that at some point I will just find these people and that if I keep asking everyone I meet for help on the project, I will eventually finish the thing. BUT. I'm really starting to think that this isn't true and that what the OG creator is telling me is that I need to do this alone. I need to spend the time teaching myself to do the other 80% and then just do it. Now I'm wandering my house feeling angry that this is something I have to do by myself. I really like other humans and it's hard for me to believe that I alone can make something as incredible in real life as what I'm seeing and hearing in my head. Because this is going to take a really long time. And I'm already lonely. But I gotta do it. And I'm crying. Cause I'm scar ed. And it's so much work. Is the next step to teach myself all those other skills? And then once I have an approximate idea of how to use the tools, I start making whatever the best version of the thing I can. And then I start showing it to people? Is that right?",
        "answer": "yes but i might suggest not doing the biggest project first. things will flow so much more smoothly if you can integrate the doing and the learning. learn a bit, do a bit. try learning and doing at the same time. the part about working alone, yes, you are absolutely right, you must work alone. that part is true. i remember the pivotal moment my life was changed when i found out that some people are actually built to work alone and it's ok. all it took was to hear an important artist come out and say that's what they do and it's just how they are. then i started looking around and found quite a few other people who are the same way. many many people do great in groups, but, it's important to recognize that many people also work alone. there are advantages and disadvantages to both. disadvantages to working alone are insanely bloated production time, and your brain eating itself. but the advantages are off the wall"

        "question": "6.25.19 7:28 am so, lets say I have a chord made up of the following notes: F-Ab-C-Eb-G-Bb-Eb-G. Having grown up playing music from classical notation (treble cleff and bass cleff) I think my instinct is to split it up as F-Ab-C-Eb in left hand and G-Bb-Eb-G in right hand, so I kind of memorize the two blocks by themself. But once I move to another chord lets say G-Bb-D-F-Bb-C-D-F, I would split it into G-Bb-D-F on left hand and Bb-C-D-F. So instead of memorizing 2 8note chords, i memorized 4 4 note chords, and it always made sense since it felt like memorizing smaller chunks would make it easier. The thing is, when moving from first set of 8 to second set of 8, the checklist becomes twice as long when trying to make the change fast, since I have to run the checklist of 2 4 note chords as opposed to a big one. So my mind is split making sure I got the left hand right and then the right hand right (and with the memorized finger positions). So let's say I have a less than ideal memorized way of placing my fingers on the notes because that's how i first came upon them, then I would just be repeating my mistake everytime simply because thats how i memorized the 2 blocks. But on the other hand if my \"mental check list\" goes note by note from the bottom up, then my hands might fix the mistake the second time i play by going \"ah, that makes more sense how my fingers landed on the notes this time around\" and instead of memorizing how to place my hand on them, my hands start learning finger placement instinct in a sense, and i have more mental space to do/think other things. I always thought it was easier to memorize both blocks because, lets say for the second 8 note chord I could memorize Gb7 on left hand and a Bbadd9 on the right hand, both on root position. But I am coming to the realization that seeing them this way may intelectualize the process too much and make me think of music in more math/pattern terms rather than feeling the music. As for the puzzle part, if i just play the right notes and not worry about which hand does which, the hands slowly start gaining instinct of how to play what. And everytime you play them, you're figuring out the finger-placement puzzle again, or atleast starting to make the connection of both hands working as one as opposed to LH does x, RH does y. Another advantage I believe is that when changes need to be made to the voicing they are made to the whole at the same time, and rebalancing voices in the other hand to fit the change becomes easier. Because you don't need to relearn both blocks again and/or how they differ from the previous version of the chord, you just need to solve a new puzzle when playing.Mentally it feels kind of like the first time I started seeing the harmonies in classical music as opposed to just learning the notes and the order they come in at. Way easier to play bach's prelude 1 if you know the chords that are being arpeggiated rather than learning/reading each note by itself as it comes. I thin I am slowly unhindering myself of the limitations of the way I learned to play music as a kid. It just always seemed so intimidating to me seeing people improv 2 handed chords over changes and I thin perhaps they weren't thining of them as 2 separate blocks one for each hand, but as one whole thing. The other advantage to not seeing it as 2 hands I believe is that it's easy to say, well that chord needs one less note, and just play the chord and let the fingers figure out who plays who, as opposed to trying to keep balance or saying \"well, there was 4 and 4, now theres 4 and 3, i should probably take one out of the left hand too to make it balanced\" when the balance perhaps doesn't lie in number of notes in each hand but simply what the music needs, which might not always makes sense in the pattern/balance-seeking frame of mind. I hope it makes more sense or atleast shows what I'm thinking better. Tl;dr, \"Gb7 on left hand, Bbadd9 on right hand\" turns into G-Bb-D-F-Bb-C-D-F. First one might make more sense for writing down/analyzing, second might be more instinctive and wont rely on having to make sense of each hand as an individual chord. Like, on the example of the first chord F-Ab-C-Eb-G-Bb-Eb-G, itd be hard to categorize G-Bb-Eb-G as a recognizable chord, perhaps some sort of Eb in first inversion with a doubled 3rd on the top but I want to let my ears do the listening, my fingers the playing and my mind the enjoying instead of intelectualizing it. It may seem I'm saying the newer way im doing it is better but I think maybe it just complements something that's been lacking in my approach to music thus far and a balance must be found as opposed to committing to one way or the other. I find the mind of a piano harmony improvizer intriguing and I hope this new approach makes it less convoluted in my head. It just seems like itll be way easier to improvize when im not trying to first make two independent hand voicings and placing them together as opposed to thining of a big voicing spread through all my fingers (and let them do the chosing of which plays what note as opposed to summoning up some finger positions from the catalogue since my catalogue may be too limited atm. It feels like when playing with this new frame of mind, it's easier to try new stuff and let the music speak to me. How do you approach memorizing/improvizing voicings when you are writing/arranging/playing?",
        "answer": "seems a little thick for 1 chord .... everything about that feels frightening and all wrong to me, but to each their own i guess where are you getting these chords from? what world are you living in? oh no oh no this is all wrong does your keyboard have sound? make sure you are checking how these things sound because what you are describing sounds frightful just for some perspective, i've already mentioned that i think you are living in a completely alternate universe from me, and that might be ok, but, generally if I see Gb7 on the page, the basic go-to way i would play this (not taking any context into account), and if i am the only instrument (not a band) i would play 1 note in the left hand and 2 notes in the right hand. Left hand is bass note Gb (let's say the 92.5hz one) and the right hand is playing Bb and E (233 and 330). depending on context and what key the song is in etc etc you might need a little more (maybe add Db in between) but that voicing would pretty much be the standard for me. If i'm in a band and there is already a bass player there, do the same thing but skip the bass note i think you are overestimating the existence of 2 handed chords. if you are using 2 hands for a chord, your hands should either be very very close (like in the same range) and hopefully not playing more than about 6 notes max (beyond that it just gets crazy dense ... if you add more notes, they should be on the same notes you're already playing. which means other instruments have to play them) OR, you have a chord with your right hand and 1 note in the bass range. but only do this if you have absolutely no other bass player in your group oh you meant Gmin7. the example i gave before was for Gb7. --- Gb7 actually means Gb dominant 7 i've really never memorized anything of that sort. most of the learning i've ever done with regard to keyboard / chords / fingering, etc, has been a result of spending a very very long time with the keyboard in a deep state of experimental enjoyment. also i will mention again that this default idea that both hands are supposed to play a chord seems all wrong. the only scenario really where i think that would be a good idea is if you had 2 keyboards and you were playing them right in the same range and at least some of the notes are the same. the magic range where harmony/chords work is generally very small (within about 1 octave range). when you spread out, at least on the low side, you'll want single notes only (for bass range). and if you are talking about spreading way up higher, still i think you are going to find that this \"each hand plays a chord\" idea is just not sound. at least i think that's what you find when you start really paying attention to the sound"

In one of your reality vids from 2011, you said that in the past you've thought that there was a way to get songs perfect, and you followed that up by saying that \"perfect is invisible\" and that it's \"perfectly empty, abscent, etc.\". I'm not quite sure what you meant by that.. By \"perfect is invisible\", did you mean that perfection exists merely as a concept/ doesn't exist in the real world? Because that's what I got from it. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, I'd really like to hear your explanation/take on that phrase of yours.",
        "answer": "no for example, if any note were perfect, you'd want it to never cease"

        "question": "6.26.19 7:39 pm when i say G-Bb-D-F-Bb-C-D-F I really mean a voicing made of those notes bottom up, not each chord per letter. I was gonna write g-bb-f-d-bb-c-d-f but b for flat with non capital letter felt b for ti felt weird. I dont know if that makes more or less sense. And i did call Gb7 something wrong. I think its the Gmin7 with a \"Bb add9\" on top. so really a Gmin7 add11 with doubled 5th and 7th, but revisitting it it should be a Bb something, as so the F something should really be a Ab something. and yes i do agree these are separate universes, but i wont let that excuse me from doing things in a perceivably wrong way(regardless of how thick i want my supersaws to sound). I get too sidetracked for beefiness that I may be overdoing the voicings and cluttering the arrangement (and missing the tonal center). Highly truly appreciate you taking your time to go over my rant and bring obje ctivity. Now I have another point of view(and way more experienced) on my voicing approach or atleast cataloguing. Sometimes it feels like im working on a vacuum but im super grateful and lucky to be able to bounce these things with a way more experienced skillster to atleast have a sense of where the needle might be pointing as opposed to letting my subjectivenes or missfocus from sidetracking me into a least-ideal place. I hope my follow up made more sense and had less mistakes at essential points. . So the 2 chord thing i was describing once i take your advice into consideration would be something like Ab bass (the F at the bottom was really unnecesary, its really some sort of Ab) with right hand doing g-bb-eb, and then going to G bass with f-g-bb-d on right hand. How do you chose what to leave out when using many tensions on chords? Or it's a feel-along excercise with the theory behind the played voicings being an afterthought to analyze what was done? Upon yet ano ther revision my last version would be Ab (207.65) and on right hand g(392)-bb-c=eb which would translate to Abmaj7add9, and then for second chord Bb on bass (233) and then on right hand f(349)-bb-c-d. which would be a Bbadd9. Does it sound like a more balanced voicing? I did have a weird keys patch where i was jamming with it but going to a normal keyboard sound makes it clearer to hear what im doing instead of letting the reverb disguise the sound. It seems like by your description your instinct would be to go for bass on left and guide tones (3rd and 7th) on right and then alter from there?",
        "answer": "i know ah, much more comfortable experience, knowing the songs, knowing what sounds happen when you use different combinations of notes. the only way to really learn is to spend a lot of time with the instrument, a lot of time with songs, and general life experience. you will even find yourself gaining experience in stores, when you hear something on the radio that seems great but very much on the high side. your bass notes are around middle C. this is cool, but if you are generally in the meat of the arrangement, your bass notes are going to be an octave lower (probably 2) and the right hand parts would be maybe half an octave lower. i'd say a nice happy range for your first chord (speaking in Hz again, cuz it's the only way to truly say which octaves we're using) Ab 52, and chord would start from Bb233 and up. a good range for the other one would be Bb 58, and C D F starting from middle C and up. that's always cool, if you don't know the song yet and specifically what it needs where. also it's good to practice shuffling the range around so the chord/harmony generally is situated around the middle C range. that's just where all the harmony wants to be. i think the more music you check out, the more you will find that that's almost always where the actual harmony is taking place. you may have many instruments helping out, but there are never actually that many different notes being played. the harmonic content is really usually in the middle C range and slightly above. that's just something that i've found over time. when you hear a dense arrangement with a lot of instruments, i think you'd be amazed to find out that there still aren't that many different notes being played, there will be a lot of instruments playing the same notes (layering)"

        "question": "you said you we re going to change the editing software you're currently using (I won't specify but I'm fairly sure I have worked it out correctly). If so what to? I would go for either final cut pro 10 or premier. I know you can replicate your style on any editor, but I spoke to a guy who did a really good replication of your editing style on FCPX. Also, when you make your text, what effects do you use, I technique i use when i try and make editing like yours is to create multiple copies of one word/sentence in slightly different places, and use different blending modes on them, i also animate it by adjusting parameters on a setting i have called earthquake. Could you help me, I'd really appreciate it.",
        "answer": "one of the good things about this transition is that it has made me more aware that the main software i was using is something that actually should be more of the final step. at this point, it is more important for me to have more animation centered software. for many years i've been kind of attempting to do animation on software that really doesn't do animation subscription pricing makes me want to jump off a building. but then again, the transition from fcp7 to fcpX invokes a very high amount of anger and bitterness. fcpX just feels so much like it's made for family vacation videos. even though i know it is very powerful (probably even more), it's just incredibly hard to escape the feelings of anger over the fact that the software you've used for 10 years has been deleted and replaced with something completely different with the same name. like they could have at least used a different name (iMovie Pro would be the perfect name). were they actually trying to trick someone? i think i've used all of them at some point, but it's a lot of custom made tricks the thing about earthquake effects that always bothered me is you can't slow down the frame rate it uses. i think it always looks like crap at the full frame rate. actually i was never using the 'pro' version, i was using 'express' this entire time. maybe the pro version had a speed adjustment for it. but my process for dealing with the earthquake thing was to actually to export and re-import and then speed adjust to 25%. and if i have multiple words appearing to be timed properly, i would make the sequence, increase speed to 400%, export and reimport, put on the effect, then export and reimport again, then speed adjust to 25%. but usually with that i use 2 different layers, 2 separate earthquakes, and also use overdrive on one of them (that also requires the speed adjustment trick, because it seems to look like crap on full frame rate, example, see 'print out my feelings') and then also use blend modes between the 2 layers, usually difference for that one. and then juggle it around until it's good. then sometimes export and re import that. actually, starting in mid 2015 or so, exporting and re-importing was kind of my secret weapon for getting things that look like they're way beyond the capabilities of the program. that's true for a lot of art forms. you can do it with sound too. put a bunch of stuff on something, then export it and reimport it, then mess with it more. then export and reimport that and mess with it more. that's really the trick for getting the 'how did they do that' look"

        "question": "Hey Bill. I've started studying jazz piano this year. It's something I've always wanted to do (I have decent piano skills, but never took it very seriously). I'm extremely lazy and my teacher is also useless, so I haven't been making half as much progress as I could have. I've come to realize that I'm never motivated to practice, and I've been wondering if I really like jazz all that much. I'm still more interested in singing, producing and arranging in other genres (things I've done before), so I could prioritize that next year. I've especially grown an interest in guitar-based music (and find myself listening to it more than jazz), and maybe learning to play the guitar. But at the same time, I feel like I just need to push through, because like I said I've wanted to do this for a long time, I really look up to jazz musicians, and I need to finish what I've started cause I can't keep doubting my goals and not working to accomplish something...

        "question": "6.28.19 5:10 am First I'd like to say in regards to 6.28.19 5:10 am , I think my core confusion was that more=better when voicing (and then being too indecisive to know what to cut off for fear of dropping out anything \"good\" by dropping anything out and taking more=better to the extreme of 4 notes per hand for beef purposes, and somehow perceiving the chord root a third below where it was supposed to be for one of them, perhaps because i was voicing stuff so high that I didnt have a grounding bass sound, not trying to make excuses, just trying to pinpoint my mistakes and the core belief behind to more efficiently improve. Anyways back to chord talk.I really like that bass 2 octaves below, I find i rarely try going around those ranges when playing in my midi keyboard and it can really do a loooot to beef up smaller chords that may be playin g on rig ht hand. For some reason when I do go that low I usually double that octave but through listening to these clear examples i can see how it can actually unbeef the lowest note. Because if the patch im playing with say has any vibrato, tremolo, or even chorusing or other dsp, by doubling the octave you wouldn't necessarily get that extra punch at the desired frequencies because there'd be way more noise (noise as in many more frequencies besides the fundamental, not really all-frequencies-noise) because of the nature of timbre and that could muddy up the low end. I just realized my 61key midi keyboard doesnt go below c(65). When trying out the stuff you mentioned i put it an octave down and will be able to jam at a happier harmonic space. Going with your Ab 52 example going with chord starting at Bb233, I like doing Bb C Eb G and trying the second as u suggested with Bb 58 and C D F starting at middle c. Do you think you stray away from also playing Bb right below middle c wit h your r ight hand because of the most reasonable note to fit in a happy harmonic place within the context of the current notes is the root and its already in the bass? Trying to reason out when 3 notes might do a better work than 4 (again fighting against my now aware bias towards more=better). I thought i might add some more chords to those 2 to practice and get your thoughts with a bigger context so this is what i came up with to get a complete harmonic idea. https://imgur.com/Dx5oEck Now, i'm happy with all but my first chord, the thing about the first chord is that I have an alternative way, by removing the Bb. I like both but this is when my indecisiveness/whelm for possibilities/overthinking starts. I like the 4 notes on right hand as its the first measure and maybe it reinforces the one, but at the same time i think Bb could be better off not there for several contexts. To have a clear one, lets say we're singing never gonna give you up's f irst ver se. I also like Bb but no C. these would be the 3 variations im deciding between: https://imgur.com/3gKUMvN. I think it would make more sense to remove the Bb and keep C on the first chord and leave the 4 chords like this: https://imgur.com/mGJT4lj but tbh i find it hard to decide mostly because of indecisiveness and fomo on the other possibilities. Would those last voicings make the most sense to you? I really like the other 2 voicings but I'm not 100% sure of my choice of voicing it as Cmin with Ab bass (to make a Abmaj7) I was wondering to what degree would context have to change for those 3 to be usable or the most optimal for specific contextual situations in your opinion? Is my choice the most appropriate for a Rickroll reharm/voicing? I hope im not misusing/abusing the questions page. Highly appreciate your input and you taking your time.",
        "answer": "actually doubling a bass octave is usually pretty safe, and doesn't really change the harmonic information much. anything else besides an octave, will be mud town. a general rule of thumb can be discovered .... whatever the lowest single note is that doesn't sound muddy, (let's say it's the lowest C on a 5-string bass, which is about like 32hz or something), i think you'll find that you can octave double that just fine without mud. and the next thing you'll find is that the lowest you can really go safely with a 5th interval is right there in the next octave: C64 and G98 will work fine together, and pack seemingly the same *girth* as the low C. and just the same, a fourth at G98 and C131, will be about the lowest you can take a perfect 4th before it starts to turn to mud. just the same, for the major third, the lower limit will be right here at C131 and E165. following just the same after that, the lowest limit for the minor third will appear to be right there around E165 and G196. none of this is a hard set in stone lower interval limit (these are called LILs in some social circles) but you can notice that they are easily a function of the harmonic series, which is what happens when you take a note and keep doubling the frequency. that low C (32), then C64, then G98, then C131, then E165, G196, the next one is actually a weird half flat 7th, and so on etc etc. interesting phenomenon but the point is that the lower you go, the more simple the interval has to be or else it will turn to mud, and then if you go too low then only 5ths will work and then if you go even lower only single notes will work, and if you go below like low B or maybe A? even single notes turn to mud. i personally think it's more like B. the lowest note on an acoustic piano is A and i really can't hear a note there, it sounds like a noteless grind you'd be fine if you played them both at the exact same time. the vibratos should be syncronized usually those ones have octave switchers 1 octave down is a friendly place to be on a 61 key keyboard if you are playing by yourself and you want to take care of the bass. super cool if you get a bass split, then you can play with just a drummer and a singer and it's almost like you've completed the band. takes some practice but if you throw yourself into a situation where you have to do that, you'll sprout wings! like jumping off a cliff. very fun yep, i believe that's the photo in the dictionary you should see next to Abmaj9 a fun secret of chords and chord playing is leaving out the bass note. sometimes if you want that extra thickness, fine you can have it, but i actually find when i'm playing by myself and i am covering the chord and the bass, i play the bass note in the right hand almost 0% of the time. actually much easier the think that way. there are a few cases where i do use it. and now that i think about it, most of those cases where i do use it are cases where there are still only 3 notes in the right hand 3 notes in the mid range, plus a bass note, is super great. 4 is super cool too. if we were to start listening to every song on the planet in random order, and go through and check how many notes are in each chord, in the mid and bass range, i'm pretty sure we would find that by far the most common case is 3 or 4 notes in the mid range, and 1 in the bass. that even includes the melody super classic. reminds me essentially of \"you are everything and everything is you\" and hundreds of others. this means you're in the key of Eb by the way. start playing melodies in Eb and you'll see that i mean. songs with these chords always have the melody in Eb yep well remember, you don't even have a melody yet. like you're making a movie, you've designed the entire set, and now you are worring about which flowers to use, but you haven't even looked at the script yet. let's not get ahead of ourselves. What's the scene about! only then will it matter which direction to point that little flower oh that's right, it's those chords ah, 3 more dictionary-like photos. of Abmaj9, Abmaj7, and Eb/Ab (\"Eb over Ab\") yeah, for that first chord it just depends how dense you wanna make it. which in this case will partially depend on what textures you have. but in general, the Abmaj7 will sound 'dreamy/longing', the Eb/Ab will sound more \"shiny\", and the Abmaj9 will of course be a hybrid of the two situations yeah, and it's important to remember we're splitting hairs here before the actors have even arrived, so to speak seems totally cool to me, but no one will know until someone has read the script. i.e. knows the melody and the lyrics i think in the rickroll song you'll need that dreamy C note under there and the Bb would be optional in terms of shine but most likely i think it would be Abmaj7. i'd bet on that being what they used. specifically i'd venture to wager that there is a good chance the G note was only in the vocal. (this is pending transpositions of course) also this is a good time to mention if you haven't tried this, do this same sequence but keep the bass on Ab for your second chord also. like Bb over Ab for the second chord. this would be exactly the \"you are everything and everything is you\", i think you'll recognize this cliche tear-jerking ballad sequence, which seems to have originated in the 70s (i think?) but can be heard well throughout the 80s and 90s and even today. especially in those sappy 'i miss you dearly' sort of feels. i think you'll recognize what i mean right away"

        "answer": "my standard advice for this is to try doing projects of a smaller size. if you are still having the same symptoms, just try even smaller projects. keep reducing the project size until completion is easily and handily within sight. i think you will find a lot of newfound excitement in actually completing something for once! and you will actually learn a lot very quickly. it's like when you first walk into a new house, you walk through the entire house once. even if you don't do anything in each room yet, just walk through each room. Now you know how big the house is! and you generally know how it goes! very powerful information, will pave the way for bigger ideas in subsequent episodes"

        "question": "i remember watching a late night show video where a guest was being interviewed and at some point they quoted a song i think and started singing it in whatever key, and after a few seconds the band joined them in that very key. how does this happen, is there like a player with absolute pitch making some sort of gesture to the rest of the band or does each one start playing very silently until they find the key (i don't remember if there were any wrong notes at the beginning)",
        "answer": "even if you don't have absolute pitch, you can get away with it. all you have to do is flick a note, and you'll immediately know what key everything is in. the other players may also do the same, and/or if the keyboard player finds the key they can tell the other players. if all the players know the song, then that's great. if they don't, they can fake it using intuition and try to guess where it's going to go, and/or make ambiguous decisions until they get it. also what is quite common, if the keyboardist knows the song better than the others, they might say numbers or give number symbols with one hand. you may never believe this, but i think all the skills necessary to do this are actually skills that are not particularly common among people with true absolute pitch. absolute pitch may help you find 1 note if you're in handcuffs, but in terms of finding the chords and the rest of the song, it comes down to musicianship/music, which is quite unrelated to absolute pitch"

The video made me realise that I should definitely learn more about music stuff, so I decided to download a free demo version of some random music theory book today. The book thing introduced me to basic music notation stuff first. I was doing fine and having fun until I came across tuplets/grouplets. I just straight up had a short crying session because the darn thing blew my mind (in a negative way). Like, how are you supposed to divide a whole note into three half notes??? A whole note is worth 4 beats, and a half note is worth 2 beats. 3 times 2 equals 6, not 4!! I'm so confused?!?! I just wanted to have fun!! I've even watched some videos regarding this topic, but I'm still not quite sure if I get the hang of it. I did try to make my own definition, but I think I might need your help with improving it. It basically goes like this: \"a tuplet/grouplet is a group o f multip le shorter notes used as a substitute for a single longer note (for example a group of 3 eighth notes can be used instead of a single quarter note)\" . Does my definition make any sense? How would you explain tuplets in your own words? What's the most important thing to know about tuplets? Also, where can I find really good examples of tuplets in songs? Thank you a lot in advance!!!",
        "answer": "write 3 half notes and put a big number 3 above the whole thing right. the 3 is a cheat. 3 is actually short for 3:2 which means \"3 in the time of 2\" a good way to start is with the most common case: 8th note triplets. 3 of those will fit in the time of 1 quarter note. you distinguish this by putting the number 3 above them like this (sorry for messy, new computer, no new pen yet. old pen does not work. need a new pen) that's the way it's normally written, but, to be more precise, it's actually 3:2. (3 in the time of 2.) but because that's so common, people just write 3. You can do this with any note value. another common way to see it is like this. that's 2 16th note triplets and 2 regular 16th notes. the 2 16th note triplets are occuring at a 3:2 rate which means there's 3 in the time you'd normally have 2. Sometimes you might see a group of 5 16th notes under a number 5, like this. this doesn't happen too often, but i think you can generally assume that the 5 means 5:4, and those 5 quintuplets are taking the space of 4 16th notes. but you can know for sure by looking at the rest of the bar and seeing how much space they take up. Usually the only time you'll see the : symbol being used is when it's a strange/uncommon situation and you need to clarify the ratio. actually the most common place i think you'd see it is if you are in a 6/8 time signature, which kind of makes normal 8th notes behave like triplets, because there are 3 per beat, with no number 3 written. So if you want to put 4 notes per beat instead, you'd have to say 4:3 to say 4 in the time of 3. like this. this is exhausting. need a new pen"

I've been doing research on cognitive functions, I've been looking through different MBTI-related subreddits, I've taken millions of different personality tests and it's driving me insane because I get different results every darn time!! I really have this need/desire to fit in one of the 16 personality types, but I just can't seem to truly relate to any of them (for example, I'm too dumb to be an INTP, not sporty/active enough to be an ISTP, way too lazy to be an ISTJ etc.)... Maybe I'm not meant to have a personality after all? Maybe there's a secret 17th personality type that I do not know of? Do these 16 personality types even matter? I have zero idea at this point. Do you have any advice on getting over this 16-personalities-thing? This is just getting out of hand, but I don't know how to stop myself from obsessing over it.

        "question": "as I try to type this up it seems stupider because I can't quite figure out how to word it properly to make the distinction I'm worried about clear. But do you think chords have functions, or is it just notes that are functional? And chords that have a lot of notes with a certain function end up functioning like that because on average the set of notes ends up functioning like the function that is most common amongst the notes? Like, is V7 dominant because V7 is dominant? Or is V7 dominant because 7, 2, and 4 are dominant-function-sounding notes in the scale and they make up the majority of the V7 chord?",
        "answer": "it's the whole sound combined, including any cognitive visual and/or linguistic information, which will overall have the true function it's more relative than that. it's more about the relationships to each other to be honest i have no idea why the word dominant is used to describe that particular chord. if anything really describes it most, i'd call it 'twangy', and it particularly describes the relationship of (for example) b and f notes (in G7), and more specifically, if you put G bass under that, it's called G7. the b+f creates the twang (due to their harsh relationship), and the bass on G makes it sound like a G major chord. with the twang"

Are they hardly more complex than those of animals, possibly an ancient evolutionary feature? With this in mind - do you believe there are limits to musical originality/creativity and meticulous crafting in what appears to still have merit in a human audience?

How far do you think fallacy regulation would take us and towards good or bad? I've gotten targeted \"coding your games is easier than you think\" i'm like the fuck you know what i think, you don't know me. targeted ads after certain ads are shown would be a fun/perhaps informative campaign and critical thinking /fallacy informing. \"Hi, if you're seeing this you just got x ad before this one, so be aware that that checkbox they're making you want to tick, by getting their product might not be a checkbox worth ticking, or not even a checkbox. theres not even paper or a document open\".

        "question": "I've had a YouTube channel since 2007 that I infrequently upload videos to and ever since 2011 I've been saying \"okay - I'm going to get my shit together and make all these videos I have ideas for and get on a consistent release schedule.\" Every time I get my shit together, there's some major problem - like with an instrument, camera, software, or some other piece of gear. Lately, I've had the time and money to get shit together and ACTUALLY DO IT but I tell myself \"oh, I can't speak in front of a camera until I can get over this bad episode of acne\" or \"I need to have this or that to make for an interesting shot\". I've realized that my problems are partially in my head and I've been making excuses, procrastinating, etc... I know this is partially due to my anxiety problems - and I've heard friends (mostly actors) describe it as \"being in your head\". I say all that to tell you tha t your videos and audio recordings buried on your website that show a glimpse into your creative process - especially when you were starting with Vine - have really helped me and inspired me. A lot of that stuff made me feel like I wasn't alone and crazy whenever I talk to myself about grand ideas in order to sort things out or I try to hype myself up to get some creative endeavor done. Is there any advice you can impart that'll encourage me to do \"the damn thing\"? Or could you explain how you came to figure out your \"process\" and how to quit procrastinating and making excuses?",
        "answer": "ah, you must complete the 12 levels of suffering, then the 13th which is the unlucky last and final level; the reason it is unlucky is because after you finish it you will be informed that there is another level after that"

        "question": "Hey Bill. A couple weeks ago, I started making music. It's nothing crazy or anything, but it's just that lately I haven't been enjoying video games quite as much so it's something else to do. I kind of have two questions, though. Firstly, I was wondering how you start writing a song. For me, I've just hit a few piano notes at random until I heard a little melody that I liked just by coincidence and that's where I start, but it sort of feels like I'm cheating because I imagine real musicians put a lot more thought into their music. My other question is: do you think it's okay for songs to be short. I've never made anything longer than a minute. Maybe this was a weird question, I dunno. Thanks though.",
        "answer": "any way. this can be confusing until you are able to convince yourself that you statistically might do it everyway that's the way normal, sensible people do it, and i only discovered that trick very recently. it works fantastically well, i don't know why i was ever so afraid of it music is everywhere. think as little or as much as you want. think a medium amount. go back and forth between the amounts and levels at which you think. there is music to be woven in and among any and all or none of those states if you want them to get on spotify, you're going to have to go through a lot of work to get them to accept it if it's under a minute. so i suppose at that point, the next question you would have to ask yourself is is it ok to not be on spotify"

        "answer": "i think i can safely say, the essence of that chord for the most part in today's society is, for example, C in the bass and E and Bb near the middle C range. that would be the commonly understood and socially functional and effective essence of the C7 chord, in so far as i have experienced"

        "question": "hey bill what key is the song Help! by the beatles in? Sounds like Amaj but it has a G chord in it and that isn't in Amaj. If it is A major, where does that G come from?",
        "answer": "i would say the intro is Bmin, setting up to seem like it's going to be in D, (hanging on the final A7 sounds like we're about to go to verse in D) but surprise, it's just not. verse is in A. this coasts along comfortably and normally in A, for a while. Then, when it goes \"help me if you can i'm feeling down\" this is essentually 2 parallel universes running side by side. according to what came before, this sounds like the 2 min chord. so the G will now sound like an interesting flat7. but by the time we hit the E7, all of a sudden you can re-map the entire last 4 bars (two chords worth) as if they have been in Bmin (D) the whole time. similarly showing up at that A7 hang about to put you to bed in D, which again it does not, it just stays in A. just does. to have the fun of going around and doing it all again"

        "question": "Hi Bill, With regards to your desire to use AppleScript to press buttons that Automator cannot write scripts for, have you attempted to use macOS's GUI Scripting festures? See the Apple Developer guide here: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/AutomatetheUserInterface.html Hope this helps. Take care, give care, kill all cops, -Maymay",
        "answer": "the ones i'm having trouble with not menus. but the way i can list everything (more than menus) is by saying \"UI elements.\" an example of ones that are giving me trouble are \"static text.\" also, for this, the inspector shown on the page you linked is useful but not really because it usually gives the wrong name of stuff, where as the \"UI elements\" gives the exact name of stuff. but it unfortunately doesn't give all the actions that can be done with it. what's further ironic is that the Automator will record your action beautifully and say \"click static text\". but if you write that yourself exactly in the apple script the same way, it just says 'missing value.' this method works for most buttons/menus, etc, but for certain things, like when you 'click static text' that doesn't work"

        "question": "when you combine a certain thing with another certain thing you can get an incredibly emotional moment. i take for example you songs: in i wanna be a movie star at the part \"everybody wants more than just a friend\" you added the phrase \"let's reestructure the fabric of the known universe\" in the video. the fact here is that you added it at a part when the melody has like a \"rise\" so it causes some kind of euphoria, mixed with adrenaline, inspiration and energy. i mean, if that sentence wouldn't be there it'd definitely have a less-powerful effect. i also noticed that in and the day goes on with the \"mountain escape plan\" and the \"use a bike to escape the grid\" at a calm part preparing for the \"rising part\" (\"and i'm right where I belong\"). but the truth is you do this a lot, countless times, do you do this on purpose? are you conscious of that effect you produce? and how do you know where, when, whenst and how to use it?",

Preamble: you generate a ton of files: text files for ideas, journals, lyrics, scripts, etc etc, images, pictures, screenshots, audio recordings, video recordings, combinations of all of the above when you start editing and putting them together, and all the other things I'm probably missing. Actual question: how do you organize all that? Final rant: I feel that so many of my ideas and projects get stuck just because my laptop is a mess, I have files all over the place, and an organizing system that has a lot of room for improvement and I use only inconsistently. I don't know exactly how or where to start improving this. I'm also afraid that organizing could be a very long project in of itself. HELP! Thanks a lot!",
        "answer": "by date or contents. the computer organizes that for me. yours probably does too i try to put a keyword in the name of the thing, and then add a distinctive keymash (ajoi3rre0) to make sure it doesn't collide. if it's text and need to find it, i can also search by contents. just type distinctive string you know is in there, in quotes. there's a lot of different things depending on your use case. and you also need to organize your mind / life, which is probably the more important challenge"

        "question": "Hi Bill. I just tried to transcribe a song, but there were some ambiguous chords in there. I also don't know if I am notating things correctly. Can you please check? Song (0:00-1:35) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKdHdv6NGf4 Chords (4 bar lines) (Intro) 1sus 1 1maj9 1 (Main) 1 3sus 3 6min 5min7 1aug (~ii V I in key of 4) 47 1/3 2min 4/5 b5\u00b0 47 5/4 3min7 6min7 2min7 27 5sus 5 (Solo section 8 bar lines) 47 3min7 47 6min9 5add6 (Scales: 4Lyd 3Phr 4Lyd 6min 3Phr) 47 3min7 6min7 b7maj7 5sus 5 (4Lyd 3Phr 6min b7Lyd 5mix)",
        "answer": "that generally looks pretty good to me, but the first thing that is definitely wrong is the \"47\"s, those should be 4maj7. besides that, to just nitpick the notation and not the actual content, when you say \"5add6\" i'd say it should be 56. (actually when doing it all in numbers like this i prefer to write the 6 higher than the 5, but that's not always so easy in text, especially plaintext like this, so i don't blame you). another thing, when you have the 1aug, i think it's most likely 1aug7. they're not doing us a favor with the release/cutoff of these chords being so long, the chords are bleeding into each other. Makes that flat5 thing much less effective than it could be, and difficult to identify because if we try to pause and isolate that moment by brute force, it's going to have the previous chord smeared in with it. But for sure plain as day to me that feels like a thing i always use, which would be a 3aug triad over b5 bass note. (not b5dim as you called it) so in this key, Baug/C#. if you listen carefully you can very clearly hear the E note (from the C/D chord) change to Eb during the chord. also, for more even smaller nitpicks, the 2min on the second line is 2min7. just noticed the first chord at the very top also has a 2 in it. so you might say 1sus2,4. and the 1maj9 on the first line i would definitely call that 5/1 (5 over 1). straight off the yacht"

        "question": "RE: Not understanding why anyone would create software and not make every feature accessible via keyboard. Being able to click on stuff means you don't have to memorise a list of commands or even remember that Alt brings up menus. So developers implement being able to click File > Save first and CTRL-S later. Later never comes because the devs ran out of time or were bad at their jobs. I'm an amateur web dev and I'd never heard of this preference. The applause that followed your remark surprised me. Surely your niche opinion on software was not already widely held by that audience; as you had said yourself in what I believe were your initial writings on the matter, you felt that you had held this question subconsciously for a long time before you could express it. But the applause also made sense on a different level. I feel like we all hate the mouse deep in our hearts. Anyway so I looked it up and found out about the principle of keyboard comp atibilit y, which is similarly that all software should be accessible via keyboard because many people aren't able to use a mouse due to a disability. Not sure whether you knew that, but either way, it's a good opinion to be promoting and I'm glad I'm now a slightly less ignorant amateur web dev.",
        "answer": "i never, ever said i was opposed to being able to click on stuff. i don't hate the mouse at all. it's one of the most important inventions of all time when it comes to using a mouse to click on a button, it is extremely inefficient to maneuver the mouse to the location of a fake button and pretend to press it. however, that's a great thing to do when first learning the application. but as you approach an expert level, it becomes vitally important to add the extra speed of using the keyboard. this is only for button-style functions ('do a thing', etc). this does not apply to actual graphical functions that require motion/movement"

        "question": "hey quick question, if i have a chord with a number, say f11, do i just add the fourth note in the scale to the major triad? if so what is the difference between an 11 and a 4? thanks",
        "answer": "that's a weird example which has problems it's less about rules than you may think. it's like spelling. it's developed over time and there are some exceptions that don't make too much logical sense but that's how it's evolved. i will go through all the numbers and see if i can explain what each one probably means. F1 probably a race car F2 you might occasionally see this as an abbreviation for Fsus2, that would be notes F G C F3 nothing that i know of F4 you might occasionally see this as an abbreviation for Fsus4, that would be notes F Bb C F5 that would be a \"power chord\", notes F and C only F6 that would be notes F A C and D, optional to leave C out F7 that means \"F dominant 7\" which is notes F A C and Eb. optional to leave out C F8 i've never seen this used by anyone else, but i personally use it as a chord symbol for F and F (an octave apart) F9 that means \"F dominant 9\" which is notes F A C Eb and G. optional to leave out C. who knows, maybe even leave out A F13 that means \"F dominant 13\" which is notes F A C Eb and D, with likely also G included, and optionally leave out C. maybe even leave out A F10, F12, F14 i've never seen any of those used as chord symbols. F11 the reason i consider this a strange example is because i think given the pattern seen with F9 and F13, it seems that any number higher than 7 will mean Fdominant7 plus that extra note. so according to this pattern, F11 would have to include A, Eb, AND Bb. but it is commonly thought (and taught) that Bb is no good on F7 unless you get rid of the A. in which case it would be called F7sus4. However, one time i saw F11 in a book and they actually used it to represent Eb/F (which means Eb, G, Bb, with F in the bass.) in other words, F9sus4. I'm pretty sure if you write F11, it will be not clear whether it includes the A or not. I'm not sure if F11 is assumed to be shorthand for F7sus4. I don't think it's clear enough. If you actually want the A and the Bb, and the Eb, i would recommend saying F7add4. if you don't want the A, i would recommend saying F7sus4. F11 will be ambiguous on the question of whether to include the A, which is kind of an important question"

        "question": "7.23.19 9:15 pm Hey thanks for the response bill, I figured that was the best and tried laying down a temp track, it just felt a little stale compared to the excitement of getting ideas for first time in a while and how good they sounded to me. is this just me being impatient to record and i should wait, or would experimenting with recording the guitar, adjusting it to tempo and then recording a final track of real time guitar?",
        "answer": "these are 2 extremely different activities. it makes sense that you would feel lost trying to do a solo singer/songwriter 1 instrument+voc song as a full arrangement, and similarly it makes sense that it might feel impossible to take a full arrangement and perform it live with 1 inst+voc. they are completely different machines. the translation can be made, but it might take a lot of experience to figure out how the heck it's gonna work. actually what i was explaining before is that they are such different things that i wouldn't recommend trying to get one to work like the other. you might just feel confused and frustrated. in other words, i would say don't try to play the same kind of guitar track. probably don't even use the guitar, or if you use guitar don't use the same one and don't play it in the same way, and definitely don't do that first. i was recommending doing the percussion first. that's just something i've learned from experience. not the drums, not the bass, not the chords, but actually the percussion. like shakers/tambs/hi hats, etc. ch-k-ch-k-ch that sort of thing. this is why you'll need to have your writing all zipped up at this point, tempo and roadmap need to be finalized in order for this approach to really work. if you're curious as to how to learn how to run such a complex operation, i would suggest starting with songs less than 5 seconds in length"

        "answer": "it just sounds a little different. you'll have to try it and see. actually i can give you a really common example of where B/F# really is what you want. actually let's switch it to the key of C for easier explaining, and it's not actually Cmaj7/G, this example is C/G, but nonetheless i think you will be able to see the difference. Take the song 'happy birthday to you' in the key of C. right before the end of the song, on the last \"birth\". the harmony is probably playing C chord, but i think you'll find that the best place for the bass, at this point in the song, is G. i can name a trillion other examples of popular/classic/traditional songs, over the course of the last 300 years, that have had a 1(chord) over 5(bass) absolutely thrive in this right before the end finalistic 'the song's about to end' spot. you've heard it a million times. try putting C over C there instead .... it doesn't quite fit. it sounds like the beginning of the song, .... right before the end ? ... By the way, to complete the example just you you can hear it clearly, the 'good' way to do it, from the final line \"birth\" is C/G, \"day\" is D7, \"to\" is G7sus4, and \"you\" is C, preferably with the G note left out, just e c , with low C in the bass. and Fmin/Ab was on \"hap\""

        "question": "Ive been on a nostalgia trip listening to music I was making 2-4 years ago when I was trying really hard to release my own stuff and then froze and didn't release/finish anything. The thing is, I hear them now with some distance from those crippling perfectionism days where I perhaps didn't have the skillset to close the gap of my taste vs my skill, and I actually enjoy the attempts, but looking back on the process I wish I could do the same things without my mind getting in the way so I can become even better and not have it be such a passionate swirl of good and bad emotions. Ive been trying to figure out what short form of what I was trying to do back then would sound like because I thought I wanted to try something new on my revisiting of music, but hearing those old tracks make me want to try harder this time, and starting small. Im just thankful that I still have those tracks around to experience my journey even though back then I didn't feel like the y were good enough for me to share because of the expectations I thought people had of me being the guy returning home after going to a great music school. Any experience with similar feelings and how you overcame them?",

AUTOMATOR WATCH-ME-DO SOMETIMES GIVES ME THIS CORRECTLY FOR SIMPLE DIALOGS, BUT FOR OTHER GUI ELEMENTS IT FAILS, SPECIFICALLY FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I CLICK CERTAIN GUI ELEMENTS THE AUTOMATOR WATCH ME DO WILL CLAIM THAT THE APPLE SCRIPT FOR THAT WAS \"CLICK STATIC TEXT\" OF ETC ETC WHICH IF I TURN AROUND AND RUN THAT IN APPLESCRIPT IT WILL SIMPLY SAY \"MISSING VALUE.\" THE QUESTION IS HOW DO I FIND OUT WHAT THE CORRECT SCRIPT CODES ARE FOR MY FAVORITE GUI ACTIONS thanks for your consideration, prize offered"

Feel free to use me as a rubber duck",
        "answer": "in many cases when there's no keyboard shortcut and no menu item, it often is accessible by applescript. but there is a specific kind of situation where clicking something in real life makes something happen, and the automator recorder claims that what i did can be translated to applescript as \"click static text\", and yet putting that into applescript yields \"missing value.\" in approximately half of these situations, the parent item is \"row\", and if that's the case, i have found a secret solution of saying \"select row.\" yes actually in all these cases there is a number after it, \"static text 1\" or \"static text 2\". getting rid of the others would be impossible because it's usually clicking something in a list, or clicking amongst a set of 'buttons', but it would be the only one with that number (i assume)"

        "question": "With regards to the \"Click static text\" issue, it might be that the text itself doesn't have a clickable action associated with it. Button components have 2 visible elements to it, the outer bounding box, and the text inside it. In typical usage, a mouse click within the bounding box triggers the action of the button. The click action can be associated with the inclosed text, the bounding box, or both. If the text has no clickable action, it seems reasonable that \"missing value\" would be returned, even if it is able to find the text itself. Automator may have incorrectly assumed the click action was associated with the text instead of the bounding box, or if your program is particularly nasty, the click action may be just associated with a certain x y position on the screen. Somehow you have to get the name of the actual button box, and script a click action on that box rather than the text. If it is possible to script a click action to a x y positio n, you c an hopefully skip this mess, although as you mentioned previously you would need to watch window size/position or create different scripts for different work environments. It might be possible to script window positioning as well. Note: I probably should mention I have computer experience but not with Mac, so this is all \"informed\" guessing.",
        "answer": "i've looked everywhere in \"accessibility inspector\", suspecting that it may be hidden neatly behind something. but i don't think you can move anything out of the way in accessibility inspector. but, i've found some pretty thorough scripts that extrapolate every possible UI element (or so they say ....) and gone through every single one of them and not found the secret button i'm looking for. so i don't know yes, i can do that yes, i do that all the time. and that does work here. but for various reasons i am definitely looking for something snappier in this case. i just really think there is a snappier way. actually i think there's some even better ways with jxa or swift or something to get way more internal and skip the UI, but i can't find ANY inspectors or recorders, or any way to actually learn what i'm going for"

        "question": "Allo! I was wondering: I discovered your reality videos last summer, and I kind of understood, reading some of the questions page, that they were old recording that you edit many years after, and post online maybe even later. I thought I read somewhere that you posted a new one every friday, but I'm not sure I understood right, since I come regularly to see if there are any updates, and I haven't seen new entries lately. What's the process for the reality videos? I find them super super super interesting. I'm in the middle of a very very huge projet that I know it will work and I'm extremely excited about how it will turn out, but at the same time absolutely terrified at the colossal amount of work it represents. So I relate to those video you made, while you were working on HOTEWIG. (thanks) - good luck for your current projet! It's gonna be hard, but it's gonna be worth it",

        "question": "Serious question: your music has a masterful way of building tension and then resolving it; using both clever chord progressions and cadences as well as melodic fills-- then it swings effortlessly back into a catchy hook or chorus. This honestly feels similar to how baroque music works. What is your thought process when you compose these things? Is it instinct, or is all of this meticulously planned using advanced music theory? Anyway, sorry for the long question, big fan and fellow musician here trying to analyze your style.",
        "answer": "what works best for me is a door touch, kind of a superstition, re-setting my mind from a new listener's point of view, then play the existing song as far as it goes, with metranome, from beginning. then, at the moment when i reach the 'end' (or as far as it goes so far), that's the moment i listen very very carefully. only in that moment, after a clean run through, will i hear the solution. after a window of about 3 to 5 seconds, it gets much much less likely to get a reliable answer. at that point, i can do one of 2 things. i can go ahead and do another door touch and start again, or, if i've done too many run-throughs in a row and burned out the effectiveness of the run-through, i will try to play process of elimination. play detective with it a little. try to at least categorize all imaginable solutions. kind of like on 20 questions where they start by asking 'is it bigger than a breadbox'"

        "question": "Hi, Bill. i read that you said: \"my secret is just live under a rock\" regarding your style of content. in some media it's really hard to come up with anything original if you haven't at least got an overview of the surroundings, just so you don't unknowingly repeat someone else's idea. on the other hand, you've been creating for so long now, your stuff's been maturing in a unique barrel, so it's got to be original in some way or other. do you think being idiosyncratic and persistent enough is a good way to create original content? also, is it really less reliable than \"knowing the literature\"? people will say \"lone wolf runaway hits are very rare\" but still, how likely are you to create something interesting by deducing your way to an idea after analyzing what everyone else has done? maybe there's a balance to strike here. i'd like to hear your thoughts. thanks",
        "answer": "yes i think the quote you said is actually referencing content for Vine. i did not spend any time watching any popular vine channels. but what i have done is listen to 1000s and 1000s and 1000s of songs from the past 100 years. and i've seen a lot of video content. it's good to be very experienced, but then add a twist. always good to bring experience from one area to a completely different area. good things might happen"

        "question": "a very long time ago, i said something along the lines of, \"i'm beginning to think that minor thirds are a very important interval. as in, maybe The Most important.\" and responded something like, \"i see what you mean but you may discover that major seconds are more important.\" and my idea was--look at the minor thirds in a chord to see where it wants to resolve and how badly. Fm6 wants to resolve to C, G7 and G7b9 want to resolve to C, or to Cm, or if you get sneaky they might go to Am or A, or even F# in some cases. and you look at the common notes here: D, F, Ab, B like to go to chords with their root on C, Eb, F#, A. and a lot of things can be explained by this pattern of minor third series. so i thought about your answer and how maybe it could fill some holes in my theory, like how Gsus4 likes to go to G, or how Eaug7 likes to go to E7 before it goes to Am, but ultimately i do not understand why what you said would be true. i know it was a long t ime ago but if you could explain why you might have said that i would appreciate the closure",
        "answer": "true in your first question you didn't give any specifics, you just said ' i think major 3rds might be like the most important thing in the world' . And i believed you, but also true is things like wheels, tables, apples, and so on, could also be similarly thought of as 'the greatest thing in the world'. and probably to have a nice good world you'd probably need a little bit of them all. What you just gave above is wonderful. this has nothing to do with what i had in mind about major seconds being so useful. Melodies come to mind, when thinking about how 'important' major seconds are. And actually, when you first said 'wow major thirds are like really important', my mind immediately went to melodies (you didn't specify what you really meant, like you didn't specify that you were talking about harmonic resolutions, etc) so yeah, i sort of had to guess what you were talking about, and my mind went to melodies. in which case i think it's easy to see why min 3rds and maj 2nds together are hugely important for that game. maj2nds being an absolutely essential building block of anyone's melody kit"

        "question": "what's your opinion on wireless ear buds",
        "answer": "latency hasn't come down enough for it to be good enough for things requiring instant response to user actions. i.e. music production, or phone conversations, or any type of game where it's important to hear an instant sound response to something you did. they're awesome as long as you're just consuming audio tracks (listening to music, not interacting with it) because once the song starts (half second late) it doesn't matter if the whole song is a half second late. Even video watching is ok, because most video players are smart enough to buffer it right so the vid syncs right with the audio. But if you're recording music, you're still looking at at least a 200ms latency. can't play an instrument that way. And this is not good for intimate phone calls either, because as it is, in the digital world, all cell phone calls have about half second delay (or more) already. And this gets worse when you're doing international, or internet calling. wireless ear phones will add at least quarter second delay on top of that. however, besides all that, it is truly awesome to have no wires. but i'd say the latency probably isn't down enough to discontinue the headphone jack just yet"

Whats a good way to get over the feeling of having to explain up until the point one is convinced the other has heard to instead be able to get over it and move on. It can even be when giving advice, that maybe the other person doesn't want to hear or is not receiving well, i find that the need to give the advice can be more harmful than the advice itself since it can make the other person feel like they have a bigger problem than they do, or feel like they have emotional homework now having had pointed stuff out. How to know when one wants the advice vs not wanting it. How to stop going in circles when gi ving adv ice and not being cued of the fact that they get it, i dont even know what im trying to ask anymore.

        "answer": "it's just gonna depend on the sound of the instrument you're using. i don't know any greater context of the song you're in, and this may give you a warmer sound for that last chord which may or may not be what you're looking for, but might i suggest swapping the higher F out for A. but that might totally go against what you're looking for, and i think it's more likely that you just wanna finesse the instruments a bit more. try a diff instrument, try combining 2 instruments, seeing which notes you can play louder or softer on each instrument and blend it differently. maybe actually just take out that higher F. and if you want more density you could go for the A, which again will be more of a warm and cuddly sound which may or may not be what you want"

        "question": "Hello Bill. which method do you think is the best way to organize your music? I have lots of music on my archive that i've collected over the course of 20 years and that i deeply care about (i hate all sorts of streaming sites). And i've put a lot of effort into shaping my music directory and now i am looking at it thinking if i can use more simplified method. My music directory goes like this: I have a main music directory named 'Music'. And then, this directory divides into the music genres, and then into subgenres, then into artists, then into albums (if there's any). Then you find mp3/flac files in those directories. If a song of said artist doesn't belong to any album (ie. single song, etc) it goes into directory named 'singles' in the artist's directory. Also, any songs whose artists i have only one song of, they go to the another directory named 'Singles' in the proper genre/subgenre. For example, if i wanna listen t o Michae l Jackson's Billie Jean, the path i have to go thru is Music -> Pop -> Michael Jackson - > Thriller, because i have the entire album. Or, 'Zhi-Vago - Celebrate the Love (Club Mix)' is in Music -> Electronic Music -> Trance -> Dream Trance -> Singles, because it's the only song i have of Zhi-Vago. When you look at it, it really is good method. All songs from all artists in the same genre is in one place. It makes it easier to listen in Winamp. UNLESS artist have many songs from many different music genres. That's the frustrating part. Do you think this method is good? How did you do yours? And your thoughts in general? Thanks.",
        "answer": "no all songs together in list, organized by date added. played in random order, but searchable by name. would be useful to have it sorted accurately by date released, but let's face it, in a world of potentially infinite songs, the info on that is never gonna be complete unless you spend the rest of your life managing that i try to keep things organized as organically as possible in terms of the song's natural relationship with me. nature is the most powerful organizer"

        "question": "Bill, what's up? Can I tell you something? I'm having severe issues with the VAST amounts of misinformation being spread mainly by vox populi and youtube/internet articles regarding music education. It's driving me nuts. One of the worst (and I tend to disagree on a lot of things), I think, it's about the myth regarding strength and exercise needed to play an instrument, as if playing guitar, piano or even drums required some sort of strong physical competence to the extent professional athletes do. I truly believe that playing and instruments in general (save some occasions and styles like flamenco or extreme metal, perhaps) are learned through very simple principles applied through musical concepts (or just music), with just standard physical well being (in the majority of cases already achieved) regardless of gender, ethnicity and to some extent age (and there tons of exceptions to my favor to th is too!! But let's play). I'm seeing people getting hurt trying to get better at their instruments the wrong way and it breaks my heart. I'm a professional musician and educator and I would really like to have your take on this. I think you are a true great musician and am a big fan of your work, by the way! Cheers! P.S.: Just in case, nothing against sports, exercise, fitness or whatever.",
        "answer": "if you think they are really doing it wrong, you could try to show them what you think is a better way, but if they are not in the mood to hear it then don't worry too much about it. if they hurt themselves a bit later, hopefully they will be more interested in solutions then. but also be careful not to get wrapped up in wishing everyone played like you. it's easy to feel that way. quite often when i see drummers playing matched grip, i tense up and feel uncomfortable watching them. but in reality, it's 2020 and i think 98% of players are matched now. Or to be more specific, i see a surprising amount of players seemingly not doing anything 'moeler'ish whatsoever in their right hi-hat hand. meaning they're not packaging the strokes in groups of 2, in one single motion together. instead they're just hammering away with their entire arm, for every stroke, going through a lot more effort, looking kind of like they're trying to shake a baby or something. But still, it's on you to sell them on whatever better way you have. kind of like, 'hey, looks pretty tiring the way you're trying to pound out every stroke individually, .... well check this out' and then show them. If you sell it well, they will buy it. But it also comes down to whether it's really right for them or not. If it is, they will know, the first time they see it. and if they don't, then it could be time to start seeing other people. i don't really know, i quit teaching after 2 days"

But, here i was, suddenly doing most of my work in a different program which has the distinct advantage of being available on computers made later than 2014. so being aware of that, a spectacular cascade of events suddenly began to unfold, which i can possibly trace back to viewing a youtube rental of spiderman into the spider verse, for which the only way i could watch it was on a borrowed computer, because my main computer had finally become officially too old to play the movie with ANY browser. that realization, combined with seeing how much faster this borrowed computer was from mine (despite actually being the same age), combined with the outrageousness of the visual effects in that particular movie, combined with the previously mentioned reasons for being ready to make the transition, i decided to reach deep into the savings acount and see if i can make things a little more interesting ............"

        "question": "8.17.19 10:24 pm i have access to a bunch of mac laptops from various (2009-2019) years tomorrow, i will attempt to do some experimenting then. your first issue seems to be a glitch, but as to the second: have you tried following the directions on this page? https://support.apple.com/guide/console/find-log-messages-and-activities-cnslbf30b61a/1.1/mac/10.14 from what i understand, you first create a filter by right clicking to show or hide a process; the filter moves to the search menu. then, you click the arrow that appears next to the filter, which opens up a host of options to do things like \"hide anything that contains xyz\" or \"hide any process of specific types\". the pictures given by this page seem to indicate that this can be inclusive or exclusive, depending on whether the filter is blue or red. i don't know if you have the right kind of mac to use this fu nctional ity though",

        "answer": "that's what it's supposed to do. on mine it stops almost, but new stuff still comes in. much less, but just enough to disrupt the reading experience every 2 seconds or so thanks for the right click folks, that is tremendous"

That would be a several metric shit-tons of drones. And I wonder how you'd prevent all the cars from just trying to fly over top of traffic jams and endanger each other? Now you've got a third dimension of regulation to worry about that you didn't have before, far dwarfing the implementation details of today's air traffic control systems since there are so many more cars. It's such a common futuristic idea but it seems really difficult to realistically manage, even if we had the tech for it. What do you think?",
        "answer": "could have like digital lanes. the cars are not capable of going outside the lanes. Or, they could possibly allow you to go a little bit out of lane, enough that it is still safe, but they can still fine people for it. could be a good revenue stream, to help pay for all the digital lanes"

        "question": "Do you regret switching to the shittier version of Final Cut? I don't know about you but it's my biggest regret. So much so that i abandoned it and did something i never thought i would. I switched to Windows and started using Premiere some time ago. I didn't like FCP X but i wish you good luck with it. I hope you get things sorted out and make awesome content again.",
        "answer": "it's not clear which one is shittier, but either way that's not quite what happened one thing that may surprise you, is that premier, the old final cut, and the new final cut, were all invented/designed by the same person it was incomplete when they first released it. it's probably much different than when you saw it. but another distracting /confusing issue back then was that it was named the same thing as something different"

        "question": "i heard you have perfect pitch, but i also heard you started musical training at age 10 and that you are completely self trained. were you just born with it ? and has it ever helped your music making ?",
        "answer": "not to be confused with perfectly good relative pitch, which i do have, absolute pitch is something i do not absolutely have, but over the years i have developed an extremely good way to fake it to a 95% level of reliability 2 absolute pitch is not so important, and i was not even raised to believe it was particularly possible. then later in life i became disappointed that i didn't prioritize that at an earlier age. i have been able to hijack my strong permanent absolute memory of C to essentially appear to have absolute pitch, at least as good as anyone i've ever met who claims to have it. so that will have to be good enough it can be useful if i am listening to a song that does some super slick modulations, for example if i am doubting if we're now in A or D, that would be easy to mess up except with my new tricks i'll always be on board"

        "answer": "it's RGB. the first 2 digits are red, the middle 2 is green, the last 2 is blue. it's hexidecimal, but let's pretend for a moment it's regular. higher number is brighter. so 00 00 00 would be no red, no green, no blue. so that means totally black. 99 00 00 means a lot of red, no green, no blue. so that's red. 99 00 55 means red with a little bit of blue. so maybe magenta. But all this is slightly false because the numbers are actually supposed to be hexidecimal. which means instead of 0123456789, it's 0123456789abcdef. so 00 is the least and ff is the most. so 00FF00 is full green, 0000FF is full blue, 0000EE is almost full blue, and FFFFFF is full white. 888888 is grey. 995555 would be grey with a slightly reddish tint. 'A' comes after 9, so AA5555 would be the same but slightly more red. etc"

I dont know if highhat+snare comes easily because of so many years of finger drumming and playing around with patterns. But now that im trying to actually learn to play drums i find it i can be creative in the arm area but cant really incorporate kick aside from perhaps a 4 on the floor or similar things. as soon as i try to perhaps keep a constant 16ths in highhat and throw some snares in there, i cant really keep up with kick stuff, i feel like perhaps my weight isnt well distributed and whenever i hit the kick i have to rebalance myself some way, any tips for that? And avoiding backpain when playing drums",

I'll use rappers as an example. If you listen to the studio version of the song it sounds great, but when it comes to rapping the live, they'd just scream out the lyrics at least an octave higher. I think they sometimes sacrifice some of the music just to get the audience pumped up. What's your take on this?",

        "answer": "could be C6 or Amin7, but i wouldn't say \"over C\" unless the C was truly low enough to feel like a bass note, and if it is, then the other notes should be at least an octave above or else i would call it mush with no bass note it's not entirely clear, but by default i think Cmin6 is the most obvious way to put it the note under the slash is supposed to be a bass note. if it's right in there in the same range as the chord, then it's not really gonna feel like a bass note"

        "question": "Hi Bill, I recently tried transcribing a piece, but the guitars were pretty soft and I'm not sure if I caught all the notes. Would you mind looking it over? https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=qySn2yDBKUg (plays twice) 4 bar lines (Intro) 5/1 4/1 5/1 4/1 (rule the world) (Main) 5/1 4/1 5/1 4/1 5/1 4/1 5/1 4/1 6min 4 1 1sus 1 1sus 6min 4 5sus i1 17 4maj7 4min(maj7) 3min7 6min 2min9 4/5 1 17 4maj7 4min(maj7) 3min7 6min 2min9 4/5",
        "answer": "those seem to be 4/1 not 1sus4 but close enough i think i'd prefer to say 57sus here definitely prefer to say b7 over 1 6min7 but close enough would prefer to say 57sus4, and if you're saying actual triads, then you might as well notate it because there's a couple different triads there, but good enough also i would say 2min7, not seeing it necessary to say 2min9, i'm actually not hearing that also, i might want to say, for those 4min(maj)7, it is extremely tempting for me to just call that 4min6, because that's what the melody is doing. whether or not the guitar is actually playing it as 4min(maj7) underneath there is open for debate, i defintely don't hear it the second time, i might hear it the first time. if i were charting this for a band i would definitely just say 4min6 just to make sure everyone's on board, the important thing is to stop them from playing min7 on there and min6 will certainly be exactly what's needed"

I had forgotten about them. So I have them in the bag still, saving them for a private function I'll be performing at with a friend in a couple weeks.

        "question": "have you written any other music since you started working on the video or have the past 5 months been solely devoted to this project",
        "answer": "i wrote song, recorded it, finished it to the final mix. done. then started a video for it, but for some reason, there was a little voice in my head that told me to instead of using the 3D program for just little bits of the video, how about using it for the entire thing. well, for those of you who don't know, 3D video usually takes 100,000 years longer than anyone would ever imagine. but another interesting thing about 3D, is that it seems like the whole universe has just opened up. in ways that i have only dreamed about. vast new world. resonating strongly with filmmaking desires i've probably had since childhood but never admitted it, because 3D graphics has never really been anything that 1 person alone could really delve into, perhaps until this generation. so i'd say it was about 2 solid months down the rabbit hole of working on that music video, which really was turning out to the most exciting thing i had ever worked on. then it began to occur to me that now is a better time than ever to upgrade to a much newer system, because the reason i had waited was because my previous full time video software was long ago discontinued, and literally only worked on old computers. so i've been stuck on an old computer system for many years. given that i found myself now working on different software (the 3D one) which is not discontinued, it began to occur to me that the big shift is imminent. then a series of events unfolded that suddenly plunged me into the shift. and in the process, a thousand more doors and windows have begun to open. the possibilities are wildly beyond my greatest imagination. an interesting twist is, my entire old method no longer works on this new system (at least for video. for music everything's pretty much still intact, with all the benefit of the new system.) the old video system is still available on an ancient computer in the corner, but let's face it, the new possibilities wipe the old system off the map"

Actually, i'm pretty sure that they will all be recognized as different no matter what. i've never actually tried to use 2 that are the identically exact same model so i'm not sure, but i'm pretty sure it would be fine. then, one slight problem you may run into, next time you restart your computer, if the keyboards don't work when you restart, just sleep the computer real quick and wake it up. then they should work. another side warning, if you do get this working, watch out for the binge-buying of keyboards that may occur as a result"

        "answer": "anything's good in the right context. when you say 'classical music', that sounds like only part of the experience. if the real 100% focus is the music, you're still going to need an environment to put the music in. at the very least a fancy room or parlour, set for the time period. if there's absolutely no other context from the music, it will not be clear where you are supposed to be. you will think you are trapped in a waiting room or hallway somewhere. even the original rendition was not in this barren a context, you see"

        "question": "what if you didnt filter out stuff for reality and instead released all? then your content with regards to your self documenting can be as efficient as possible. 1 hour of work (minus logistic time expenses) = 1 hour content. I just recorded my first hour of thoughts (not trying to organize my thoughts but to think outloud entertainingly, entertaining myself pretty much and my thoughts, kinda the free form posts i can sometimes make here), and i keep thinking but can't really think of anyone who would be interested in listening to outloud thinking when its not for entertaining purposes. But I think maybe there might. Like, I turned on the mic and thought out loud it for 52 minutes and thinking of it being able to be as a standalone thing that's releasable. And I keep thinking but i think its maybe just a bit less tiring to do it without that extra minigame. Do you think that minigame should be the norm? that i should strive to be as entert aining/e fficient thoughtwise even when the mics off. Now if that were the case, wouldn't that make my aspiration to have every thought be content? Then how would I organize that, and when? I think maybe theres a benefit of only turning it on in certain times and be able to verbalize what has been inner dialogue only for a while, and that in itself can be an interesting display of words over time. I'd like to invite you to be the first listener of the first outloud thought session. (the whole what the hell is a podcast thing rubbed off on me which is why ive avoided the word throughout this, i realize i have a similar thing with \"philosophizing\", its just thinking really, the proper way perhaps, although thats already adding a bit of my biases). I think not thinking of it as a podcast would limit myself to thinking \"you cant release 3 today!\" If i felt like recording 3 outloud thought sessions in a day. because that doesn't fit my idea of what a podcast is, and that ma y bias the way i do what i do and how i do it or even worse, how i think of it. Turns out i came here to ask about why not release unedited reality footage but i really just wanted to talk about my first time doing something that felt natural since I am still riding that high. Hope you're having a bunch of fun and fulfilment playing around with your process and thanks for doing what you do and how you do it, i wouldnt be able to think doing whatever made sense if i didnt see you make sense of whatever you do. I'd normally go back and add parenthesis to afterthoughts but ive learned its more pure when the words are chronologically put where they are. Maybe not pure but characteristically something else.",

        "answer": "impossible. you'll only see/hear it in context. try watching movies or videos. the movie may cause you to develop more of an attachmental bias to the music, but that's actually the way it's supposed to be. the music you liked before almost certainly came to you packaged in some way contextually. it's no accident that most people's favorite songs is something they heard in a movie, in a game, or while something was happening or while they were somewhere. you always are somewhere, that's just the law"

        "question": "Hey Bill! I'm currently trying to write a song called Birdhead, a long story about a man with a bird in his mind who bounces around his head, making him feel different things for the bird; loathing, euphoria, etc. But I feel as if I've hit a wall with the idea. I quite like it, and i've written a few bars, but the ending is absolutely killing me to write. From one songwriter to another, what's your process for ending songs?",
        "answer": "whether it's time for the ending or not, the process is the same. start with a fresh mind, and play the song in real time from the beginning (at the proper tempo. use a metronome). just as you reach the end of the last known part, this is when the answers will present themselves to you. if you can, try to shut off the metronome within 4 bars of when you reach the end. pay very close attention in that moment, within 5 seconds before and after you reach the end. this is when the lightning will strike. try to gather as much as you can from that moment. then, in the following seconds after that, as the moment fades, start to analyze what you think you heard or thought of, and ask some questions to try to narrow it down. then, the only thing you can do is refresh your mind and do it again. the best way to refresh your mind on this is to not hear the song for several hours. but, not everyone has time to waste several hours between run thrus, so what i usually do is start the metronome, walk to the door and touch the door and then return and start. another productivity tip is to be threatened by villains"

        "question": "Can you talk us through the process of writing and recording Just Did a Bad Thing?",
        "answer": "yes, if i can remember. the first line had been on the shelf since maybe september? [checking] october 19, 2018. it was just the first line. then when it came time to pick a song, in december, i think i narrowed it down to about 20 songs and then my mistake was that i went through those 20 and narrowed it down again, and it got narrowed down to zero. so i went back to the list of 20 and picked the one i thought was the weakest. and it was that one. then i wrote it, very fast, because i was still attempting to do the 2-week schedule at that time, but i think it had already fallen apart by then. but i think i had convinced myself of some backup plan during that time. it was a long string of failures during that time, regarding the schedule. other than that i don't remember too much about the writing process. it was pretty standard. oh here's something i remember about the writing: the 'hey, what's the name of this game, ..etc.' all of that, after i wrote that i thought it was great but not right for this song. so i spent quite a while trying to come up with a plan B for that, and save that for a different song. i was really convinced that wasn't going to work for this song, as much as i liked it. then eventually i gave into using it. after that i think the writing went pretty smoothly and quickly. the recording process went slightly slower than some of the previous songs because i was just tired of rushing. it was probably rushed until i realized i had blown whatever the latest deadline was, then i was probably a bit more meticulous after that. and the release got screwed up too, because i was aiming for a certain date with the video so i sent it to the stores 2 days before that date, but couldn't finish the video. so the song hit the stores way before the video, by mistake. it was awkward. that turned out to be what the bad thing was"

(they are all getting closer together.) then C again (262) then something around D (294?) then another E which rings perfectly in harmony with C (327.5), then, this might be the one you're looking for, something that's like exactly halfway between E and G. so it will be somewhere between F and F#. 360.25. not good. then the next one is another clean G. then some more ugly in between ones. did we get to the one you want yet"

        "answer": "bits and pieces may come to me at any time. need to be adept at catching them, recording them, and logging them into a master list, by date. then there's the selection process, for that i usually go through the whole list and write down ones that i am excited about doing. then, when that semi-finals list is done, immediately put it through a number-randomizer to get the final selection. then, when i have the selection, i have to play doctor with it. i have to look at it and make an assessment as to what the nature of that item is, whether it is the chorus, the first verse, etc etc. ... and evaluate what it needs. things get confusing if it's not the intro, because that means i have to work backwards, which can be very tedious. but if i just hang around and ask the right questions, i can get there. once i have the beginning, then it's a little more standard. just do run throughs from the beginning, in time (at tempo, with click) and then pay very close attention to the moments right when i reach the ending edge of what's written. that's when i may or may not be struck with solutions for what follows. then, whether or not it strikes, evaluate for a minute what the implications may be, then do a re-set, which for me is touch the door, and then run it again"

        "question": "Hello I realised am addicted to quite a few different things. In order of addictiveness they are: Nicotine (vape. every 10 minutes) Caffeine (2-3 in the morning) Weed (every night and all day on the weekends) Alcohol (every night with more on the weekends) Fapping (every night and sometimes more) Takeaway food (5-6 times a week) These are the main ones. No single one is ruining my life (maybe alcohol and weed a little), but the main thing is that I want to be free and natural. Apart from weaning myself off caffeine, I plan to give them all up cold turkey at the same time for 30 days (except for Takeaway food if I am stuck some day). I can't find anything of anyone else doing similar. Do you think it's a bad idea to give up so much so quick? I am thinking of documenting my experience.",
        "answer": "you could try it, but don't necessarily expect it to work. you might find that at least some of them will be easier to quit than you expected. some of them also might be more important to quit than others. but it could be interesting to try to quit all of them, just to see what the hell happens. it might be so much fun that you may want to start again just so you can have the fun of quitting again"

        "answer": "that would be exactly 4:3. the word \"pistol\" starts exactly on beat 4, and there have been exactly 16 notes covering the span of 12 normal subdivisions. if i had to write that for myself to read, i might do something like this. truly the sound is pretty exact dotted 16th notes, which are probably not pleasant for anyone to read. but the way i wrote it at least gives an idea of the neighborhood of where the beats land, while also making a written note to clarify. or maybe i would write a note to myself \"actually dotted 16ths\" because i am aware of how dotted 16ths are supposed to land, mathematically. (4:3 like you said). actually, update, at this tempo it would actually be dotted 32nd notes. same concept but even more beams. even more of a reading nightmare"

The music is saying \"salutations Sir/Madam, i hope this finds you well. i've heard of your recent experiences and wish you well in your endeavors. may you bring light and wonder and joy to whoever you meet and wherever you go. by the way what's a good breakfast to cook? kind regards, Music\" like this perhaps?!?",

        "question": "I'm thinking of buying a midi keyboard. I've always been interested in music, and I've been making songs on my computer for a few years now, but I'm not very good at it and it's always a struggle. However, I have a feeling that getting a keyboard (I've never played an instrument) could dramatically improve my skills and make everything a lot more fun. But I can't help but feel that this is a foolish thing to hope for. If I'm bad at music now, why would that change if I got a shiny, expensive tool? If I was truly good at it, could I not compose masterpieces with nothing but a pen and paper? And so, I find myself in a dead end of doubt. To elaborate, I imagine that playing a keyboard would let me absorb music theory concepts (namely a feel for harmony) intuitively by playing existing songs (which includes learning them), and noodling around, performing rapid experimentation at a rate 10000 times higher than possible by clicking in notes with a mou se. And playing an instrument seems like something that brings you really close to the music. That's a feeling I long for. I got a taste of it by my DAW that lets me play notes with my computer keyboard, and I had a blast with it (but of course I quickly ran into ghosting and range issues). But on the other hand, I've been dabbling with music for years now (I have over 500 unique projects on my laptop) and still don't have much to show for it. That sounds like a red flag signifying that there is no hope to me. I fear that my keyboard would end up a grand waste of money and space, since I lack the talent needed to operate it. So my question is: is it realistic to hope for a dramatic skill improvement as a result of obtaining a keyboard, or am I a victim of capitalism foolishly hoping that buying something will fix my problems? Sorry that this got so long, but I felt like I needed to write it all down. Thanks for reading this if you did!",
        "answer": "keyboards are very friendly. you might be surprised at how friendly they are sure, but if you want it to be music, you're gonna want to get something to play with. music will only be able to survive on the paper if you've already spent seemingly lifetimes with instruments oh man, wow. that's for sure that's true. it's like going to the meat store, always gets you closer to the meat i am pleased to announce that if you get a music keyboard, (as long as you don't get one of the toy ones) it will actually sense how loud/soft you hit the notes. so that will be instantly a whole new layer of feels that you have been completely deprived of, because the computer keyboard is not pressure sensitive that reminds me of a swimmer who has decided how good/bad they are at swimming before actually touching any water it's going to be impossible to learn music without an instrument. even if you only sing, you're probably never gonna feel the power of music until you can play with some chords too. which keyboards tend to enable, quite easily in a friendly manner"

        "question": "can i add a wireless keyboard to keyboard maestro as a macro controller? how do i do this so the keyboard won't actually press that key as a main keyboard? i am running out of combinations on my trusty old butterfly keyboard. pls help.",
        "answer": "ok, 2 very important things i have to say about this. 1, yes, you can absolutely use additional keyboards with kbm, all with their own separate keys. i'm currently using 9 keyboards. i will explain the trick i discovered for doing that. but the other important thing i must tell you first is that if you start including wireless keyboards in your setup, you will be in agony city. i had 3 wireless keyboards in the setup and it was a disaster. it's occasionally annoying when a bluetooth keyboard disconnects, but if you have 4 bluetooth keyboards it's going to happen 4 times more often. actually more, because bluetooth just gets messed up when you have too many. i returned all the wireless keyboards and went for wired keyboards only. much more reliable. Ok, now that that hint/tip is out of the way, the secret for getting additional keyboards in kbm is first get Karabiner Elements (this is a key-swapping software). But instead of swapping keys, you are actually going to disable every key. (set it to \"vk disable\".) this may take a while if you go through the popup menus, but if you open the json file you can change it via the text all in one shot (with a little help from kbm of course). Once you have all the keys disabled, go into keyboard maestro and when you make your trigger, instead of \"Hot Key\" trigger, use \"USB device key\" trigger, press a button and it will come right up. This works for almost any keyboard you can imagine, even PC keyboards (although you may never get the function key.) Another secret tip that i will tell you is, if extra keyboards don't work when you first try, or if they don't work when you first boot up, just put the computer to sleep then wake it up. quickest way is to go to the lock screen and then unlock (and i've now zapped that with a macro). only have to do it if i restart, otherwise they work forever. it took me a while to figure that out, i thought they mysteriously just didn't work until i went to lunch. email me if you need any more tips, i have learned a lot so far, and it's a strange world, and i've run into a lot of things i didn't expect, but overall it's been much easier than i expected, considering what i've seen Tom Scott and Taran Van Hemert had to go through. and i'm not even sure if peternlewis is even aware that what i'm doing is possible"

'pan' is how far left or right the sound is. actually most music in stereo has all the parts positioned in slightly different places, not just exactly center. occasionally for special effects it is fun to throw something all the way to one side to give the impression that it is outside commentary on the song, instead of actually in the song. also it was not written in the song, it was probably something i came up with when recording the vocal"

        "question": "I've read somewhere that you've had a lifelong passion for music beginning at a very early age (I believe the source I read quoted you as saying something along the lines of \"I started banging on pots and pans in the kitchen when I was 2, and it all sort of started from there\", but correct me if I've been misinformed). Do you think that someone like me, who is discovering a passion for music in high school, has any chance of achieving the skills to reach the heights you have?",
        "answer": "that's true not true. i never tried any pots or pans until i was maybe 7, long after i had started music, and it was only on one occasion, and it was not in the kitchen, and i was tapping them at moderate to respectable volume ranges i only know what it's like to learn music starting extremely early. i have no idea what it's like to start later"

        "question": "i hate the idea of treating yourself or deserving a break and i dont know why. i aim to treat myself and have a break all the time if i can and i dont do anything to deserve living like that unless i get a job and thats strange because i cant commit to that kind of work and i quit my last job after a week cause i can't stand doing anything when im tired and i hate the word treat because i used to assume it had to be food related so if it came in a form of a surprise i expected it to be tasty and sometimes it wasn't even edible and i'd be disappointed so think that ties back to not being able to enjoy anything that lasts a long time. recently i stopped going to my classes and i write a to do list for myself every day and in the last few days i wrote a dozen songs and it makes me a lot happier than acting like i care about school but i don't think music is going to work out for me once i run out of money because by that time still no one has listene d to my music. and i want people to pay attention me so badly but admitting that discourages them from giving any recognition which i feel like i need in order to survive",

And yet, render still takes 1/2 second per frame, at 16 samples. much much better than cycles, but the mystery still persists as to what should stop me from just screenrecording the viewport for perfect instant results ....... and yet the render still needs to compute .... To push this mystery a little bit further, still on eevee, i've set the render sample rate to 1, (!!!) the render still is completely noise free and looks great, (???) and does about 3 frames per second. The viewport preview, however, i've just set to 500 samples (!!!), and it still renders absolutely instantly. ?????? it's got to be aliens"

Like, once you get past 10 nonillion or so, the number you're talking about is so large that there is no meaningful comparison for it in the universe. The largest numbers ever used constructively are Graham's Number and tree(3), both so unbelievably large that the number of digits in the number of digits in the number of digits in them can't be imagined. Yet there are always numbers larger. In fact, considering all the natural numbers in a row, these numbers are functionally no different than 0 in terms of how close to the end you are.

        "question": "11.3.19 1:58 am Wow! That's very encouraging. I know letter chords like C, Am, Fmaj7, Gadd9, etc. And the Nashville number system; like 1 is the root, 2m, 3,4,5 6m, etc. and I understand tempo and keeping time and basic time signature. But as for music sheets with music notes, I can't play by that. I just hear and I play. All that being said, would it benefit me to learn how to read and write music to further expand my knowledge?",
        "answer": "well then congratulations, you are fluent, literate, and industry-ready nowadays with recordings so readily available, the importance of completely knowing notation is nothing of what it used to be. there used to be no records, so in order to even listen to music, you had to buy sheet music from the store and play it on the piano. but nowadays, even in a professional setting, if you're learning material, even if you CAN read full notation, it would be actually very irresponsible to not listen to a recording also, because no matter how good the notation is, there's still layers and layers of depth to the music that can never be accurately represented on paper. it depends what kind of work you are doing, but in almost every modern professional musical situation, if you know chord symbols, (and the relative number systems are a huge bonus also), and have good ears to go with it, that's an A grade professional package right there. with the possibly the specific exception of the world of classical orchestral music. Also it may be different if your main instrument is a lead instrument - in that case you might want to know how to read melodies. And in general, i would recommend learning rhythmic notation, because often you will see rhythmic figures written in charts, and also it will be a very valuable tool when talking about the material with other musicians, you can refer to different rhythmic figures. and it would also help to know the names of the notes"

        "question": "i remember when i saw blue man group at age, like, 10 or 11 and i laughed so hard i cried. frickin loved every second of it. so i got my dad to buy me the dvd they were selling at the merch stand. but there was a bit in the dvd that wasn't in the live performance that involved a clip of some lady gagging and barfing into a vacuum like tube funnel thing. i'm severely, severely emetophobic and immediately ran out of the room covering my ears and hyperventilating and i haven't been able to bring myself to watch anything related to blue man group since. which sucks and i realize if i continue having this reaction to all forms of entertainment that have barf in them, i will eventually have a serious problem with limiting my options. also i don't wanna go to therapy over this if i can avoid it because being psychoanalyzed rubs me the wrong way for some reason. do you have any advice on how i can unfuck my reactions so i can enjoy stuff without worried abo ut unexp ectedly being thrown into a vortex of soul-eating, brain-screaming panic and horror? thanks",

But what I do is I compare the note to a pre-selected list of songs, and I can tell the note's pitch by what song it matches. It's not always snap-instant, but I can usually get at least a half-step around the true note. And these songs are ones I have only discovered very recently. So my question: does being able to remember and sing a song in key count as, or at least approximate, absolute pitch?",

        "question": "Is your internal \"soundtrack-of-your-life\" similar to your musical style? Or does your day-to-day life journey have a different vibe/tone? Is your musical style just your \"life's work\" (object of your journey) or is it closer to being a reflection of your experience in life (representation of your subjective journey)? One possibility I've found myself considering is that your music represents a mix between your efforts to 1. refocus your attention on what will keep your outlook positive and bring you closer to your goals, and 2. recontextualize the internal and external challenges you face in a way that allows you to face them in an arena of your choosing. But I'm doing a hell of a lot of projecting here. Slightly unrelated. I know you don't like listening to your finished music because of superstition-related reasons, but does this keep you from singing and pla ying old songs just for the enjoyment of it? needless to say, if you don't feel like answering the questions themselves but you have some thoughts I'd love to hear em. Thx Bill!",
        "answer": "usually it's whatever the last song i heard, that song imprinted in my brain and won't stop until i hear a different song, or think of a different song i just try to write stuff that would blow my mind if i heard it for the first time. whether or not i have ever succeeded in that, is open to debate it's more enjoyable to play new songs, or to play other people's old songs, in a new way. it would also be enjoyable to play my own songs in a new way, but we'll save that for the stage, with the band"

        "question": "So I'm working on preparing to work with multiple cover bands and I've found that unless there's Charts, nobody knows what to do because they haven't listened to the recording. which sucks, but that's just all who's available to me where i Live. I just want to know (because I have wet dreams about this) Do the pros REALLY just give the band members a playlist of the setlist and then leave it up to the individual Bandmembers to transcribe and execute their part? because I've been writing EVERYBODYS part down in the group and it's exhausting and time consuming. and in the end the people I'm working with are only up to tackle five tunes a week. and it just feels like: \"I have three hours of material(One+half written). At this pace I'm never gonna get to perform live.\" \"how do you climb out of hell?\" is my question I guess.",
        "answer": "professionals should be able to learn much more than 5 songs a week, especially if they are allowed to read. many people prefer to make their own charts. they should be able to read charts as well, but even if they are good readers, no chart can actually explain exactly how a song is supposed to sound. so even with charts, you have to listen to the song to get the full picture. it's interesting that you can only find readers who won't listen, because i've found it's much more common to find people who listen, try to memorize, and don't even write things down because they can't read"

Also I have some people telling me not to worry about it and just relax. Maybe it's better for my mental health, but by god that would feel like a waste. Thoughts?",

        "question": "11.8.19 3:47 pm if im willing to put in 5 years to learn 3 or 4 instruments, and the level of good i want to get is about to the level where if i started busking people would hear me and they would say something like \"wow youre really really good\" and then they give 20 dollars. and that repeats with lots or people that walk by. though i think tou might need some more factors to understand if i should pursue music, such as my singing voice. my singing voice is naturally pretty good (for reference it sounds very similar to your voice, but when singing it sounds different to the point where its unique) my voice is suited for more rock and pop type somgs, but i could also try hip hop type songs, but my voice can not do the growling thing that tends to happen in metal songs. i have a keyboard with 61 keys, (though im poor so its not very good) i hope to learn simple songs, and then everything necassa ry for m y journey to success. i know a bit about basic music theory but i dont know how to put it down and do things, and i dont have the muscle memory to always hit the notes im trying to on triads, because i havent even done any real practice. i cant afford lessons right now. i can picture myself being successful to exactlty the degree i want, but i dont know how to get there, or where to start my journey. i havent been involved with music from a young age. my confidence level is about 60%, but when i get my journey started it will definitely be atleast 90%. based on all these factors would it be a good idea to pursue music? sorry for writing a very long question, i just had so many things i wanted to say. thank you",
        "answer": "you can never plan how many instruments you are going to learn. learning an instrument changes your life. once you learn that instrument, it will change everything, including the exact number of instruments you will want to learn after that there is another factor, which is how much you enjoy doing all the things you plan on doing. so first you must calculate how much you are going to enjoy all these things, that way you'll know if you should do them"

        "answer": "my thing has always been to make the content off youtube, and then post it on youtube (and my website, and maybe other video sites if it makes sense.) i think it's pretty hard to actually make videos ON youtube, you can get much better tools off youtube. but speaking of tools, my previous tools were banished from society because they were too old (that's my mistake, they were already almost banished when i first started using them and i somehow failed to notice) so that's interesting news because now i don't have the old tools but the great news is the new tools are ridiculous. the only problem is it took me years to learn how to use the old tools and it will take me years to learn how to use these. but they are ridiculous. and i'm sure i will start releasing things well before i know what the hell i'm doing. that's just company policy"

        "question": "Good to know you're still alive and well, can't wait to see what you'll do with your new software. Gosh so many questions and words to say, hopefully I can express them to you in a reasonable manner lol. I want to be like you, I want to make music and I want to make people happy and entertained like you but I don't know where to start. I just started my life and it feels like I still don't have enough time. I love playing the ukulele, guitar, tenor guitar, and piano (I want to pick up the bass and drums too lmao) but I am really bad at most of them and I don't feel as if I can master them quick enough, and I feel like it'd be too late for me to get lessons on them. As well as I have loads of recording of songs that I have started but I don't know what to do with them, I don't have any type of recording or editing software, and I don't even know what type to get. It feels like I'm just stuck in this hole of, \"I want to do it, but I don't have the means t o do it. \" And I really want to try to make music for a living. I really hope this hasn't gotten too confusing, but I want to be a successful musician, like you, but I don't know where to start or what to do, and you're one of the only famous people who like actually responds to, pretty much, all of their fans. Do you have any tips on what I should do, or where I should start or anything? P. S. Sorry for making you read this long lol",
        "answer": "keep writing songs, recording them, and figure out what's going to play on the screen while the song plays. if you think you can make a video, that's cool too. but if you can't, just designate something interesting to look at on the screen while your song is playing. and make a bunch of video files that have your song on it, with the visual. keep doing that, and make your own channel (even if it's just on your hard drive). keep a notebook, give updates, record commentary, ...... basically make your own tv show. and then after it has gone on for a few months or a year or so, whenver you are feeling ready, start looking around at various online platforms you like best, and make accounts there and start posting the content there. it's pretty much a steady staircase to success, if you start treating yourself like the star of your own show, immediately. i am just guessing at what you might be interested in, because you said \"like you\" (me), and pretty much what i do is i star in my own imaginary show, and then when i feel like the show is good enough i start posting it online. pretty cool"
