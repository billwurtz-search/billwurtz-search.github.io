        "question": "have you ever tried to make a list of all the chords you could think of that could harmonize the note C or is it impractical?",
        "answer": "sometimes it can be a nice exercise to put the same C in the melody and then try every bass note and then find all the best ways of filling in the harmony from there. it can be useful to know. there will never be a firm dividing line between what you can and can't do, but if you have C as the melody you'll want to know you about Ab maj, F maj, Gsus4, C over E, Dmin7, Dbmaj7, Eb6, F#min7b5 or F#dim, Amin, Amin7, Bbsus2, F/Bb, Fmin/Bb, Bbmaj9, Bbmin9, Bb9, Ab7, Ab6, Abmaj7, F over G, Bbsus2/G, Fsus4, Fsus2, F over A, Fmaj7, Fmin7, Eb13, Ebmin6, D7, D7sus4,..... that's about everything that i could come up with that seems reasonable. But any actual moment in a real song is going to render most of those wrong and a handful of them right, or possibly requiring something not listed here. On an actual songwriting situation, if you find yourself in a scenario where you'd find yourself using this type of logic to find the right chord, i find it usually means you've lost touch with the song at that particular moment. mechanics usually are not what is gonna produce the answers you want, at least in a music/song situation. for that you have to rely on pure magic/miracles, unfortunately"

        "question": "I sing for fun (but not in front of anyone because I just started recently) and I keep hearing words like \"pitch\" and \"tuning\" being thrown around which I don't really understand, plus idk anything about music theory, so I was wondering how to improve. It also doesn't help that I only get to sing when the house is empty, which is maybe only twice a week. I also really want to play the piano ever since I messed around with it a few times in the past but I don't have access to it now and my parents are pretty discouraging when it comes to music because they think it's useless and will only distract me further and isn't profitable enough to bring food to the table, so I definitely can't convince them to buy one anytime soon, nor do I know a close friend who owns a piano (probably because I don't have many friends). I want to get involved with music but I'm currently studying engineering (which I'm also passionate about), which is extremely hard to handle as it is without bringing music into the picture. I think I spend a good chunk of my waking hours listening to music in the background, but I'm kind of reluctant to explore music theory not only because it's kind of inaccessible but also because once I dig too deep I just become entrenched in it and I don't want to become even more distracted from my studies. The education system in my country also holds this suffocating disdain for anything related to the arts and music, so there aren't many opportunities/resources that I know of. I'm still pretty optimistic about taking up music as a hobby, but the pressure and competition in academics will only increase in the next few years, making it even harder to give time to basically anything else I might be interested in. Anyway, complaining aside, I just need a few tips on how I could build on any crucial skills I might need for playing an instrument or singing because I've had zero training in anything related to music (due to the aforemention ed shitty education system). Also, sorry for making this unnecessarily long (I wanted to give the proper context for my situation).",
        "answer": "you're going to have to find something to play. basically the only way you can expand your musical/artistic knowledge and skills is by actually 'playing' with things. that may seem like bad news if you feel like you don't have the time or resources. but i can tell you that even people who have 10 times more time and resources than you still feel like it's not enough. so just focus on whatever is within your time and resources, and begin developing a playful attitude within that space as soon as possible. music can be made with spoons if necessary"

I'm kind of stuck in this state of mind where I'm thinking I can't \"just write a melody\" but instead, I have to do it in a certain way. I see the way Elton John and Billy Joel and Freddie Mercury seem to just sit down and try something a few times and it's good, but they are all obviously very knowledgeable in music. I know it's not true, but I'm having trouble breaking away from this idea that I need to know more before I even try to write a good melody. Anyways, do you have any advice on how to stop trying to mould my writing procedure on somebody else's? Thanks so much bill",
        "answer": "have you seen them do it? i would be curious to see that coming up with melodies is mysterious. i think anyone who does it would agree.... including probably the people you mentioned. there's nothing to know about it, besides just knowing how unknowable it is, so at least that way you won't be scared of how unknown it can be"

It has one flat, starts on a D minor chord but resolves most of the time to F major, however, it resolves to a D minor at the very end. So, to the point, do I write the numerals in terms of the minor key (i-ii\u00b0-III-iv-v-VI-VII) or the major key (I-ii-iii-IV-V-vi-vii\u00b0)? Thanks so much",
        "answer": "i personally don't use roman numerals because they make my eyes hurt, but, in terms of deciding whether your minor root is called 1 or 6..... it's your choice. it's like choosing what you want for breakfast, which i understand is easier said than done"

By placing this in 1900, it's giving you an alternate view of the same story from an earlier point in time, and it also gives you the listener the sensation of actually being in the future, as you are listening to it more than 100 years later. so it hopefully rings especially true that times did change and indeed still are"

        "question": "in when I get older, you say when you're older you'll be more truthful. around 3 years later, meaning you're 3 years older, you say \"today I woke up telling the truth\" in more than a dream. therefore, you're older and more truthful. was this intentional?",
        "answer": "it was intentional to make each of the songs like that. but not for any reason related to each other. i have a habit of singing about the truth, because it...... seems so real. But if you look at the 'when i get older song', you can trace the reasoning differently. the reason 'truthful' is there, is it's clearly an answer to the previous lines about being a liar. And the reason the word 'liar' is there is, clearly, it's what follows naturally after the line \"when i get younger\". Because obviously no one's gonna get younger. so obviously if you say you've gotten younger then you're presumably a liar. And the way the \"when i get younger\" line comes about, is, just a simple songwriting tactic of taking the already established first line (\"when i get older\") and choosing the natural alternative options. older --> younger. So you can see, the whole existence of the word 'truthful' in that verse is clearly the result of a very logical chain of songwriting best-practices"

In Chicago (where I lived for a while) there's different neighborhoods (wrigleyville, uptown, south loop, etc) how are these neighborhoods different from burroughs? Also, how do addresses work? If I lived in Brooklyn, would my street address be: 123 Main Street Brooklyn, New York Or 123 Main Street Brooklyn, New York City, New York Or 123 Main Street New York City, New York",
        "answer": "i think it's a 'borough' and i'm not sure exactly what it is the boroughs are way bigger. they have many neighborhoods in them. some of them have multiple towns in them for that one, it's Brooklyn, New York. Brooklyn is actually a town. It's also the exact same territory as the county of \"Kings\". \"Queens\" county (also a borough), is different in the sense that queens is not a town. it has towns in it, such as Astoria, Maspeth, Elmhurst, etc... New York, New York i think specifically refers to manhattan. There is also another way that somehow \"New York City\" refers to all 5 counties, but i don't think that has anything to do with an address. it's weird, but so is..... everything"

D natural is literally a note in Bdim Ab note is in Bdim7 also. so in your line of thinking, everything seems 'legal', although that's not always what counts in songs where time flows along in a forwardly direction"

Do I use no sharp and no flat, because that would work, or do I use G major with one sharp, and use a natural before every f?

But this final transcription is being typed in real time, and you can see the exact time it took by taking the difference of the time between the time stamps. i should mention that i might be a bit slower than normal because my fingernails need cutting and also my hands are a bit cold.Saturday, January 8, 2022 3:18:08 PM"

By placing this in 1900, it's giving you an alternate view of the same story from an earlier point in time, and it also gives you the listener the sensation of actually being in the future, as you are listening to it more than 100 years later. so it hopefully rings especially true that times did change and indeed still are"

        "question": "so okay please hear me out; my go-to songwriting method is finding the inspiration at some point of my jam sessions, playing it for a couple of minutes while growing it, the whole deal, giving it the correct amount of water, moonlight, sunlight, etc... then i do the same thing for more and more jam sessions, different days, months, maybe years, and let the song finish itself without any haste. this has been going on for a couple of years. i use a guitar for that. after this pseudo procedural progress finally settles in the place where i know the progression and melodies by-heart, i start to think of other things while playing it over and over, the bass, the other melodies, the cool stuff that goes around, the transitions, etc.. after a while, something liminally similar to what the song is going to be like is recorded down in my head, naturally. i can't write any kind of music down if saying \"da-da dummm d'dree da! da-da dumm d'dree da da-da-dumm dp ts dm dpdp ts dm dpdpdpdpdpdp\" will not resemble the intro of \"i wanna hold your hand\" by beatles to you, which i doubt......... (this is supposed to be a joke that has been written after the whole text is finished since i feel guilty about asking a SERIOUS!!!!question that is 2362 sentences long.) i may write the lyrics down depending on my knowledge of their music and that's all. and i dont give a damn about not being able to do this since i am not going to \"show\" my music instead of playing it somehow anyways. so the closest thing to keeping them down that i have, is recording that sessions with my cellphone, which now has 4236426427624 unnamed voice recordings which seems impossible to quarry now........ anyways, now that i have many songs that feel complete by-heart, i want to have some better demos. not \"sonudingbetter\" demos but demos that show more about the work. which needs a daw for more layers, which i have. the problem i s, whenever i open it and have my connections ready, my hand just does not go to my songs to play. its some kind of fear that is not actually fear? maybe a fear of redundance i dont know. i just want to add the layers that are in my head but never heard since i am only one person and have only recorded them live. how can i get over this things? whenever i open the daw i just play a song from my streaming services and play things over them, find some silly guitar effects and experiment on them, but my hands never want to press the record button and play the whole progression just once and then play some other things on them which is the only thing i need. whenever i start thinking about that, my mind goes crazy about what-ifs, and i see myself getting lost in the muddiness of my ears understanding why the recordings suck but my hands have no idea how to try and fix it with my unwhole knowledge about the frequencies... i dont even want them to be ready-to-go songs right now, thats one of the next couple of steps. i just want them to represent what i have in my heart and head in a better manner. i have been trying to start this for a long time... how can i start doing this? should i learn to how to write music down someway? will it be a good tool to have in my pocket, depending on my problems? it just seems like i just got to start somehow, but i just cant... you seem like a person who can understand me about this, any and every kind of insight from you is appreciated. i love every single thing you had ever done. at least the things that were somehow presented to me, and a great source of inspiration. please help................",
        "answer": "ah, i think i see what's happening here. the reason you are so afraid, is because of how much you care. you care about it so much so it sometimes makes you so afraid so everything becomes almost impossible, for one reason or another. also the volume/velocity of your thinking seems to be very high. all of this is just how you are. this can be a great advantage in music, but the downside is exactly what you've described: the constant feeling of drowning in confusion over how to find a procedure that works, given seemingly infinite possibilities. and also enough fear to shut down the whole operation at any moment. but you have the answers. you may feel like you may need to write 10,000 more pages discussing it (actually more like 2 million pages, probably)..... and you may do this. and you will probably try things a lot of different possible ways, trying to figure out what makes sense for you. actually i can see you've already done a lot of it. and you'll do more of it. and sometimes you'll be afraid and confused enough to think there's no possible way. but of course, there's plenty of ways, the problem being perhaps that there's way way too many ways. but you're eventually going to get around to finding all the answers you'll ever need, and more, because, no matter how bad or confused you get on this, i'm pretty sure you're not gonna stop trying to figure it out"

        "question": "In I'm a princess, when you said, \"do you love me? Or have things gone astray?\" Who were you talking to?",
        "answer": "no one, i was writing a song. but, the reason both of those lines are there, now that i look at it, those are both early heightening moves. first it's \"i'm a princess\" which is basically just a title/phrase. the second line introduces emotions/issues like desires, wants, even some guilt. The 3rd line (\"do you love me\") heightens again because it's the first mention of relational feelings to/from another person. Then the 4th line ('have things gone astray') heightens again because it suddenly indicates that the relationship has a history. so in 4 lines we've gone from meme/clickbait to a whole slew of longterm emotions/situations to deal with. At least this is my best analysis of what seems to be going on there"

        "answer": "yes i give the best answer i can, if i can. sometimes i skip. i don't feel guilty for that, because many of them i do answer the best way around this, i've found, is to simultaneously pretend that i am and am not everything is everything, so, even knowing just 1 thing, technically that would amount to knowing it all. but still there's everything else, which i don't know. and even that 1 bit of thing that i do know keeps changing, so then suddenly i don't know it that's not true"

I've listened to the Beatles, Queen, Elton John, etc, the legends, y'know? And while their stuff is good, it's not \"incredible\", like my first artist. Do I have expectations that are too high to compete with, or am I just lucky to have one artist I love so much, and give up on that ever happening again? I don't know why it gets me so worked up, but I figured it was worth asking you. Have a great day man, thanks",

        "question": "I wrote a chorus to a song half a year ago and I have been trying to think of a verse ever since, but i can't think of one. I have an outro and a bridge that go with the chorus, but a verse just eludes me. The problem is, the song starts with the chorus, and i really like the chorus, so i can't think of anything that i like enough to come after it",
        "answer": "from the way you explained it, it almost sounds like your 'bridge' should come after the chorus. but if that doesn't work, try doing a brief vamp and then jump back into the chorus with slightly different lyrics the second time. i have no idea if any of this will work because i haven't heard any of the material you're working with. but here's another idea: use the verse to try to explain how and why you came up with the part you already have. but don't forget to check if it already just works with only what you have. if it really doesn't want to go back to the chorus, and if it really can't go to the bridge after the first chorus, then maybe you can just figure out the minimum amount you could do before it feels ok to back to the chorus. it's like one of those fun rooms, where you go out the exit door and then everyone just goes directly around to the entrance and goes in again"

        "question": "MIGHT QUIT ANALYSIS: \"it's the first day of school\" college? \"and i think i might quit cuz the things i've been seeing in here don't make sense\" you've been disillusioned by the system and the curriculum, they're not teaching you what you want to know \"so i packed up my things and i walked thru the door and i'm going somewhere else instead\" you're going somewhere else to learn \"so i chopped down some trees and i built a small house\" this is about autonomy and independence, and also again the romance of creating things on your own. \"and i just might be small enough to live in it\" you don't desire much materialistically-- you are small enough to live in this small house without complaining about it \"then the rain came pouring down and it made some cool sounds and i'll tell you what those sounds said\" very good lyrical moment. were these lines inspired by an actual rainy day? \"(said) hello and goodbye\" hello and goodbye is an odd sort of cool sounding phrase, so that's why it's there. \"do you feel alright with the days gone by\" 'are you fine? do you have any regrets?' \"i'll never waste my time\" of course. \"i'll never say goodbye yes i will but i won't say it tonight\" this is about the ephemerality of life as an artist: i'm never gonna stop creating-- well, i will, but not today. \"so i picked a new character and i've just chose my shirt\" videogame-ish imagery. also how did you pronounce charactr here krktr chrhct krktkrc \"and i'm going to the land of the 2 letter words on in up at or so, by if to of no it\" it's a feeling we can't forget\" great \"hello and goodnight do you feel alriiiight do you remember the days gone by\" ah, is this like you from the past? \"do you rem ember the way that we dreamed we could change our lives do you feel like changing your mind\" do you have any regrets, future me? do you remember our dreams? \"it's the first day of school and i think i might quit cuz the things that i'm feeling still don't make sense\" i can relate to this one too \"and i've tried to explain and it hurts to describe\" certainly. saying it directly is sort of uncomfortable. so i'll sing this song instead\" music reaches into a more comfortable place in our souls i suppose [instrumental melody] \"hello and goodbye\" great. this is you replying to your past self, in the same way your past self called out to you-- you havent changed in the little ways \"do you think i'm dying do you think i'm going somewhere else this time\" i'm fine. i'm fine. \"do you remember the day we pretended to be every star in the sky\" beautiful. not even going to stain this line with my analysis \"it's the first day of school but i think might quit\" coming back home musically, and: \"gonna learn some new lessons i won't forget\" \"gonna write them all down in the language of love\" music \"and then teach them to everyone\" you want to inspire everyone. which you have.",
        "answer": "could be any school, but i suppose most of the metaphors that come later would probably be most relatable if it's a college/university that sounds about right. except keep in mind, this song is not specifically about 'me'. it's about anyone who feels they have been through something that feels like this yep surely surely no. it just seems like the forces of nature should assert themselves here, upon the previous situation of becoming situated right i confess that the music was driving the lyrics here, which is not ideal, but, your meaning is certainly correct pretty much. again, the music is driving the lyrics here, but surely this meaning is accurate right it's \"character\", in 1 syllable. it may seem like it's not going to fit, but it can be done with a little courage i'm not sure why this line is different from the previous chorus. actually i think i have an idea: given that i'd already pronounced \"alriiiight\" longer like that, the first chorus version wouldn't have fit. so that's probably what altered the course of things. i'd say that's about right that's true the actual explanation for this line here is much more simple. it's just the same as it was before, because it's been established that that's how the song goes already. i'm commonly guilty of altering too many lines from chorus to chorus, and not having enough things repeated the same. but in this case i was able to keep it inside the box maybe this was just late-song itch setting in. feeling restless well then i will. i think on this line i'm terribly guilty of letting the music drive the lyric. i was clearly chasing some flashy key changes, and the lyrics were just tagging along for the ride as best they could right that's true i'll see what i can do"

        "question": "Hi Bill, can you help me? I finished my first album a year ago (just the music, without lyrics, but with a clear singable melody). The thing is that since then I've been heavily struggling to write lyrics to those melodies. (The album hasn't been published yet) I know what each song should talk about. I perfectly know what each song should make me feel (lyricaly). But everytime i sit down to actually write the lyrics I freeze up and nothing comes. I feel like I could have avoided this whole situation if the songs had been composed with lyrics from the first place, but sadly that's not how this songs came to life. I know that one solution would be to keep them as they are, without lyrics. but there's a clear message i want to express in every song, and leaving them like that would not help me to reach that goal. any advice on this problem? Thanks Bill, your work means so much to me",
        "answer": "this may seem inconvenient, but the best solutions always seem to arrive when you literally thought you were not working on it. when you're not even thinking about it. But, as long as you are trying, what you can do is just start putting any words on it, and keep trying different things. eventually if you do this enough, you'll probably get sick of it and stop thinking about it and then the answers will be right there"

So in that case, if you're wishing to solve that, i would suggest to just move forward and just create many things, 'anything', and allow it to be 'wrong' on purpose. if you can get up the courage to do that, then that will get you into the game, and then the real magic will find you surprisingly quickly"

        "question": "hey there's a few questions i have about this song: SLOW DOWN ANALYSIS \"look at the time, upon the wall the clock is tellin it all wrong you got to slow down you got to slow down slow it right off the wall you got to slow down\" stop rushing. \"my hat is bent oh, i got a bent hat maybe i'll slow down and straighten it out\" continued from the previous verse, when things aren't as they should be, the solution is to slow down, stop rushing-- that's what will right the wrongs. \"and then twist it all around then put it down\" doing things badly on purpose, and then letting them go for a while before you get back to straightening them out \"and i'm bobblin down 124th street and i think i'm bobblin to a brighter day\" optimism \"and the radio's playing a different kind of music and the universe is starting t o shake\" different music=change= brighter day shake=change=brighter day \"look at the time, it's 12;30 i'm going to hell, and i'm late for it\" if you can people feel good about something bad, then you're bulletproof in life. \"but i'll slow down and talk about it\" going back home lyrically to say 'slowing down's gonna right your wrongs.' this is your dissonant optimism at work: you're pretending you can SLOW DOWN to fix BEING LATE, but your conviction regarding this is so strong that you just might be right. \"and the world goes round and then comes back down\" could you talk about this a little? i'll assume this line's meant to lead musically into the instrumental verse [instrumental verse] \"now i'm swingin about my every daily business and i'm pondering out about how it's daily been\" alright alright \"and it's easy to feel if you're useless but it's strange wh en you tell your friends\" yeah. it's hard to sincerely admit your flaws without veiling it behind irony \"so i re-loaded my fax machine with some fresh clean paper so i can slow down and have a slow time printing it out\" fax machine is sort of odd, so that's why it's here. i don't understand what the verse MEANS, but i'm liking it texturally and rhythmically. slowing down printing out faxes is revisiting the slowing down for being late to hell idea, i.e. it isn't something you really want to do, but it's something YOU would want to do. \"then the roof blew off again and it came back down\" parallel lyrically to the previous verse. could you talk about these two lines a little? thanks \"and hurricaines and storms cover the landscape and the picture frames are floating off the wall and the hourglass is twisting a little bit sideways and the neighbourhood is all gone\" first: beautiful vocals second: this is the apocalyptic nature of your works REALLY standing out-- you're bulletproof in life, truly third: the hourglass is twisting sideways, meaning time is SLOWING DOWN, which means everything will be alright? \"look at the time, on the wall cuz it's going very very really slowly now\" beautiful beautiful beautiful, this entire verse, and i love how the lead in to it feels like we've been 'submerged' musically somehow. great. time is going slowly now because of the 'apocalypse?' \"and it's the only thing that anybody ever talks about and the scientists are always trying to figure out and the physicists are always letting it bounce around\" i'll talk about these three lines at the end of the verse. including an instrumental line in this entire twelve-line verse is a great choice musically, even though i don't know anything about music. this balances out the verse. freshens it up. makes people go 'ooh. let's see what's going on.' i'm not a musician but does it mean something that the instrumental line is the sixth line? like does it have anything to do with those timing things the uh TIME SIGNATURE? because like i think a waltz goes: du DU DU du DU DU du DU DU which is a regular rhythm or something and what you've done with your verse here is go: 1 2 3, 1 2 [IRREGULARITY]. \"and the novelists are typically writing stories about it and the journalists are usually breaking news about it and the pharmacists are frequently making drugs about it and the charities are always raising money for it\" i think this entire verse is trying to evoke that 'diagonal' quality to it. great great great. \"and the client's name is always there and [client's name] always cares\" beautiful end to the song. somehow you've gotten 'back home' musically not by returning to the same place but by.. . creating a new home?!?!?",
        "answer": "ironically i couldn't, because i was under enormous time pressure to write the song. but that's a coincidence in this particular song, \"slow down\" is a purely musical phrase. the lyrical content is actually not what i wanted to say at the time. and i tried very hard to come up with something else besides 'slow down'. but 'slow down' was the first and only good thing i could find that sounded right. to put it in context, 'slow down' was the first actual lyric i got, and the only other thing i knew was i wanted it to be a blues sequence (the chords going how they go, in those verse sections), with the 'title' being at that location (where 'slow down' is). and the first and only thing i could come up with was 'slow down', sung in that way. that's just the only thing that seemed to fit. i tried to come up with something else because it didn't 'seem' like the most interesting concept i could come up with. but i couldn't find anything else that worked as well. so i had to write the whole song around that sure. that's one of the worst lines in the song. you can see with most of this, i seemed to slip into this sort of \"A A B\" sectionality, where i do a couple of verses, then bounce to a bridge, then do a couple more verses, then another bridge, and back. i mean, it's not bad to do that, it's just in some points it kind of feels like it's on auto-pilot. It's likely that that line \"world goes round and then comes back down\" seems to represent the feeling of cycling through these song sections in this way. i changed my mind: this is the worst part of the song. i wish i could have done better. the goal-post here should be to make this have the same sort of high-flying 'sail' that the first bridge had (124th street). unfortunately i was unable to live up to this right. i think after the previous bridge seemed to get us into a bland rut, i think i was reaching toward something more playful yes, i definitely think it reflects the sensation of cycling through these A and B sections of the song. over, and over, and over, and over again. i was lucky i was able to barely squeak by with something mildly original in this section. everyone can see we're dangerously close to being in a serious rut of just cycling over the form like a zombie this part is the breakthrough, because as you can see i've finally freed myself from the prison of the never-ending sort of AABA paradigm the rest of the song has been in it's going slowly now (in a nice way) because i've finally broken out of that damn form, from before. and it just feels really good. new melodies, new content, new chords, it's like when you spend 80% of the party in 1 room and you've gotten bored of it and then you move into a new room that you never saw for the other 80% of the time it looks like i'm so glad to be in this section, i just wanna let it go around forever it seems to be on the 5th line. which is after 4 lines. in this case, the 4 lines feels like a complete unit. but the truth is, i really wanna just keep these going and stay in this section. but there's a chance that maybe i shouldn't stay any longer ...... so i guess i throw it to a musical riff because obviously i still have that melody in my head, and then the fact that we leave after 1 shows that even though we briefly considered leaving, what we really want to do is double down and stay i suppose in a way, perhaps i had 'paid my dues' through the rest of the song because i had basically been feeling slightly uncomfortable/skeptical about just keeping the AABA form for so long. it felt good the first time around, but after that, there was always this skepticism about just drilling around the form like that. Was decidedly the best option at the time, but still gave me this nagging feeling of unfulfillment throughout. So it really felt refreshing to hit that outtro (everything after \"very slowly now\", up to the end), and that rush was enough to keep me out of the worry zone, all the way until the end"

        "question": "while reading the lyrics in the questions the last few days, i noticed how vividly i had remembered your songs. as i read the words on the screen i instantly heard the melody and a whole bunch of the other stuff really easily. now i don't have perfect pitch, but when i went and checked the songs to see i was always exactly on pitch as well. this happens to me sometimes with other people's songs when i play them in my head (which i do all the time) but with yours it seems i have a much better chance. usually i can't tell at all if i'm playing a song in the wrong key in my head though, but reading your lyrics made it super vivid. it's not that i think they have to be in one key, but when i hear you singing it in my head it my memory is just especially vivid. i think i remember you saying you always do a range test for your songs. might this be part of it? i think a lot of other music i listen to is made before someone sings \"over\" it and that probably results with people singing something in a way that could have been expressed better slightly higher or lower. also interesting because i am not usually a person who digests lyrics easily. i'm terrible at remembering them, but as soon as i read them the song sprung to life",
        "answer": "no, i think what's happening is you have very strong sonic memory of these recordings, probably because you've heard them a lot. i've noticed that it's pretty common for people to remember the absolute pitch of familiar recordings. in fact, it might even be more common with non-musicians, because musicians might specifically train themselves so well on the relative that they almost willfully disregard the absolute"

        "question": "I ask you questions on here from time to time and I always try to make the question unique or novel in some way. But I've realized now after skimming through years of answered questions that it's pretty likely that every question or comment you receive has already been sent before. This question page is almost like a microcosm of how nearly everything in the world has already been thought up or dreamed of before, just because of sheer numbers and probability. And it hit me that even this observation has likely already been made to you before - I bet even this question isn't unique, and the meta narrative I'm writing now has all been done before as well. So now I have to ask: have you received a question and observation like this before?",
        "answer": "that's generally tends to be true of course everything in the world has been thought of. but what about everything that's not yet in the world? there's way more of that, and none of it's been thought of there seem to be 2 themes in this question ('all questions have been asked before', and 'everything in the world has been done / thought of before'). those are both common themes, which i have received both separately and together"

        "answer": "the objective was to explore the dank 3D space in any way i can, without being sucked into the vortex of spending 500 years in the project. 500 to 1000 years is probably the natural amount to be stuck in a 3D project, in order to reasonably explore at least all the basic options for the material. And that's probably many times longer than my entire life span, so clearly some drastic drastic measures need to be taken, urgently, constantly, in order to taper that down to not only something that fits within 1 lifetime, but several times during 1 lifetime (i'm a multi-video kinda guy). So, ...... you grab some cubes, grab some chairs, stack them up, throw some lights, move the camera, .... and even just 1 of those things individually would be enough send you into a 25-year wormhole. so a \"shut up and go\" strategy has to be rapidly and rigorously invoked, again and again and again"

There's still more work I want to do, lots of the songs feel unfinished, and for the ones that feel finished I have more work I want to do on them (like better mixing etc). Im scared to make a social media account or a place where I can upload my songs, because what will probably happen is no one will care about it, then I'll be embarrassed for having this music project rot on the internet. Also I'm scared that if I upload something, I'll feel the pressure to keep uploading, and that pressure might kill the fun of it and I won't want to make songs anymore. maybe I shouldn't post online at all if I enjoy making songs on my own? I admire how your music is so carefree and you post it all online for everyone to see, but there must have been a moment when you posted your first ever song online, was that hard to do? usually it's a package deal for me. posting 1 item online is almost unbearable. what i truly want is to post an ongoing series of many items. most of the time, if i've posted 1 item, it means i've fully convinced myself that it is just 1 of a series of many"

        "question": "What is the universe? Is it an object in another, larger existence? If it isn't, and the universe is all that is and everything that exists is inside it, what IS it? It has a boundary, we know (roughly) how big it is, and that it's expanding. WHAT IS IT EXPANDING INTO? I read All Tomorrows a few hours ago and I'm having an existential crisis. Does it bother you that we will never know the answer to these questions, that the answer likely doesn't exist in this universe and that there are some things we will never know and that it is literally impossible to know? Also how do I get my inspiration back to start making mediocre but somewhat original tracks in FL Studio/Ableton again",
        "answer": "the word 'universe' is pretty much meant to mean the entire world you are living in, expanded out to the farthest extent possible if so, then you'd have to switch what you're calling 'universe' and start calling that larger thing the universe. Or you could just keep chasing new names, each time claiming that the new name really means the whole thing in that case, it would be everything i think it's a decent logical assumption to assume that it has no size (infinite), but i don't really think anyone can prove that. and you certainly can't see or measure all of it. the amount of it which we can see has been measured. but that's not the size of the whole universe, that's just the size we can see, which is known as the 'observable' universe. right now pretty much no one can see further, but that's not a 'space' boundary, it's actually more of a time boundary. looking that far a way looks back in time, and for some reason there is actually a problem with looking back more than 13.8 bil years.... something gets weird and there's like a desktop background of some sort there is an expanding sensation happening. but it's not clear how to define or explain that. everything seems to be getting further away from each other. but then again, the earth feels like it's accelerating up under us, but that would be backwards for the other side of the planet,... and it's not. So there is clearly something relativistic going on in both cases that is possibly a next level of whacky that no one has quite nailed down yet. but these things always get found and learned eventually. even the weird ones that's what it used to feel like for a lot of things that are now known see what else there is to be inspired by. then you can go back"

        "question": "Hey, I know this might a long shot but I'm wondering if you would be willing to answer a couple questions for a school English project I'm doing? I'm a big fan of your music and from reading your answers here and watching the reality videos, I feel like you might have some insightful things to say on this topic. Essentially I'm writing an essay comparing digital music production to a \"selfie\": they are both ways of capturing a moment in time, who you were as well as the world around you, then sharing it with people around the world through the internet. I was wondering if you could share some of your own experience with this so that I could include it in my writing? I have a couple questions: 1. Could you explain how your experiences and personality at the time shaped the music you create, and how did your music change over time as you changed a person? 2. Do you think self-expression through music has changed at all with the advent of online music sharing, compared to before the internet, and if so how? 3. In many ways, the music you create is an extension of yourself. Is it tough to put your music out there and be vulnerable in front of a wide audience which can now comment and give (potentially negative) feedback easily and quickly?",
        "answer": "as i get more experience, i can get better, but then that makes me get more attached to how good i think it's going, and then i get more afraid to take risks, so that creates a temporary problem. then i get desperate and snap and take more risks and it gets good again. this cycle repeats on all variations of timescales, long and short. even within 1 day i was going to say yes but now that i think about it no the only thing more scary than doing it is not doing it"

        "question": "Hi William. I've been working for the last 5 years of my life in a concept album (much like how Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" was an album, but also it was more than just that. It was a movie, and a live show, and a compendium of ideas paired with music and visuals). But now, as I find myself at the last stretch of the process, I can't help but feel guilt at how long this all took. I wish a could have done this faster, but maybe it was just the way that it needed to be made. I'm currently having severe panic attacks thinking that maybe this project didn't turn out to be that good and I just wasted the past 5 years of my life. Any thoughts on this? I was thinking that maybe you felt this way when you were at the last stretch of making \"History of Japan\" or \"History of the entire world, i guess\". If that's the case; How did you dealt with that feeling? How can I push through this last stretch of the process and finally finish the thing without failing? Thanks Bill.",

If it's not too much trouble, could you please explain what's going on there? (So far, here's what I've got: - I think I've worked out that \"won't be late / Oh and I\" is a bar of 7/4 and then back into 4 on \"can't be saved\" - No idea what's going on from the final \"I wanna go outside\" of the first chorus into \"A spaceship\" - \"I'm gonna change my name / Oh it's a brand new day\" is just 4/4, that's pretty straightforward [although it does that funny thing of sounding like a weird time signature because you're expecting it to be weird and it's not, which I love :)] - Oh this isn't a chorus but there's also something I don't understand from \"away from the lines / And I'm outside\" to \"I just opened up\" [The note/fill right before the verse is a good cue for coming in on time, but I don't understand how it gets there in the first place lol] - \"change my ways / Oh and I'm\" is a bar of 7 again, but this time I'm not certain it's back to 4 on \"leaving.\" [Actually wait, I think it is, it's just that the little triplet-sounding keyboard melody and the bass slide both happen on beats that I don't understand?] That's all. Big big thanks in advance if you are able to answer this <3)",
        "answer": "they're probably all different, if i remember correctly right. i might prefer to use 4, then 3, then 4, then 4. just to keep the bar lengths under 4 seconds most of this instrumental fill is completely ignoring the time. but the time clicks steady through this, in 4/4. i can promise you that the chord with the ding on the left is on the \"& of 4\" (last 8th note of the bar). and the following 2 rhodes notes (B, F#) are on the \"& of 2\" and the \"& of 3\" right yeah, that whole riff in between completely ignores the time. i guess it wanted to get...... 'outside' all of that stuff in there ignores the time. but it does click through as 2 full bars, after \"plane\" being on the & of 4. there is a percussion click squarely on beat 3 of the second bar to set you up for the chorus"

        "question": "is there a story behind \"i just did a bad thing\"? if so,, what is it?",
        "answer": "i have 2 stories. one is about the way it was selected, and the other story is about the chorus almost being cancelled. For the song selection, i was using my standard song selection technique, which is to go through all my potential songs, and pick the ones i'm most excited about doing, and put them in a list. i came up with about 30 choices. THEN, this is where i made the mistake: i went around that final list a second time, to try to remove the ones i don't really want, and be left with only the best. The problem is, one by one i found reason to eliminate all of them. Maybe some of them felt too similar to a recent song.... maybe some of them felt too slow... maybe some of them felt too fast.... maybe some were too happy... maybe some of them felt like they would be too boring.... maybe some of them felt like they would be too crazy.... But i eliminated every single one. This is not what's supposed to happen. this is a fear driven situation i found myself in. Really, the important thing to remember when doing the song selection, is that truly any choice can work. Because most of the writing is still ahead, and the entire production is still ahead, and any song, if it's made it to that first list, it has more than good enonugh potential to be turned into something great. But here i was, being so particular that i had actually removed every song from the list. So, in a fit of rage, i un-removed all of them, and very quickly chose one that seemed like the weakest one, which was only 1 line at the time (\"just did a bad thing\"). Not knowing anything else about that song, which way it could go, not knowing what the 'bad thing' is, ... but it seemed to relate to the situation at hand, and i knew the antidote to this conundrum would be to choose something on a whim that was mostly unknown, just like this one. so that's why i made that choice. then i continued the writing from there, using my standard songwriting procedures and practices. The story behind the first chorus (the \"game\" section), is this: When i first launched into that section (coming up with half or maybe all of it), i was excited to have something like this, but then after a few more play-throughs i started to feel like that section really doesn't belong in this song. So i actually filed that away as a different song, and tried to continue forward (from 'cancelled') to see what else i can do instead. What else i found wasn't any better, so i eventually had to decide that the \"game\" section is the best option"

        "question": "do you ever make a realization so fundamental that you wonder how you went all those years without seeing something so obvious in retrospect, it completely changes how you see everything in the world and you know you can never go back to the way you used to think, and you just want to walk into the city on a quiet night and scream \"how can you all not realize the thing I've just realized?\", but you know they'd just think you're crazy?",

And how do I get my motivation back and prevent this from happening in the future?",
        "answer": "you'll have to figure out whether or not you want to write it. if you didn't want to, you wouldn't worry about not doing it. if you did want to, you'd be doing it. somehow you are caught in the middle, which is understandable, but to solve it you just have to go back and ponder the original question of whether you want to do the thing. Actually that brings up another important question, which is what actually is the thing"

        "answer": "the 'attack' knob controls how quick the note starts. Quick attack means the note plays immediately when you press the key. Slow attack means the note takes a long time to fade in. the 'decay' knob controls how quick the note fades away while you're holding the note. Quick decay means the note will disappear almost immediately after you press it, even if you hold the note down. only short notes allowed. dinks and donks. Long decay (or infinite) means the note will stay on as long as you hold the note. 'release' is what happens when you let go of the note. Quick release means the note will stop as soon as you let go of the note. Slow release means the note will ring out for a long time after you let go (like a ringing bell). 'cutoff', also called 'filter cutoff' is like a wawa pedal, if you've ever heard one of those. try saying \"wawawawa\"... this is probably what it would sound like if you hold a note and move the cutoff knob up and down. Turn the knob up and the sound gets more 'aaaa'. turn the knob down and the sound goes more 'ooo'"

        "question": "I know you often say it's best to write the music and the lyrics at the same time. but what should I do if I have a pretty good idea of what the melody and so on should be, but I just can't think of the what words to go with it? like I know what I want to *say* (like the actual emotions and ideas that I want to express), I just can't think of any words that fit. the emotions and thoughts are all slippery and blobby and I can't get them into any actual specific words without them all disappearing and blobbing together again somewhere else. and I know that music can help with that (words alone can say some things but not others, music alone can say some things but others, so if you put them together you can say more things together than you could with either thing alone, right?) but I still can't work out what actual words I should put into this thing, it's so annoying. but anyway you are I think good at having words that go well with music in a wa y that is more than the sum of its parts, so do you know any magic secret advice? or even just any idea what to do here? or am I thinking about this all wrong",
        "answer": "you are thinking about it right. but actually, the problem here is that these things usually only get solved when you're not thinking about it. Which is almost impossible, because you really want this, so you're obviously gonna think about it. but just trust that it will happen. Paraphrasing what you feel it should say, that's good, and you're already doing that. Sometimes it's good to just start trying things, and get all the way through the lines. Sometimes if you're searching for the right thing, you never let yourself finish any lines, because you think it's not right. Start trying complete lines, that actually make it all the way to the end of the line, with words. Finish the line anyway, even if you don't think it's right. and then try different entire lines. Don't be afraid to bend the rhythm to fit the words you're using, if it helps you get to the end of the lines. Also another way to make things come alive is by jolting it into a slightly 'wrong' way. Then again, there might actually be a 'perfect' unjolted right way that you've been wishing for, but that will probably only come to you when you completely stop trying, like in a dream or something. which you can't really plan for"

Or, maybe it was even something you SAW that you associated with jazz. Maybe it's certain people you know whom you associate with 'jazz'. either way, the first step here is to identify jazz, and also figure out what made you start aspiring to it.

Or do you find yourself wanting to get from \"here to there\" melodically or emotively and needing to take some time to figure out the math / theory / voice leading, etc to get it to work? Does that take time the way say, architecture does? Or are you able to just channel that stuff improvisationally? By the way, hearing something as mind bogglingly advanced and yet insanely catchy and melodically accessible as what you create makes me as a musician NOT feel the typical \"I should give up in frustration\" it just makes me love that I can \"get\" it at all beyond a casual listener, while loving it at face value as great music to listen to, and that you are out there making stuff to aspire to...",

        "question": "Hi, I just wanted to say that I am really happy I found out about you and your music. Given everything I've learned about you, you seem to be attempting to convey a special perspective/attitude about things to the world, a perspective that is very important to you because of its sincerity, optimism, power, and profound inspiration. I have not seen many people, if at all, with quite the goal you have, before I found out about you. And that is extremely inspiring and validating to me, because I had often felt like I was the only one who had this special, sincere, optimistic, powerful perspective on things, and who wanted to share this perspective with the world to make the world more open and joyous. I have, like you, found it extraordinary difficult, in fact impossible, to find people who I actually connect with, and I seriously believe it's because nobody quite has the perspective I do on things. Just wanted to tell you about how I think there are people li ke you out there. If my perspective/attitude about things is the same as yours, which I feel like it essentially is, then you can rest assured that there are other people helping share this perspective with everyone. I appreciate the fact that you exist and you are also helping lift up the world this way. That being said, are there some things you learned that you wished you knew when attempting to convey this....thing.....to everyone?",
        "answer": "holy smokes you are very friendly if i learned it, then hopefully it means i do know it. and hopefully i am able to remember it during the conveying process"

Or, maybe you've been studying and learning music, in a musical education process. In that case, music will remind you of education........ however, education can be therapy also. so yes music can be therapy, but it might be a different kind therapy if you're someone that happens to have any sort of logistical relationship(s) with music"

I can usually get through the writing of a song in about 1 to 3 days. it's unpredictable because mechanism revolves around imagining new things out of nowhere. there's unfortunately no guaranteed service counter you can go and pick up the next part. you kind of have to just sit around and pray. and the more you can trick yourself into not trying, the better it will go. the most valuable thing you can do to coax the next part into existence is do a clean run through from the beginning, after not hearing it for a while"

        "question": "recently almost every chorus/prechorus idea i've been excited about has had a 4 chord under the first bar of it. |4|1|5|6m 5|, |4|6m|5|2m 1|, |4|5|3m|6m|, |4|5|6m|1|, |4|6m|3m|3m|, etc. (i come up with the melody before or at the same time as the chords, so i'm not doing anything chords-first.) i think what appeals to me is that it feels like you're near the base of a mountain, looking up at the top of the mountain. it gives you an itch to climb the mountain. being on the 4 is like having unfinished business, so it's automatic dramatic tension for the rest of the hook to resolve. even in something like a |6m|4|1|5|, i feel like the 6m is forlorn and the 4 is what injects hope into it (noticing the top of the mountain). the downside is i feel it's making my ideas sound too similar. like i'm making different versions of the same song each time. i would still like to make something you can dance and sing along to, and still have that dramatic tension , but what is another good way to do it without starting on the 4? do i just need to wait for my taste in melodies to change?",
        "answer": "right rearrange the whole situation. change something even more drastic so you never have to be in that situation. Also it sounds like it's probably time for you to launch into an in-depth study of every popular song you can think of. you'll hear a lot of 4 based things, but you'll also find some other crucial things"

I have made tons of attempted songs, and there are people who say that they enjoy listening to them, but I still personally struggle with the idea that nothing I make is good. The little details like the tone of my voice, uneven piano playing, and overall quality issues suppress my music making constantly. People say that I shouldn't worry about it and that I am a perfectionist, but I don't feel like I can release or share anything I make the the world without knowing personally that it is of a proper level of quality, and none of the songs I have made have reached that insurmountable goal I've set myself. My question is, what should I do? Is there something else I can try to improve my opinion of my music, or should I just keep trying to make something that I think is good, and that I know I will never make.",

Do you know this book before? How long or when did you write\"at the corner store? Is there a way to save the planet in the future because of our advanced technology? You next song is not about boats right? If there's a furniture that you own in your house, what is the furniture you dont need? (Also can i have it please?)",
        "answer": "after reading through them, none of them seem random at all no the first 4 bars of melody are from october 18, 2021, and the TEMP lyric i had was \"at the corner store, getting things you need for the brand new world\". promising myself that that would NOT be what the song is about. the rest of the song was written on april 3-4, 2022 yes the identity of the next song is completely unknown. the only things i know, almost for certain, are: it will not be about retail/stores it will not be in the key of B broken AC sure"

        "question": "any significance to ending Corner Store on a bm7 chord other than the \"store\" closing? It's one of the only songs I can think of that spends so much time in (B) major and then ends on the minor. Awesome work thanks for being a constant source of inspiration.",
        "answer": "at the end, you have to consider the B minor in the key of A. so it's like ending on the 2 minor (not 1). The fact that it's the same root as the key of the verse is a coincidence. If i could try to understand why it had to be a 2 there, well, the other choruses use 4 there instead. in those previous choruses, the 4 was a brand new chord. In the final chorus, however, the 4s are blasting strong at the top of each line. so to achieve the same 'new' effect, you'd want to swap the 4 for 2. and when you consider it's the final 'closing' of the store and song, it becomes a no brainer to hunker down on the 2 there. i'm just trying to explain now after the fact, why it happened that way. it reminds me of the ending of \"got to know what's going on\""

        "question": "So in one song the lyrics go \"Wednesday feels so long ago. I said it three or four songs ago.\" But going through the catalog of songs 3 or 4 prior to that one I don't hear any references to anything like that. So I was just wondering if it was actually a reference to a previous song or just a series of words that sounded cool together so there they were?",
        "answer": "it's a combination of very true sentiments. to quote the relevant parts, it's \"hello, it's a tuesday show\"..... \"i said it 3 or 4 songs ago, IT'S TIME FOR THE SHOW\". For a long time now i've expressed intense desire to have a very regular (preferably weekly) release of new material, such as songs/videos. I decided somewhere along the line that i gravitate toward Tuesday as the preferred release date, if and when such a release schedule could be achieved. \"said it 3 or 4 songs ago\" is quite an understatement actually...... i say it all the time. Not necessarily in songs, but i express this desire constantly, and perhaps i was just using 'songs' as a way to measure time. Like if you are measuring time in Jeopardy episodes, you might say it was 3 or 4 Jeopardys ago, even if the event did not actually occur on Jeopardy. Nonetheless, it wasn't just 3 or 4 songs ago, it seems like a constant desire for the past many years. Anyone who knows me is well aware of my obsession with achieving this kind of regular release schedule, and i've certainly talked about it here. In addition, when it says \"it's time for the show\", i do recall using that line in an improv at some point, which is posted on this site. So in a way, the line is also a reference to that improv. Which itself is probably yet another reference to my ongoing desire to present a regularly scheduled show of content. ALSO, i probably had in mind that i've used the word \"Wednesday\" prominently in a song, released in 2015. That's more than 3 or 4 songs ago, but in that sense it would be a hyperbolic estimate. and i'd say that reference is probably only secondary to the reference to the desire for a regular release schedule. Also, to boot, i admit i was thinking the phrase also sounded cool, while also having several different angles of metaphoric truth for me"

        "answer": "absolutely not both is by far most common, but to be honest now that i re-read your question it doesn't make very much sense to me. if you only have instrumentals and lyrics, you'll still be missing a lot.... like the whole melody (pitches) being sung for the lyrics. in any case, the lyric+melody+chords are all dependent on each other so for best results they will all come into existence simultaneously"

        "question": "What's the breakdown for how much of new canaan was written prior to the trip, en route to new canaan, in new canaan, on the return trip home, and at home after the trip?",
        "answer": "none of it was written before the trip. during the trip, (may 15, 2009) this entire version was written (page 1 and page 2). the part about harlem was written while the train was stopped at the 125 street stop (harlem). that's where the idea came from. By the time i got to new canaan i feel like i had likely made it to at least the end of the chorus ('every word i say is true'). Some of the next parts were written at the outdoor tables at starbucks, just next to the train station in new canaan. i took a brief walk for a few blocks and may have worked on the last chorus (grey) while waiting for the train and/or on the way back. On nov 6, 2012, i made some clarifications to the melody and chords. Decided on the key of D. Did some re-writes, such as \"12 figure\" instead of 7 figure, and i also came up with the 'license plates' line to replace the line that was there before. The entire starbucks stanza was re-written to be stronger. Also re-wrote the last chorus to be stronger. on august 9, 2013 some small melody/chord details were clarified/adjusted"

        "answer": "i had just thrust myself into a brand new schedule, so i knew i would be extremely tight on time for all parts of the process. i took a walk to try to relax and prepare for the insanity, and i allowed my mind to casually try to recall from memory if there are any songs which might stand out as good choices. 'special sandals' (which was only 8 bars at the time) seemed to cross my mind, because it's one that i'd been fond of for the past couple years since writing. it's one of the ones that keeps persistently popping into my head, in general. so i thought of that one. Normally i would have probably rejected that one on the basis of 'sandals' being too iffy and weird and possibly not strong. Or the fact that it was only 8 bars and i might have preferred to pick something that was a little further along. However, this being a brand new schedule, it seemed like the perfect sort of carefree vibe to pick that one. Of course, being who i am, i had to insist on going through the list properly, so i did. it looks like i came up with 10 finalists, including special sandals. it turns out, sandals was still feeling favored, and got extra points for having visited me earlier on the walk"

        "question": "You have said that you won't make an album because that is not how you yourself enjoy music. You listen to singles only.Is this true? What do you think about albums that are greater than the sum of their parts, and are crafted to be enjoyed in sequence? I think this is what people mean when they ask if you'll make an album, they (I) want the artist to curate a longer-form listening experience. Previously you've said your songs should be listened to in release order, but with the knowledge of how you select your next songs it seems like the chronologic album is like a psedo-shuffle mode, and infact each subsequnet song you try to subvert the last for the sake of not repeating yourself.",
        "answer": "i listen to songs, sometimes in large quantities, but not arranged in the order of the original album i've heard of those. i was curious about them, so i listened to some of the most famous reknown ones, that are commonly most hailed and respected for being exactly what you just said. in every case, i was not only surprised to find out that they did NOT sound/feel to me like anything more than a list of songs, but ALSO in every case i was shocked to find out that the songs didn't even sound like they were in a very good order. yes, my preferred way to do that is to combine it with video, and use music in ways much beyond just songs they can be listened to in any order that sounds good for sequencing, but you still don't have to listen to it that way if you don't like it that way"

Also you're gonna want to make sure you have a sound that has infinite sustain while you're holding it. (does not decay) (set the 'decay' to zero). that way you can hold it and wawa it forever and it won't go away. also there's no echo on the chords. the delay is on the lead"

        "answer": "yes, some of the more emotionally charged (and usually high) melodies in there are pretty 'drifty'. and probably impossible to notate accurately some of the melodies are not notatable, but the official writing is done using audio recordings. so i deliver it as precisely as i can on an audio memo file and then use that as reference for how it is supposed to go"

        "question": "If songs are written when you're not thinking, how can I create a system wherein I can not think about 1 specific song at a time long enough for it to eventually be fully written? It seems like I would have to use a fair bit of thought just to keep a song of my choice on the chopping block",
        "answer": "the best way i know is to \"reset\" your mind and then do a run-through of what you have so far, in real time. The fresher you are, the more likely you will clearly see the song for what it is, and get something. The best way to achieve this sort of 'reset' of 'freshness', unfortunately, is to go for a long period of time without hearing the song, and then hear a real-time run through for the first time. Then as soon as you hit the end of that run through, that's when the next part is most likely to hit you. And if it doesn't, ......... well, the best thing to do is reset again and try again. However, the problem is that the best resets take way too much time to do. So if you actually want to get it done, you need a force-reset, and what i typically do is walk over and touch the door handle and come back (then start the run-through). That works a little bit, but not always. What i've discovered recently might be much more effective is to go to the shower and put your face under the cold water. This seems to work shockingly well, and for the past 2 weeks i've been using it repeatedly on everything from writing to music arrangement to video production. it might be the most effective instant-reset method i've ever found. I keep expecting it to wear out but it seems to keep working"

        "answer": "just started pedaling a Bb bass note at a certain tempo, and then the melody/chord riff came, like this (from october 18, 2021). then the next time i looked at it, i think i had sort of a dummy lyric which seemed to fit, like this (from october 20, 2021). and at that time i also acknowledged that \"when i close my eyes\" also seems might be another option for a later verse somewhere. I was quite certain that i did NOT want the \"corner store\" to be the primary lyric. i suspected that a second verse might say \"at the corner store, getting things you need for the brand new world\" or something. Then for the production cycle due on 4/19/22, this song was selected, purely based on the musical riff, and again with the caveat that the \"corner store\" will NOT be the primary lyric, nor the title. The first several hours of the songwriting session were promptly spent trying vehemently to come up with something 'better' than the corner store line. vague themes of morning/awakening were floating around, some sort of idea of some kind of congregation or club, feelings of renewal, ..... these were the vibes i was going for, but i never came up with anything that fit.

        "question": "The \"when, where, were, we're\" segment of \"if the world doesn't end\" is one of my favorite moments you've ever written, both lyrically and musically. It sounds great and gives me the feeling of an epiphany when I hear it. How did that come about? And why \"when\"? Why not \"why\" or \"what\"? Something about the sound of \"when\"?",
        "answer": "if i could try to psychoanalyze what might have happened here, i'd say the line starts \"here you are, there we were\", so i think after saying 2 W words in a row, i think that sets a train in motion where you wanna keep going. And the previous 2 phrases started with \"here\" and \"there\", ... so you wanna say \"where\", and also \"when\", and of course \"where\" is naturally followed by \"were\", and then \"were\" easily transforms to \"we're\", and of course everyone loves a fun apostrophe game, and then now you're set up for an echo of the same line in the previous verse in that place (around again), and also fits with the point of the song (the world not ending). This is just my analysis of the line after the fact. when writing it, i'm pretty sure everything from \"when\" to the end of the line came immediately. Oh right, you were asking why it's not \"why\" or \"what\" instead of \"when\"... and the best thing i can suggest is, try imagining it with those other 2 choices... in my opinion i think that sounds much worse"

If i don't get anything, then i refresh again and do a another run through. If i do it several times and still don't get the next part, then i'm considered \"stuck\". in that case, i might do some discussion about what is going on-- and i try to categorically hone in on what might be the right answer. usually what i really need when i'm stuck is a stronger refresh. the best way to do that is to take some time away from it, but if i don't have time for that, sometimes running cold water on my face can work surprisingly well. and then do the run through, and it feels fresh again, and i'd be more likely to hear the next part"

        "answer": "if you have notes C, Eb, and G together, and especially if there is also a C note in a fairly low range, that is probably considered a C minor chord. The same thing could be said about G minor, with notes G, Bb, and D, with G in the bass. and so on, with any groups of notes in this same relative orientation to each other if you have notes C, E, and G together, and especially if there is also a C note in a fairly low range, that is probably considered a C major chord. The same thing could be said about G major, with notes G, B, and D, with G in the bass. and so on, with any groups of notes in this same relative orientation to each other there is an attempt to describe a chord, using small combinations of letters and numbers for example, if you have a C major chord (with notes C, E, and G) and you swap out the E note for F instead (C, F, G), this new chord would often be considered Csus4. If you swap the note for D instead (C, D, G), it might be considered Csus2. If there is no number in the chord symbol and it just says Csus, it would almost definitely be assumed to be Csus4. but if you're a person who uses both sus2 and sus4 frequently, it's probably good to specify the number"

        "answer": "\"scared of my own face\", i assume, is Csus2/E Dsus4/F# \"yes i do is that true\" would be some kind of Dmin9(11), then some kind of Gmin11. You can probably pretty closely approximate these by using Cadd4/D, and Bbsus2/G \"it's a bad and good tune and i would sing it to you\".... \"bad and\" is generally Dmin11 and Dmin7. \"Good tune\" is roughly Cmaj and Bbmaj triads, and the bass is in the middle of a climb which would put it on F and G at that time, making the chords you hear something like C/F and Gmin7. \"And I\" would be something like Gmin11, but because the bass is midway through a climb, in reality what you hear is probably something like Bbsus2/A. \"would sing\" would just be Bbsus2, and \"it\" the melody goes to A note, so i'd say this would sound like F/Bb, except this syllable is such a ghost that there's really not much of anything there. and \"to you\" comes out as F/C, C \"Things that i\" should be some kind of F#min7. \"Love\" should be something like Dmin/F. \"be scared of\" is some kind of Bmin9(11), which can be more specifically described as Aadd4 over B. The bass tumbles into this, so the bass doesn't reach the bottom until around \"of\""

        "question": "So I'm trying to make instrumental music with new techniques - instead of programming all of it I combine programming with physical equipment (drum machine & synthesizer), having a more loose collective of styles rather than being more stylistically focused, making generally longer songs, practicing buildups, possibly adding in vocals/lyrics, etc. But it's been really frustrating because I've gotten so good at the much more creatively limited methods I used before, and it feels like I'm back to square one to a degree. I tried going back to old methods and it's going great. I'm getting way more music done than I have been in months. But it feels *too* easy, if that makes sense. Like I could come up with a lot more creative and imaginative stuff if I wasn't just hypnotically pumping out the same stuff I'd always done. I guess my question is, is it possible for creative projects to be *too* easy to make? How do I know when I've hit that creative hotspot to make truly great art?",

Anyway, I am writing because I realized there is something wrong with me. I was talking to a friend about when we used to be super busy. I asked her how she was not miserable when she was overloaded not only with school and extracurriculars, but also heavy work shifts. She said \"I wasn't miserable. I was happy.\" Which made me realize how much I am not like that. I was miserable with half the schedule she had, and I continue to dread any amount of work that comes my way no matter how minuscule or easy. Except for I think I have a slightly smaller aversion when it comes to practicing music, though perhaps I would start to hate it if I pursued it as a serious education/career path. So basically what I am saying to you is: is there something wrong with me, should I look/wait for something I enjoy doing or should I just force myself to stick with something, and do you have any advice.",

So the first thing on the writing session was to try to find anything alse besides the store, to put on that riff. but nothing else fit as well as the corner store. i relented and made it about the store."

        "question": "So in the new video, it kinda seems like the main character is learning more about his gamerness just from explaining it to the other person? Like he says \"I just noticed\" several times, and goes from being sort of flip floppy between \"some of the time\" and \"most of the time\" near the beginning to confidently correcting his new friend that its \"most of the time\" at the end. Is that what the receptionist was getting at when they said to go down the hall to find \"proof of self\"? Also btw the song is incredible, I love how it starts off as a cool bop and then around \"in the real game\" it starts to gradually branch off and gets unexpectedly kinda beautiful and magic sounding, then goes straight back into being all head-boppy at the end.",

        "question": "I've been trying to get to know music better through actual songs like you advise, but I've been having trouble. I can hear the main melody and what the bass is playing, and by being able to hear the tonic/key it's in, I can play the melody and bassline quite easily on the piano after and transpose to any other key, but I don't know how to hear all the notes that the guitar and piano/keyboard are playing. Most of the time, I can barely even hear them over the drums/percussion. Even in solo piano/guitar arrangements though, it's very difficult to hear the notes other than the melody and bass. Should I be trying to hear each individual note and then put it together one by one to make find out the chord, hear the chord all at once, or something else entirely?",
        "answer": "to start, yes, you can just brute force listen to each note one by one. This may seem brutal at first, but just remember: chords are just as hearable as words. when you get used to it, you'll be able to hear a song in a crowded store and you'll know what the chords are. Even if you literally can't hear the chords, you'll hear them because you'll know what they are based on the context. same as you can understand a person in a crowded room even if you don't hear every word. So just be aware that that skill is waiting for you. But yes, you may have to start out with brute force note by note. Another thing you can do is, find some songbooks that you trust. And then find recordings you trust, of those songs. This can be another way to familiarize yourself with things. but if you stick with it, i'd say it's only a matter of time before you can actually predict upcoming chords of songs you've never heard. just like you might be able to predict almost exactly what words i"

Or do you think that 3/4 and 6/8 each have a unique enough feel that a 3/4 song would still feel like 3/4 even if you bump the tempo way up, and a 6/8 song would still feel like 6/8 even if you drop the tempo way down?",
        "answer": "sure. people get 3 (or 6) feels mixed up all the time. one of the hazards of putting out a song with any kind of meter divisible by 3, is that some people are gonna always hear it the wrong way from what you meant. this pretty much doesn't happen with 4, because there's only 1 prime factor i guess is what it boils down to people may even disagree about what to put on the page. i see \"3/4\" written all the time when the quarter note is at many hundreds of bpms. on the other hand, often i'd see 4/4 in the same situation, using triplets and then the quarter note bpm would be extremely slow. for that, i usually prefer to compromise and write it in 6, to adhere to a good size bar length. i generally try to keep the bars as close to 3 seconds as i can, to avoid feeling disoriented"

        "question": "What is full note? What is half note? Quarter note? How do chord progressions work? Whats a minor chord? How about major chord? Thanks if you answered anything here billl!",
        "answer": "never heard of it, but from context clues it might be a whole note that's a musical note that lasts for 2 beats (if the beats are being counted normally) that's a musical note that lasts for 1 beat (if the beats are being counted normally) some people say chord 'progressions' because the word 'progression' is a very large word and it stalls for time. but, chords are when you play multiple notes at the exact same time on different pitches together. it has a magic quality kind of like color. you could spend a thousand lifetimes trying to explain just how or why it works, and a thousand more lifetimes just fancying up new ways to use them if you have notes C, Eb, and G together, and especially if there is also a C note in a fairly low range, that is probably considered a C minor chord. The same thing could be said about G minor, with notes G, Bb, and D, with G in the bass. and so on, with any groups of notes in this same relative orientation to each other if you have notes C, E, and G together, and especially if there is also a C note in a fairly low range, that is probably considered a C major chord. The same thing could be said about G major, with notes G, B, and D, with G in the bass. and so on, with any groups of notes in this same relative orientation to each other"

Like I could look at an elephant's tail through a tube and describe what I saw and someone else could look at the same elephant but be looking at the ear and describe the elephant totally differently. And so then I feel badly for even talking about what I see because I know I can't see the whole picture, but I also can only describe what I can see. And so I feel like a liar no matter how truthful I try to be. And so then I don't want to say anything. But I'm also just so infinitely curious about the elephant and the only way any of us are gonna piece it together is by sharing the parts we can see and believing in each other. But it's so hard sometimes. Does running this questions page give you a sense of centeredness when you realize everyone is as adrift as everyone else? Doe s it give you a sense of hopefulness when you witness so much curiosity?",

        "answer": "go through about 50 of your favorite songs, and identify each chord with brute force. quickly unpause/pause (or nowadays you can edit to loop a tiny fraction of audio very quickly) and just pick it out note by note and put it together. write down all the chords to a song (in time, with bar lines, etc.)..... once you do this for about 30 or 40 songs, i think you will find that you don't have to search for the individual notes anymore. ... maybe not even pause it at all. After about 100 more songs, you probably won't even have to listen to the song, you will be able to do it from memory. after about 1000 songs, you will probably be able to hear someone singing the melody for a song you have never heard before, without hearing the chords, and figure out what the chords should be. after 10,000 songs, you should be able to play chords along with them on the first try, never having heard the song before, and have them think you already knew the song"

        "answer": "it's the same way to know what happens next in a song. which i also don't know. at any time, when coming up with the next part of the song, ending it should always be one of the options. even at the beginning yes, but that hopefully shouldn't affect how the song is written no. padding is boring, i assume"

Or, between the note C# and the nearest G. or any two notes 3 whole steps apart. \"tri-tone substitution\" would be like let's say if you have a normal song in the key of C, and you have that D7 chord, which famously contains the notes F# and C in the chord. If you lie around thinking about music for long enough you'll notice that you can play the F# and C notes in the chord, with the D bass note, and that gives you the D7 chord, but you can also put the bass on Ab instead and that gives you an Ab7 chord just the same. So a \"tri-tone substitution\" is when you use Ab7 instead of D7. (or A7 instead of Eb7. or Bb7 instead of E7. and so on). seems crazy but it just might work"

        "question": "Is there a story behind More Than A Dream? Its one of my favorites of yours",
        "answer": "yes the verse melody came to me in a dream (about a year earlier). but when i chose that one for the next song (later) i decided to \"do it right\" ............. it was written while cruising around google streetview. almost as if written while driving. i made no deadline and was not demanding myself to get the answers particularly quickly. in retrospect this might have been a mistake. when it came to the recording process, i also was transitioning to different software which would allow me to do my own computer programming to get more of the functioning i want. also a massive rabbit hole. when the song (audio) was finally completed, my mind was already racing with potential strategies to transform everything so i never take too long ever again. i was fantasizing about the ancient old days where people used to use 4-track machines. i was fantasizing about the old days when people used to be able to record an entire album in a day. i was obsessed with the idea of putting insanely simple limitation rules on the process, in the future. for the video i experimented with a \"2 day or reset\" strategy, where i'm forced to abandon the work if the video is not completed in 2 days. there were reasons why i thought this would be better than a simple deadline strategy. this evolved into a section-by-section \"1 hour or reset\" strategy. it was thrilling in some ways, but ridiculously exhausting in other ways. i ended up giving up on that strategy, but i still ended up finding inspiration for quickness by looking back to some of the files for \"best friends with my own front door\", to try to observe and analyze how quickly i was actually making the moves, in the video production. this inspired me to get into some quickness. in any case, the video was completed very quickly after i'd been stuck in the song production forever"

        "answer": "i was about to go out for a walk, and then right about when i was putting my shoes on, i came up with a high figure \"(i) don't wanna Die!\" with \"die\" on beat 1 bar 1, all notes being flat 7 except the last note being the high 1, and the rhythm being like \"(&)a e a1\", and i was also working on the selection process right about the same time, and somehow i switched it to \"i'm scared\" which seemed a bit stronger, and the bassline was working its way up and back to 1 over the course of 2 bars (more similar to what it does in 'ground plane'), and it got added to the list. i also had a bridge section which didn't get used, which i think was added to the list separately. i'd preliminarily selected 81 items, including \"i'm scared\", \"ground plane\", \"i'm a huge gamer most of the time\", \"special sandals\", a vamp similar to the 'happy' section of ground plane, and a figure that would become \"at the corner store\". I then i narrowed it down to a list of 16, including \"i'm scared\", \"huge gamer\", the figure that would become \"corner store\", and the vamp that would become \"i'm happy\". Then i asked the computer to choose for me from amongst those 16, and it chose number 10 which was \"i'm scared\". Then i think the first thing i did was i changed it so the bass gets around the line in 1 bar instead of 2, because it seemed to slam harder that way. then i wrote the rest of the song according to my best songwriting procedures and practices"

        "answer": "anywhere, everywhere, that can be done that's also an option. I should mention: it's 2 different activities, starting songs and writing them. i can come up with starting ideas for songs all day and put them into the list, but it's an entirely different activity to take responsibility for finishing one. and i mostly only do that after i know it's been selected to also be the next one to be produced into a recording and video"

        "answer": "i'm not sure what kind of studio you are talking about, but just reading between the lines it sounds like it is a pretty heavy studio with a lot of... stuff in it, stuff which maybe you don't normally have access to. and it sounds like you are getting fearful and confused about your path to production. so for this i recommend immediately turning to a production process which is much simpler. sometimes when i'm feeling overwhelmed i dig deep somewhere into the past and find a some live video of a guy in the 1970s performing a song with a guitar and his voice, on stage, in real time, in 1 take. just to remind me of how simple it can be to create a song. there are millions of ways to produce music, but from what you described it sounds like you'd be pleased to discover some ways that are much easier, quicker, and readily within reach at any hour of the day. and believe me, those ways exist and they're all around us. and then you can just work your way up from there"

        "question": "A couple weeks or months ago i asked a question because i found that every cool melodic idea i had seemed to go with a chord sequence that starts on the 4 chord. And i asked for advice on replicating the tension that starting on the 4 brings, without starting the chorus in all of my songs on the 4 chord. You suggested i transcribe a bunch of songs that i like to figure out what they're doing. I went through a big playlist i had of my favorite songs, and what i learned is, maybe i just really like songs with choruses that start on the 4? I went through 65 of them and 21 unambiguously had a chorus starting on the 4. Which seems like a lot. Another 15 of them started with a 6m into a 4, mostly going 6m 4 1 5. I don't tend to write a lot of songs with that progression because i wrote about a billion that way when i was younger. So that's over half of the songs (36/65) covered by the two harmonic ideas i am already doing way too much. Of the rest of the songs, wh ile they're good, they generally don't have the immediate tension that songs starting on the 4 do. Maybe it shouldn't be surprising that different chords sound different. But it seems like the best approach is either to deal with all my songs being a bit similar, or to accept that they won't be exciting in the same manner as (for example) Everytime We Touch. Does that seem like a fair assessment",
        "answer": "that's understandable. i do too. a lot of people do yes, my research shows that's the most common sequence of them all it sounds like you might want something to shake things up. find some totally different music. try going through popular music charts from the 2000s. 1990s. 1980s. 1970s. 1960s. 1950s. 1940s. 1930s. 1920s. 1910s. 1900s. 1890s. and so on. you probably won't like all of it, but somewhere in there i'm sure you'll find something that will open up some doors for you also i just realized you should try starting on the 2m chord. see what that does for you. 2m is the shady sister of 4"

        "answer": "that's the best feature of twitter. the 'tweet' feature. this is using the platform as the original creators intended i start throwing ideas around and see what excites me. then if possible i can give it another twist or two, to see if it excites me more. other times it occurs to me unexpectedly when not trying to work on it. i just realized these are all the same things that happen in songwriting thinking carefully will unfortunately not get the job done, so in the cases where it does not come quickly, pretty much you gotta just sit around and play in the dirt somehow until it does come quickly. i just realized these are all the same things that happen in songwriting if you see a note that's identical to a tweet, the date of the note should always be earlier. the notebook page always attempts to reflect the original date the item was written. but often things are composed and then posted to twitter immediately. i am not against this. i could and maybe should do this with songs also, somehow"

        "question": "You mention trying to combine song and scene a lot. Any reason(s) it's such a challenge? Anything that would make it easier to achieve? Is the medium to express it just not right?",
        "answer": "the challenge of merging song and scene is that sometimes the songs just happen in bits. bits that would never work outside the context of the scenes. the challenge is to do it in a way that the song fits perfectly in the scene but ALSO is a playable entity on its own. a song that can survive on its own, without the scene(s). i doubt anyone's gonna want to have \"but then cortez came and smashed it\" on their playlist"

        "question": "just finished a 738 page novel-- one of the hardest in the english language-- i think the author was one of the greatest writers to have ever lived. i have no idea what to do now. in about two weeks i'm gonna be in college again. it is consuming me. i have no idea what to do with this novel in my head now. finishing it should've been this big, life-changing event. i should feel accomplished. many people have tried and given up because it's so hard. i can brag about it. but i feel empty now. i want to write but my head is empty. and all i can write is short stories from the perspective of a suicidal character who i'm not a hundred percent sure isn't just a fictional proxy for myself i want to write but i won't have the time to. it's embarrassing, actually. it's like how have you read Joyce and you're this bad at writing. the standard's right there, in front of you. he wrote the greatest stylistic guide of the 20th century. it's right there. how are you still writing clunky prose and how are you overusing clich\u00e9d phrases and how are you writing such pointless, onanistic, autofellatious, pretentious, angsty-adolescent-male bullshit. mine isn't the story of a secret literary genius stuck in academia struggling to write myway out. i'm just a guy who doesn't want to study, who also happens to be a below-average writer.",
        "answer": "maybe you could write 5 or 10 of those just to get it out of your system and then maybe new ideas will start creeping in i think you may need some reverse psychology to get out of this. have you ever tried writing the 'wrong' story"

THAT'S NOT TRUE. but it still sounds musical. put it in my musical. and the musical music is true. and i'm not really sure how to handle it. don't really know what it is. don't really believe it. can't figure out what it says. it makes me weep, skip, sing it while i sleep, conversate with a stranger at 10x speed, and slow it way way down for the memory. slow it way way way down for the ending. [riff] that's the trumpet. get up and go stare at the flag pole. [riff] i'm not worthy of this course of entertainment and i don't even know who i'd rather be. i'm not listening to the words on the soundtrack cause i keep on getting more confused. and i'm not sure if anything is true. that's not true\""

        "question": "the chorus of a new song seems surprisingly personal for bill wurtz song, in a more obvious way than the way all of your songs are personal. do you actually struggle with feelings like the ones explored in that chorus? fantastic tune by the way",
        "answer": "it's one of the least personal songs i've ever done. i don't know where it came from. The melody, for the verse, however, is extremely personal and i stand by that. never found a lyric that really captures what i honestly am feeling in that melody. the best expression of that line is when it's done instrumentally later. the staring at the flag pole is not quite genuine either, except actually given the circumstance, it is, if you account for the fact that i'm halfway through a song that did not necessarily start well (lyrically), so as i stare at the flag pole in this moment i can let the original melody come back to me, hopefully to catch a glimpse of it slightly closer to its original form it's one of the least personal, but, the subtext is perhaps that i was possibly venting frustration that i never was able to come up with a title-worthy line for the first line melody in this particular song which i wrote 2 weeks ago. being stuck with a mostly un-relatable and disingenuous first line, i had no choice but to lean in harder and continue on writing more parts i don't relate to. however, it all fit into the fun game i've been playing, where i try to write songs as if i was another writer. it hopefully tricks me into coming up with new ideas absolutely not. unless you apply them very abstractly to only that week's song-writing session, and not applied on a life-long scale as it probably sounds in the lyric if taken literally"

Also, the middle section where it goes \"it's not true, it's not true\", that part does seem to be about me. Whether i like to admit it, i've noticed over the years that i just really seem to enjoy saying \"that's not true\". and that's probably the reason this section exists. The other line that's pretty much about me is \"put it in my musical\". Generally, i've come to realize that one of the most promising and useful ways i could express any idea i may have, is to \"put it in a musical\", which can more broadly refer to most of the kind of audio/visual content i've released so far"

        "answer": "keep doing all this and eventually you'll find common ground. like dreams, the ideas want to come to you when you're not trying. that's why you freeze up when you are actually 'supposed to' have an idea. and why the ideas come so easily when it doesn't matter. these 2 opposing worlds (in-the-office, out-of-the-office) will probably always be disconnected like this. but the more you do both, the better you will get at both. for out-of-the-office, i think the game of capturing can always be improved. most of the time you are feeling like you are unable to capture it completely. because, like dreams, the best ideas probably happen when you are entirely not trying, and entirely not thinking nor worried. and as soon as you start worrying about capturing it, that will begin to degrade the idea. but i'd say over time you can just about get the hang of it with minimal degradation. And for the in-the-office experience, there are hopefully some things you can do to settle in and get more comfortable. I'd recommend starting out by playing/writing bad things on purpose, to try to take the pressure off. play at least enough to forget you're there. that should hopefully put you back in the proper carefree state"

        "question": "do you think instrumental music can convey as much (or in some cases more) emotional impact or story to the listener as music with lyrics? i think it's a little sad that most people are aversive to listening to instrumentals by themselves.",
        "answer": "music without words, scenes, or any other context, works mostly on your feelings and emotions, in a way that can be difficult to grasp if there's nothing to hold onto. it's extremely powerful, but it needs something to hold it. words can do this, scenes can do this, almost anything the music is attached to, can help hold the music and put it into context, and activate all of its power. and, at the same time, the music will greatly enhance the power of the thing it's attached to. Think of it like this: music is the beverage. the context/words/scene is the cup. imagine a beverage with no cup. same beverage...... undrinkable. Also, a cup without a beverage can be pretty bland also. Instead of being disappointed about this, i think you'll find it extremely rewarding to become a cupsmith. you'll be doing wonders for all different kinds of music, and cups as well. it's a win-win"

        "question": "Hi i wanted to try and make a sort of breakdown of Fly Around cause I really wanted to see what you'd think of it. Okay anyway here i go wish me luck \"i walk over the earth in special sandals i took those sandals off now i can fly around\" 'Special sandals' may represent something holding you down.. It's description as \"special\" may be found in a less positive light than tonally suggested, or perhaps could be found rather as just a catchy verbally-'adjacent adjective' ..or perhaps entirely as just a magical item betrothed upon our main character that upon removal awakens their inner super-power of flight- I'm not entirely sure and I'd love to hear your thoughts on the line. \"some people wonder why the sun is not very bright\" my arms ar e much too tired for this conversation\" I'll come back to this line momentarily! \"i travel the distance in between where i was and where i would like to be a little later\" I suppose this is a long poetic way of saying I went from here to there (presumably whilst flying, of course) \"the sky is falling\" Okay this gets interesting- in your video \"gonna clean my room\" the song goes that you'll clean your room after the 'sun burns out' and the 'sky falls down' so there's an interesting connection, added on top of that 'sun is not very bright' coincided with 'sun burns out.' And another cool thing- 'sun burns out and the sky falls down' is also pretty similar to the line from 'mount saint helens' - 'sun falls down and the sky burns out.' I suppose in general a lot of your music conveys apocalyptic emotions and references so perhaps 'sun is not ver y bright' and 'the sky is falling' were merely intuition ..but then I thought deeper.. the song as a whole... And I realized given all the present themes of the future being upon us and reconciling that with the memories of our past, maybe all this really does take place farther along upon a vast timeline, where the sun may really be slowly dying out and no longer radiates light to the extent of our own. And all this talk of the sun and skies still connects it all back to 'flying around'. His arms are supposedly too tired to talk about it, maybe from flying, or maybe even because he doesn't want to talk about it. \"the sky is larger than any sky can be\" This builds on 'sky is falling\" describing how unimaginably and unbelievably vast the sky truly is, presumably as seen from the perspective of one flying across it. \"oo, ah, oh, ee my calendar is telling me it's the future\" I remember you talking about this sorta lyrical device in an answer to a question about balancing phrases and musical non-words, and this truly masters that- the punch and impact in this chorus is really felt. \"somewhere there's a second scene with characters that never speak but you still know exactly what they mean and you still know exactly what the story will be\" This 'second scene' musically illustrates a depiction of characters who despite never exchanging any dialogue you still know what they are saying, the way a drawing conveys a story without any words. \"i travel the world without my blanket so when i'm feeling tired i can just... fly around\" This is very tongue-in-cheek contradictory all around yet elicits such powerful feelings and is honestly really musically beautiful. \"most people wonder if the moon is part of the sky or if it's just a decoration added later\" This line retains the themes of out-of-our-world observations of the sun and skies from the previous verses upon titularly flying around. It also retains a merit of scientific accuracy given as you've said in your own words: ''holy sh*t we just got hit with another ball of flaming rocks- and it kind of made a mess. which is \ud83c\udfb6now the moon\ud83c\udfb6.' In essence this line maybe asks the question 'is the moon really real?' And while being musically a melodic 'echo' of 'sun is not very bright' the question simultaneously implies the same feeling the statement 'the sky is larger than any sky ca n be' does. \"oo, ah, oh, ee my galaxy is spinning toward the future\" Continuing to tie in visualizations of beyond-our-world intergalactic wonders, this line ties in both time and space. \"somewhere in the 7th scene when no one understands the point of view that you now find so familiar\" '7th scene' captures the feeling that we've moved on a little bit further into this story's future and also makes for a zesty rhyme with '2nd scene.' But really this line truly speaks for itself- it finds this whole analysis to be ironic. We can't fully understand the point of view that the artist finds so familiar. But that's the beauty of storytelling and songwriting. \"oh my memori es are coming back in ways i wasn't ready for but i'm still enjoying the way it feels\" This line hits right in the feels. Also the 'oh' later transforms into 'oooh' later in the song- I just noticed that. \"so i'm holding onto the details capture this moment in a series of carefully chosen words and phrases and then replay it\" This is an interesting sorta meta realization and description of songwriting, the literal feeling of capturing a feeling.. or a memory ..or a memory being made there and then. \"walk over the earth in special sandals i kick those sandals off and watch them fly around\" Flipp ing and twisting the opening line around and in on itself to expand upon it in a new perspective in a new verse. \"i didn't notice if they ever landed but if they do i'll understand the reason\" Of course alluding to the law of gravity, but also still (purposefully or not) tying in with the other apparent 'scientific' details in this song such as the sun's dwindling illumination and the moon's decorative origins. \"oh, ah, oo, ee the melody is drifting into the future\" The melody literally drifts into the future in spectacular key change faction. The vocal non-words are even rearranged so you really feel that 'oo'! \"and i feel pretty good about what time it is about what day it ever was and how it came to this\" A feeling of content with the past and how we got here, and maybe even a glimpse of hope for the future. \"ooooh\" 'dangmmmmmm..' \"the memory is drifting back in ways that i'll pretend to know and understand and i pretend to know exactly how the story will end\" Myself and I'm sure so many others know this feeling, it's so human to think, feel, and perhaps hope you know what will happen next. This completes the themes of storytelling within this song- from knowing what the story will be to pretending you know how it will end. And that story stretches beyond fiction into our own personal narratives, of the past, present and future. No one else really understands that narrative. That's where art is sparked and discovered within and throughout and beyond. I really appreciate your music and what you do, thank you for the songs you write and the art you share. \"travel the walk over the into the back to the\" Of course I'm sure this is self explanatory, following the previous lyric. Yes, the meaning is very immediate. 'back to the...' ...future.The true meaning of the song is back to the future. time travel through alternate realities with marty mcflie (tom holland) and doc ock",
        "answer": "all roads lead to musical happiness. start anywhere. after writing a lot of songs, you look for the roads less traveled. perhaps i'm trying to create something extremely \"prose\" and then let the joys of music prove that you can musicify anything, including the proseyest things. by \"prosey\" i suppose i mean like not written with any expected rhythm or rhyme scheme. if you looked at the lyrics alone you probably wouldn't even assume it was a song. also the flying comes as a surprise. i'm sure i genuinely wasn't even expecting the flying by the time i'd reached \"sandals.\" even though i'm sure i came up with the whole line just about in real time. So in other words, basically i'm just attempting to enjoy the sensation of dreaming while awake. or at least try my best to achieve that i wasn't necessarily thinking of flying here. it looks like i was just continuing the same soft prosey strategy. again, i could have been as late as \"was\" and still had no idea exactly *when* (rhythmically) the line might end. and yet i certainly knew what the meaning of the phrase was by the time i hit \"travel the distance\". the rest of the line is sort of an exercise in free will to see how many times i could surprise myself with number of syllables the sentence turned out to actually have. despite already knowing from the beginning of the line what information it was going to be paraphrasing (travel from point A to point B) i think it's the least interesting part so far. sounds like it was lifted from some nursery rhyme the sky and sun have been up there all my life. so they both commonly come to mind often. so that 'connection' is probably shared by a huge percentage of my songs. unless i'm deliberately trying to cut back i guarantee i was not thinking about flying at this point. given the carefree attitude of this song, i'd assume that pretty much everything in here so far, including the sandals, sky, the flying, are part of a floaty collage of aesthetics here in addition to that technique, i also used another balancing trick on a doubled timescale here, which is where half the page is filled with words (etc), and the other half of the page just has 1 word. (future). so it sort of invokes a comparison of \"everything to 1\". which is an interesting ratio for those following along mathematically seems like a double negative is achieved in that line somehow. again probably attempting to dream while i'm awake. sometimes saying things backwards is a nice way to throw off the boring non-dreaming part of the brain. which i suppose would be the frontal lobe for those of you following along neurologically i can tell you that the musical/lyrical echo is the primary reason for this line's existence. i guess it's that part of the second verse where it's time to be mildly responsible in the songwriting. it echoes the 'some people wonder', and instead of \"sun\" it's \"moon\", which felt like the standard verse 1 to 2 transferrence. and the rest of the line is just the best option i could come up with for finishing it. it also seems to generally play a 3rd above the first verse's line, (not to mention an actual harmony added above it here) which playes into the mention of 'decoration', and it is 'later' in 2 ways actually, because the this verse's line comes later than the first, but, also because the vocal singing the higher harmony here came later than the lead possibly true i recall 'galaxy' being some kind of freudian slip at one point while i was running through the first bridge. so i earmarked it for the second true i can tell you that a big part of the reason this line is built the way it is is to juggle the rhythm and surprise myself as much as possible. basically to keep the sentence going as long as possible, causing a long string of 'challenges' to the rhythm and then see if i can maneuver it into a musically and linguistically coherent landing. it's kind of like when pilots repeatedly try to damage their airplane while in flight, to challenge themselves to create increasingly more interesting landings. But, besides the rhythm and music there, the words are also describing when you get that much deeper into a story and you've developed a deeper familiarity with the story's world that those outside this story might not share that is generally the preferred target to hit, as per company policy i'll grab any souvenir i can, for proof of not copy-pasting i basically poured my heart out in the previous couple of lines, and i understood that i'd probably completely submerged myself beyond any chance of getting myself back out in any 'normal'ish way, so, ....... i sort of figured i might as well become an alien at this point...... froze the harmony on a sort of ambiguosly not-really-stable but not-really-unstable, semi-awkward place, and then rigidly went to prose to literally explain what a diligent artist surely often tries to do, in situations where they encounter an inspiring situation or moment. simply try to capture it, like a scientist would capture some kind of specimen yep, i am a flipsman all too frequently i will confess actually, i was just trying to promote unconditional understanding. \"if ____ happens, i'll understand.\" more of a spiritual vibe here while also eagerly taking the chance to prove i did not copy-paste for me, a back to the future reference would have michael j fox instead, but, it's not a back to the future reference. these last vocals are trying to increase the chances that you will want to go back to the beginning and listen again"

        "question": "In \"might quit\" there's a line that goes \"Hello it's a Tuesday show cause Wednesday seemed so long ago. I said it 3 or 4 songs ago\" this line stumped me for the longest time cause I couldn't quite figure out what it was referring to: the past 3 or 4 songs uploaded to your channel didn't feature anything like that, nor were they uploaded on Tuesdays. However, I just thought about it a different way and realised the line could've been specifically referring to *you* saying it, meaning that it'd have been either the 3rd or 4th most recent video (up to might quit's release) in which you were present yourself on a green screen, the 4th of which was \"maybe i could eat blades of grass\", a video about a show called maybe i could eat blades of grass, uploaded on a tuesday, in which you show up on a green screen and are always shown singing to the host, Damien Shmamdian. Was this the \"Tuesday show\" that Might Quit was referencing?",
        "answer": "that's not true. that line is from a different song i actually think all of them were uploaded on tuesday, regardless of whether you're talking about 3 or 4 before the song you mentioned, or, 3 or 4 before the song that actually contains the line you mentioned that's impossible. there is no green screen in that video. i didn't have a green screen until later. the first video i used it for was \"hello sexy pants\" that song never references a tuesday show, but the \"tuesday show\" line (in another song) doesn't have to refer to anything, but, it reminds me of how i've always aspired to have a regular presentation of audio/visual content (such as a video or music video), and my preferred weekday to choose for this has typically been Tuesday, and still is"

In the last chorus, however, on the the \"whoa\", there's 3 chords. if you consider 3 melody notes (A, G, F) double each one a fourth above and a major 3rd above. so it's A C# D, then G B C, then F A Bb. I'm sure there were bass notes designated there also, but, on the recording, the bass seems to wander out for a bagel in that moment"

        "question": "Do you have any advice for how to get from playing something like a 4-chord progression with all the chords in root position in just one hand to being able to voice them well across both hands like in actual songs? I've been having trouble trying to think of the notes of the next chord and then finding a good way to get to each of them from the notes of the current chord I'm playing quickly enough to not break rhythm",
        "answer": "get some songbooks (with chord symbols in them). then go through each of the songs (at any speed. stop as much as you want). and make a rule for yourself, of your highest and lowest note that you will be using in the chords. Maybe something like the first G below middle C, and the first A above middle C. Also allow yourself a bass note in a different range, how about between 1 and 2 C's below middle C. so each chord will have 1 note in the bass range, and... about 3 notes in the middle range. you're allowed to omit the bass note from the non-bass range. Then just go through the songbooks and find all the chords, in these ranges. you'll get used to all the patterns very quickly. you'll also start to enjoy the music much more because it will sound better"

        "answer": "just about well, no, the drum groove probably had no effect on this fine, but the next section or even the start time of the next section was not previously known until that riff existed. so it's not like the riff had any constraints, really. the bigger factor in my feelings was, 'i hope this next section works' because the section that follows was the 3rd major rewrite. there were 2 entirely different alternate endings"

        "answer": "no. \"pave the way\" is about bravely moving toward the future. then, the second time, \"it's already been paved today\" came about because i was 80% sure that i wanted to do that chorus again right there, but the problem is that that \"pave the way\" line seems to be most effective when it feels \"new\". the line seemed to lose its effectiveness when being said the second time. But i found that by dropping down to a lower range and going \"it's already been paved today\", it made the whole thing land better and solved that problem"

Also the entire outtro (\"good times\") section, i never even conceived a time signature. it just dangles with no idea of barlines. i had to put some temporary cue clicks in there to count me into the vocals because the time is so dizzying to keep track of. so for this roadmap i just gave you, for the outtro, i just came up with one of many possible ways to put the barlines. who knows, you might do some math and find out that the entire thing could be in 4 and come out even"

        "question": "I have all these lyrics and song concepts floating around in my head but I can never bring a full song out of them because they're all disconnected i.e. each line belongs to an entirely different song and cannot possibly be connected to the rest. How do I get my brain to use one of these lines and form something at least half decent? Also, i have a very vague understanding of music theory and every time I try to write a melody, it ends up sounding more like an instrumental part of whatever song, so I can't use music theory to figure out what chord progression would work out best with whatever tune I just hummed out and use that to try and create a melody or whatever. It's just so frustrating having all these ideas and tunes but never being able to do anything with them. Pls send help.",
        "answer": "just write them all down in a list and eventually you'll figure something out. sometimes the only way through this is to pretend you are in a contest for worst song ever written. this may help you get into the game of things"

        "question": "I just found a fucked up thing about music, like Lovecraftian horror levels of fucked up. The circle of fifths going up by sharps, right? Each key's tonic becomes the new sharp of the key two fifths further along in the circle. If you're in the key of B, go back two keys to A, then A\u266f is the last sharp of B. So what if the circle didn't end? What if I continued the circle? What if I wrote G\u266f? F double sharp, Bill. A black and unspeakable curse writ only by the dark lords of music, long before the Universe began. If I treasured dear life, I should have ventured no further. But I was already too far gone. One by one, I sharpened the sharps in the key signature. Every single one. And when I entered the key of G double sharp- It never stops. It's sharps forever, all the way into musical infinity. I can never return to sanity. I stared into the abyss, and it stared back into me. I'm scared, Bill. What ever will I do?",
        "answer": "sure you can. you can just go back the other way i understand. the night sky seems like that you can just stay on earth. if there's too many sharps you can just take away 7 (or add 7 flats, and the flats and sharps cancel out). If you are writing, you'll have to re-write but just move everything up or down one line/space"

        "question": "so, after like 5 years of doing absolutely nothing, i might finally be brave enough to start creating music. but how do i know what kind of music i want to create? i have no clear vision or goal in my mind. i have feelings i would like to express, but i don't know how my feelings \"sound\" yet. i have a digital piano and a mixing software and i'm still going nowhere... HOW DO I START MOVING",
        "answer": "here's a trick that might get you through this..... try caring about what kind of words you say and when. in otherwords, try writing the material before you set foot in the production environment. after all, this is what's done with almost all movies, tv shows, and probably most songs also. all of my songs are written before they are produced. it's similar to making the blueprint of a house before building the house. starting in the production environment with no song written reminds me of showing up to a house construction site with no blueprint for the house. it took a couple of years for this realization to occur to me, but i was much much happier when it did"

Or no change whatsoever as you keep going down a more determined, safer road. It inspires resilience and perseverance even if you don't end up starting a revolution.

        "question": "Why have a double sharp or flat ever? Wouldn't it just be better to make it the note that's already in the time signature?",
        "answer": "key signature, yes. but, picture this: you're in the key of Bmaj and something is happening around the G#min key center which gets a lot of melodic action on the G and G# notes. Imagine you are on the music staff........ what a headache it would be to switch back and forth constantly between G and G# with accidentals. So you'll wanna put it on different letters, so you can just put the noteheads in the 2 neighboring line/spaces. otherwise they'd all be on the same line/space, with alternating accidentals stuffed in between each one. what a headache that would be. Sure, you may be wishing we'd been calling this whole situation in Abmin..... in which case i hope you like Cb and Fb, because we'd be coming from the key of Cb (featuring lots of Fb's of course). Now, suppose you are saying, wait no, how about i can have my cake and eat it too, we'll call it the key of B, which contains the note Ab and the key of Ab minor. Well then guess what, your regular scale is going to have Ab, Bb, B. so then every melody is going to be chock full of interplay between Bb and B. which would of course have to be stuffed on the same line with alternating accidentals to make your eyeballs explode. Ok sure, fine, i know what you're thinking, why can't we have the key of B with A#, then Ab below that. Well, ...... congratulations, now the regular 6 and 7th scale degrees of your melody are always going to have to be stuffed on the same line, again, with alternating accidentals lodged in between them. So as you can see, this is a lot like getting a wrinkle out of a spherical blanket..... which reminds me....... the circle of fifths does indeed have a wrinkle. you can chase the wrinkle around the circle as far as you want but it will always be somewhere. of course you could do it without the wrinkle, but if you go genuinely around 12 steps you will actually be slightly off from the original key. so indeed the connectivity of the 12 step program is a cheat"

        "question": "what are your songwriting procedures and processes?",
        "answer": "2 totally separate departments are at play here: 'GENERATION' (also known as 'song gen'), and 'WORK' (also known as 'finishing the song now'). they are not done with the same rules, nor under the same pretext, nor in the same context, nor at the same time, nor for the same reason. it's almost as if they are not even done by the same person. different floor of the building. different personality type best suited for each of these 2 departments. 'GENERATION' (songgen) procedures and practices: 1. in the best case, the ideas will come to you, not on a songgen session. any other time. music has a spirit of its own, and unfortunately cannot be reliably ordered around. in other words, the truest ideas will come to you at the exact opposite time from when you had planned to find them. For this, you just need to work on your quick-catch techniques. what's the quickest way you can accurately remember the melody/chord/words/etc that just occurred to you, and is it within reach at a moment's notice. handheld audio recording works fine. Handwriting or text works ok, if you have sufficient notation for representing specific melodic/rhythmic/chordal information. 2. specific melodic/rhythmic/chordal information, if it's brand new, by default will not be remembered by you later. that's because, so far, you're the only one who's heard it, and you only heard it once so far. so don't underestimate the importance of documenting the melody, rhythm, and exact words, specifically. the first way you heard it is usually the truest. this is why it's important to catch it and document it. file it into a list and date it. unless you just really don't like it, then whatever, let that one go. 3. besides the lovely surprise of accidental songgen (unplanned, could be rare.... unpredictable, unreliable), you can also do deliberate songgen. In this case, you will deliberately try to make yourself as comfortable as possible (or whatever other mood you prefer) and deliberately start trying to come up with ideas. from anywhere. based on anything, not based on anything. can't come up with any ideas? how about coming up an idea for an idea. etc etc. Don't worry, you won't be actually working on it. no working in the songgen department. save the work for the work department. 4. it's important to remember, on a deliberate songgen session, the first 2 or 3 of a songgen session often are deeply useless and unfilfilling. bad, not good, etc., so don't be alarmed if it seems hopeless to get into it at first. if you can get past these first 2 or 3, it almost always picks up fancifully somewhere among the first 10. you may still feel frustrated that you didn't get enough good ones, but i think you'll find if you do 10 or 20, you'll find that if you look back at them in a day or 2, at least some of them will be just what you always wanted. and again, be prepared also that some of them will not. 5. that's all there is to songgen. no part of the songgen process shall ever be concerned or obligated to finish or produce any of these items. different department, different world. 'work' department: finishing a song, now. wait, hold on, i almost forgot, ????????????which one??????????? and that reminds me of the department that goes in between the 2 departments. 'SELECTION' 1. so, by some other means, you've determined, that at this time in your life you are going to produce a song. now. (in some specified timeframe, or in earnest expedience, whichever is sooner). Which reminds me, this information would have come from the scheduling department or life goals department.... something like that. but for whatever reason, you've become sure beyond the jurisdiction of this departmant ('selection') that you shall now complete and produce a song. you just don't know WHICH one, and that is the job of this department (the selection department). 2. perhaps life is just running so smoothly at the moment that you just happen to know which song you are moved to produce next, and have absolutely no anxiety about whether it's exactly the right choice for you to dedicate the full force and resources of the production departments to it, for however long it takes. perhaps you're in such a carefree mood about this that, despite loving the song enough to choose it, you also have no anxiety about the possibility of screwing it up. in that case, congratulations, your selection is done, and you can move on to the songwriting/work and production departments. 3. in case it's not so easy, you can begin the pre-selection. Go through the entire list of everything you have. anything that puts you in a good mood, add it to the selection list (this will be a temporary list, that only applies to this selection process this time.) 4. you may find yourself thinking defensively. thinking categorically you think you don't want to produce a song at X tempo, or in X type of keycenter, or with X subject matter, ....... or maybe you're trying obsessively avoid the details you did on the last song.... maybe you're avoiding things that accidentally seem to reference current events in ways you didn't intend. etc etc. In some ways, i guess defensive thinking can be good. i mean you probably don't want to produce 2 songs in a row with the same title. (but... actually.... why not?) or 2 in a row at the exact same tempo, or..... something. But, i think you'll notice as you go through the list, you may go through a 'defensive' spell, and find yourself rejecting almost everything. and then, other times, you may be in a more lighthearted mood, and find yourself accepting almost everything. So, i'd suggest, try to think more along the lines of \"anything in this list is guaranteed to either be already good, or, be able to be made good.\" and that's simply true, even in actual garbage cans. 5. Once you complete this list, here's where you have 2 options going forward. go straight to brute random selection, or do one more round through the pre-selection to 'prepare for brute random selection.' 6. if you choose to go through the pre-selection again, here's the thing to beware of: don't do it defensively. don't \"narrow it down\". You will eliminate everything, and be confused and have to start over. If you go around again, adhere as much as you can to the golden rule of \"ANY of these can be made to be the best choice, IF\"... and for each one, remember that any of them can work, and ask yourself what would the thing be to make this one work. And often this will lead you accidentally to a small bit of additional writing/arranging/decision on it, and THEN, hopefully you will have that one feeling nice and hot to add to the final random-ready list, and i'd say try to get this final list up to at least 4 items, by the same 'what would it take' question, and that should hopefully get you a small handful of items which would have some brand new details on them, made during this selection process, and hopefully by now you should have such raving desire to do all of them that your biggest dread will actually be that most of these will not be selected. 7. on the other hand, if you are feeling like you just can't get away from the defensive thinking, and your mood is not the greatest, then you are always invited to jump to brute random selection, IMMEDIATELY after that first round of pre-selection. don't even look at them. just count them up, input the quantity, and get your answer. and that is the selection. After all, these all made it to pre-selection, so you're fine. The only reason i no longer recommend a full brute random selection from the entire list (no pre-selection) is because, well........ put it this way, ... it's probably possible for the timing to be just too bad. like let's say there's a guy named .. i dunno.. 'Sam' who is currently all over the news for .... something bad, let's say. doing crimes, or something. etc etc. Like, maybe this week in the news let's say there's a real bad guy in the news named Sam. Well, and let's say you happen to have a song in your list called \"i really like Sam, he's a good guy and he's friends with me.\" written years ago, about a totally different Sam (a nice Sam) before anyone had heard of the bad Sam guy. The pre-selection is mostly just to prevent you from doing that Sam song that particular week. 8. also, after you get your selection, if you wake up the next morning and suddenly feel like the selection is all wrong, don't worry. it's gonna be fine, as long as you know you followed your selection procedure to the best of your ability at the time the 'WORK' department (when you are tasked to finish writing, and produce, the selected song, in the alotted time, or in earnest expedience, whichever is quicker). 1. do you trust the selection (are you convinced that this is the song to be writing right now, to produce next)... just kidding, if you don't trust the selection by now then that means your selection process is faulty and you might as well spiral into a tailspin of confusion. but the selection is fine, because all selections are technically going to be fine 2. have you written the beginning yet 3. if not, figure out what can go at the beginning 4. if you have written the beginning, figure out what goes next 5. if the first part you came up with was not the beginning, and if you now have a beginning but it does not yet connect to the other part you had first, well then you've got yourself a fun puzzle 6. out of what you've written so far, find out how much consecutive material you can accept, starting from the beginning. if it becomes unacceptable to you at any point, then the point just before it became unacceptable is known as the split point 7. continue coming up with the next part after the split point, and don't forget to at least partially consider that at each moment the next right move could be to end it. try to keep an open mind about both ending and non-ending solutions, categorically, in each moment 8. the best time you'll really know what's what, is on a clean run-through. this is when you play through the song, in real time, basically simulating how it will feel for someone to hear it, from the beginning. The effectiveness of these runthroughs at generating the truest genuine songwriting results will mostly depend on how much time has recently elapsed with you NOT hearing the song. i know this has very counterproductive implications 9. if you've re-written a part more than 4 times, you might be cursed for the moment, and the truest thing by default here should be to go with version 1, (and being prepared to hate it, temporarily). the only other real solution here is to spend an extra long amount of time without hearing the song. 10. if time is limited and you don't have time to spend away from the song, try submerging your face in ice cold water and then returning to work. you'll forget what was wrong"

        "answer": "the whole ending feels like it's a result of the circumstances for the beginning. which is, for whatever reason, it had been decided that i was beginning a mandatory production schedule where i produce a song and music video in a much quicker time period than i thought possible. 'front door' was the first one i was doing for that schedule. the first couple of sections were written in a pretty optimistic and good mood about the task at hand. then panic set in as i realized i have much less time than what feels comfortably necessary to write a good song. (this scenario led me into the \"sign\" bit). and so on, through some precarious rambles, and then, like the weather it turned good. from \"do everything\", that whole section all the way to the end i was having a very good day, certainly very optimistic that the quickness was both available and effective"

Just after \"this is the only restaurant that still serves food\", there was an opportunity there to jump into a small song bit i've had for a long time. However, i realized that i might not want to go there, so i also wrote a backup option, which is something else that happens in the room where their table is. Unfortunately i'm a complete idiot and forgot that they're actually on the roof, and this other bit is completely impossible on the roof. it's too bad i couldn't use that part because that was one of my favorite parts. that line was also written in the script with \"--\" next to it, but i removed it from the version i posted here, because i don't want to give away that bit. i will hopefully use it later"

I think i realized the plate debacle somewhere in pre-production, and it was troubling to me too, because i was imagining the backfork person pushing them around a plate. But after thinking long and hard about it, i realized there is no way to deliver corn in a surprising manner like that, with plates. And also, i decided it would be inappropriate to have the table start with empty plates. It turns out, i was in for a nice surprise when i found out that the table cloths have a plaid square pattern on them, which is a perfect sort of game board to play with, pushing corn around"

Unfortunately this still isn't really the most authentic result, because the door would have to be spring loaded for it to look like this. What i was originally looking for was something where the first panel moves until it mostly unfolds and then the next panel moves, etc, and i know it's possible to do this but i think it would venture further into calculus than i was ready for at the time"

Upon failing this pursuit due to his environment, he quickly associates that part of his life to be tainted, and quickly abandons it. Finally free of the perceived toxicity he just rid his life of, he tries again, feeling confident that a new environment will surely fix the issues, only for a new problem to arise instead. He responds to this by shelving his pursuits for a while and abandoning the environment, but this time planning to return. Am I overthinking a goofy animation?",

So un-eliminated all of them and then deliberately chose what seemed like the worst one, which was only \"just did a bad thing\" and not much else. 2: i was aggressively failing to meet my deadlines for the release of the song and video, and they ended up being released separately and both later than i wanted"

        "question": "do the colors on the juggling stick things in \"out to lunch\" have any meaning or are they just colors",
        "answer": "i almost wanted them to be the same color, but the reason it's important that they are different colors is because this is an animation (not real) so it's technically more powerful to prove that there are actually 3 clubs. Otherwise it might feel like the animation loop is only 1/3 of the length it actually is. it's important to see the individual clubs changing hands. I made the juggling animation first, and i had 3 different colors just so i could tell them apart. Then i modeled the rooms and did the rest of the animation. Then i had to deal with whether the colors looked good with the scene. There are several moments where 1 club is featured (thrown into the ceiling tile, or onto the light, or when the last 2 go up to the atrium.) So i needed to find a color scheme which looked good with all 3 together, and, also looked good when the individual ones are featured. And switching the clubs at that point was out of the question. so i had to juggle the colors around a bit to make all the scenes look good with the same color scheme. That is generally the meaning of colors: how they look, and how the look feels. And with 3 different but consistent interchanging items, that became somewhat of a puzzle for me"

That got me thinking about how the mug of an artist plastered on something is quite often how music is marketed, and that much of musical imagery is focused around the artist themselves. This is in contrast with using imagery that is not focused on a person, things that are abstract and represent the tone and feeling of whatever music they are paired with. Imagery is a big part of your music, so i was wondering if you had any thoughts on this.",
        "answer": "music is kind of a secret/special sauce. So this begs the question: how do you eat just the sauce? The idea of paying attention to music separately is actually kind of weird...... and truly it's almost impossible to actually pay direct attention to only music. i think you'll find that SOMETHING has to take the focus. and often, by default, it's the identity of the artist the music is associated with"

        "answer": "it might be called a \"ruff\" well, one way is to just get a recording (sample) of someone actually playing that. but the problem there is, it's not very 'playable' for you because you won't have good control over when the final attack is. so if you want something usable, you'll want a steady sample of a continuous drum roll, with fast attack and fast release, so it starts and stops immediately when you press or lift the key, and then you'll want a separate sample, on another key, for a normal snare hit. and then you can play both keys to time the ruffs any way you want. And of course, for decent results, you'll want to make them both dynamic sensitive, and have many different versions of the sample, for different loudness levels, and also many different versions for the same loudness level, so they don't all sound identical"

These are the functional categories i use for mixing, and for that purpose the category devisions are nearly rock solid. Within the non, there's always a vague attempt to find some categories for arrangement purposes, but the lines always get blurred and break down and argue about how specific to be or not. lead, pno, rhodes, organ, bell, guit, strings, twinkle, pluck, pad, flute, syn, horn, trumpet, miscnon, ..... as you can see there would be a lot of overlap and many things can be used for both, so there never seems to be clarity on that level. i've noticed the same thing when trying to deal with the categorization of my website. at a certain point you just have to accept that real life ultimately will resist total categorization, yet always seems to invite you to try"

Then i can imagine another right triangle with that hypotenuse, the outer edge of the cube, and the grand diagonal (the one you're looking for). so it should be 1 squared plus \u221a2 squared equals answer squared.... 1 plus (root 2 squared) is 3.... the answer should be the square root of 3.

(also 2:55 A.M. or P.M.?) 2. what is he humming when he walks in the kitchen? a song (maybe one of yours, bill?) or just a random tune or something? 3. what is he placing in the door handle of the kitchen cabinet/cupboard? 4. are his ceiling tiles faulty or do they fall out easily when they're hit w/ something? 5. who's calvin? 6. is the going-out-to-lunch-guy's name \"dan smith\"? 7. is he single, given the \"looking for love? join a club\" poster? 8. are his juggling clubs somehow defying the laws of physics? and how the heck were they able to balance themselves on top of those light fixtures? (like dangm that's impressive.) 9. how come there's like a gzbijhfillion electric sockets in the dude's house? 10. why does the fire extinguisher say \"Water\" on it? because the fire extinguisher foam that sprays out the fire extinguishers is essentially just water to put out fires? is there water in the fire extinguisher? and yes i know there's a lot of questions, and i ask a lot of questions, but i hope you don't mind. just felt curious about some of those things that I found/noticed in the video. thanks, bill!",
        "answer": "for reasons probably not related to the clock. probably wanted to process some of the recent occurrences must be PM because it seems to be day time outside nothing specific. just casual something casual that works with the scene the ball he was tossing neither. it takes a fairly heavy object, thrown fairly hard, to knock out one of those ceiling tiles a cartoon character which seemed to have body proportions and stature which i've only ever seen in 'calvin and hobbes' i doubt it that's an advertisement board. i don't think he put those there only on special occasions computer graphics there's not that many. it is probably the standard amount for that type of building, which i believe is not exactly a house i assume that's normal something along those lines you're welcome"

        "question": "could you elaborate on the 'dos and donts of speech bubble placement'?",
        "answer": "sure. when the camera is very far away, obviously the speech bubble needs to be huge in the scene, in order to be a reasonable size on screen. And it needs to point directly to the characters. but the problem that sometimes happens is, there might be a tree or something closer to the camera than the character, which occupies the screenspace where the speech bubble goes. so if you put the speech bubble in the right place on the screen, it will either be partially obscured by the tree, or, it will disobey the laws of occlusion and be in front of the tree when it shouldn't be. I discovered that, if the camera is totally still, in most cases, you can get away with this. in other words, you can put a speech bubble which appears to point to the character on the 2D screenspace, even if its 3D placement would be impossible. in reality, it's actually a much smaller speech bubble, much closer to the camera, and its position is adjusted so it looks like it points to the character, even though if it were actually next to the character it would be behind the tree. So i've learned that you can usually get away with that when the camera is totally still. But when the camera is slightly moving, this absolutely does not work. There is a shot in the most recent video where the camera is across the street, looking toward the characters through the trees. To put the speech bubble actually next to the characters, it would be entirely obscured by the trees. If i cheat the speech bubble and put it in front of the trees, but smaller, this is a disaster because the camera is drifting slightly, and it becomes glaringly obvious that the bubble is much closer to the camera. So i tried to linearly keyframe the speech bubble to stay positioned next to the character, in 2D screen space. This is an even bigger disaster, and it looks like the scene is broken because the bubble is behaving as if it should be behind the tree, but it actually obscures the tree. Then i tried it with the speech bubble in the same place, but a longer stem reaching mostly back away from the camera toward the character. again, with the drifting camera, as the shape of the speech bubble is revealed, it looks truly bizarre. i ended up having place the bubble far off to the right, outside the trees, and make a very long tail on the 2D plane. which looks a little ridiculous and i didn't really want to do it that way, but i tried absolutely every other way, and it's the only thing that seemed to work. And i've also seen it done in comic books, so it's probably the best way"

        "question": "is your screenwriting process very linear, or do your scripts go through multiple passes? i know you've shared the original draft for the rabbit video along with the updated \"final\" script, but even the \"final\" script is different from the video. e.g., your omission of: 1. (person has looked at the caption, to his upper right) 2. damn, 3. phone: 'have you tried going on the internet'? what informs these decisions? how exactly does your process look like? how do you edit the original draft; i.e., do you go through it over and over from beginning to end, or do you \"jump around,\" so to speak, or a mix of both? thanks",
        "answer": "i would prefer not to keep editing it, because i think the first way is usually the most genuine. it gets tricky when you try to pull things apart from the inside....... but what can you do. if part of it sucks, then you gotta get into some surgery and pray for a good outcome it should be noted that the 'have you tried going on the internet' has a dash - written at the beginning of the line. that is my notation for this line is cut (cancelled). so that decision was already made. For the person looking at the caption, to the right, .... well, i think i just forgot to do that. Quite often, and i'm not proud of this, quite often i notice after i've finished producing a video, if i look back at the script there are various nuances that just got forgotten. Usually that's because once i've recorded the audio for the vocal, i don't check the script again. perhaps i should. Or, maybe, in this case, it might be the result of the fact that i went with a full-screen separate card for that announcement, so it wouldn't make any sense to have the character look at it. If someone had made me aware of that detail, i may have decided not to do it anyway i don't make any changes unless i have to. i just do a full readthrough, and if there are any parts that just really make me miserable, then inevitably something has to be done, somehow"

        "question": "Could you share your rules of capital letter usage?",
        "answer": "it's not perfectly defined, but some of the general principles are: chord symbols are always capitalized (except for \"b\" when it's used to mean \"flat\"). Acronyms are almost always capitalized. the letter L is often capitalized whenever it would otherwise be in danger of being confused for I or 1. the letter \"i\" when referrring to self is never capitalized. the start of sentences may occasionally need to be capitalized if i feel there is a tone change, or if there should be a decisive break in between sentences, OR if there seems to be a lot of other punctuation in the area and it would otherwise be unclear that it's the start of a new sentence. It's used for emphasis, the same way bold would be used, and the reason i prefer capitals instead of bold is because it's much more likely that the capitals will actually show up on any device, where as bold might get lost somehow. And also if i'm just simply referring to the letter itself, such as the letter F, it is most often capitalized, because that is probably the way that most people think of individual letters. The exception to that, of course, would be the letter \"i\", which, again, for similar reasons to why L sometimes gets capitalized more often, \"i\" should be capitalized less often because, similarly, it runs the risk of being confused with l or 1. I also often use capitalization for signage, especially with short contents, such as \"STOP\" or \"EXIT\", especially when i am trying to replicate signage that people are familiar with in the outside world"

In videos since then, i haven't recorded any more sounds, i've just gone back to the recording session for the juggling video and i've been able to get whatever i need from there"

Then i get a timeline going, set the metronome, and record some temp instruments just for the purpose of singing final vocal over it, then record all vocals. then remove all temp instruments and then arrange and record the instruments. then mix"

        "answer": "this could be a blessing. maybe you can find 1 sound in the keyboard and then learn to just play it while singing at the same time. and then record that on 1 microphone, like the one on your phone. there's a lot you probably want to learn about yourself and how you make music, and usually it's best to just start with the simplest thing that's available. you don't even know what you want yet, and the advantage with using exactly what you have is it's probably a unique set of tools that aren't exactly what any other person has. you're gonna have a unique sound automatically. it reminds me of that guy that lived next to a spatula, so he made spatula music. there's not very much spatula music out there, so, someone's gotta do it"

        "answer": "a lot of people do it without knowing it. they'll put 3/4 on the page and have tiny bars when it really might have been better to say 6/4. there's no reason 'we wish you a merry christmas', 'happy birthday', 'you make me feel like a natural woman', and trillions of other popular songs from every generation wouldn't really be better off saying 6/4 on the page. or, depending on the tempo, be converted to 6/8 or even written as 4/4 and put everything in triplets. a lot of different notation options for songs in 3-feels. But songs with a 4-feel tend to just use 4/4 because it's all groups of 4 within groups of 4 within groups of 4, so 4/4 will always fit. I'd say about 20% of songs use some kind of 3-feel, and within that you're going to have a million different ways of writing the same thing. so those time signatures (6/4, 6/8, etc) would appear less common, but they are used for the same type of music which again i'd say comprises at least 10% of music from all generations"

For example, let's say the reason you are asking this is because last night you walked past a music venue that said \"jazz\" on it, and it made you feel good for whatever reason and that's what made you think that what you're looking for is probably called 'jazz'. Or maybe you met a cool person who told you they like 'jazz'. Either way, your best option is to recall the scenario that inspired this desire, and go back there and you'll probably find a trail of bread crumbs from there to your next destination"

But i know all about what they sound like, and i use the sound for similar situations as things like xylophone or marimba. the kalimba sounds similar but usually there is a bit of a 'fuzz' or rattle sound to it. it probably shows up in just about every arrangement i put out, because there are always several of them in my repository and i tend to like the sound and find it useful. then again, i think there are also some other instruments i have which sound similar but are named differently. my arrangement process usually does not involve looking up instruments by name"

Or is there a feel difference? Like, as a drummer, would you play differently for a song that was notated as 3/4 vs 6/4?",
        "answer": "sure. although a lot of people make weird choices........ 3/4 is more popular but that usually makes the bars tiny (depending on the tempo). because most songs with a 3-feel have the little beats going by at a much faster tempo than quarter notes would usually be. on the other hand, if you consider the whole group of 3 as one beat, you can use 4/4 and put the whole thing in triplets. but that would actually make the bars 4 times longer. possibly too long. in these situations where 3/4 is too tiny and 4/4 with triplets is too long, i usually go with 6/8, which keeps the note values at about the speed you'd expect them to be, and it keeps the bar size at a comfortable speed of about 2 or 3 seconds per bar, as it probably would be in most 4/4 songs you'd never know until you get to know the song. it's like the difference between people named jamie and people named jerry"

        "question": "so let's say you have a the number 0.444444444 repeating infinitely. infinitely EXCEPT you're told that the number 5 MIGHT be in the digits somewhere. you don't know if the number 5 is anywhere in there, but you have to completely round it to the nearest whole number. if there's a 5 somewhere in there, then all the 4s before it correct to a 5 and it ends up rounding to a 1. but if there isn't, the 4s remain and it rounds to a 0. you don't have infinite time to check for the 5. what do you round it to, 0 or 1?",
        "answer": "what? what? clearly 0. there's no reason to round it to 1 unless you are following some bizzaro rounding rules. the number is significantly closer to 1, no matter what. .44445, .445, .45, heck even .4999999 are unambiguously closer to 1. the only way that .4444444444445 could possibly end up as 1 is if the number is being rounded 1 digit at a time, over and over again, destructively. and if that happens then the process needs to be fixed because that's a serious corruption. rounding the entire number at once, it unquestionably goes down. there's no rule in the world that says even .45 should go to one, any more than 45 should go to 100. again, the only way 45 goes to 100 is if one person rounded 45 to 50 and then handed it off to someone else without telling them that it came from 45 and then that second person took the new 50 and rounded it to 100. in which case, again, there is a serious communication breakdown here which is corrupting the results and should be investigated"

        "question": "I accidentally came up with a super cool melody with awesome chords... but no lyrics. What do you recommend I do here? I worry that anything I come up with will feel forced",
        "answer": "it's there. if the melody and chords really are super cool, then there is a lyricized version that does work. there are a few tricks to help hone in on it. gather the tiny details that you think you know, or almost know. For example: maybe you know a certain word works really well for part of it, for example let's say the word 'banana' just sounds perfect for the last part of it. Or, maybe you know banana sounds great for that part but you doubt it should be about bananas. Add that factoid to your list of factoids, regardless. write down that you love the word banana at the end but you're not sure if it could work. See if you can hone in on any other things you know, about other tiny parts of it. What can you rule out? what can you rule in? Here's another exercise: just start coming up with as many phoenecically functional things as possible that fit, without regard for what you want it to mean. This will help you notice things: for example you might notice that 80% of the results are phrased as a question. You may notice that these 2 little notes there are always either \"in the\" or \"and it\". You may notice that certain phrases keep fitting a certain part, over and over. Now, on the other side of the coin, here's a totally different exercise to try: paraphrase the whole feeling of it, without the melody. so just write down, in as many words as you like, what you think the melody is saying, without worrying about how many words or syllables you use. anything you can grasp onto. maybe you think it has a feeling of freshness. maybe you think it has a feeling of 'morning'. maybe you think it has a feeling of sorrow. maybe you think it has a feeling of good news. write down as much as you can about what you think the melody feels like. Then, maybe certain key words will pop out at you that possibly DO fit. And most importantly, regardless of whether any of this works, going through all this makes it much more likely that the answer will actually just fall on your head later when you're not even thinking about it"

They may acquire that feeling for someone specific, if they happened to fins it connecting with a memory, but isn't that kind of sad? Do you have any thoughts on the matter?",
        "answer": "yes you can, but you can't guarantee which song it's gonna be songwriting is unpredictable. each song becomes what it wants to become, and you can't really control it too much. the best thing you can do is keep experimenting and doing it with an open mind. it's frustrating but that's also what makes it magical"

        "answer": "yes, this makes sense. most people don't want to do what they don't want to do. one of the best ways to handle this is to better understand why you have to do it. who wants you to do it? why do they want you to do it? have you ever wanted someone else to do something? why did you want them to do it? the more you can close this gap, the more you can love and appreciate the task. And the other thing you can do is start thinking in more detail HOW you are going to do it. imagine you were going to teach someone else how to do it. confusion is very paralyzing, and developing a teachable understanding of any task can often be a great way in"

        "question": "hi bill, i'm starting to get into songwriting in the opposite way you did, where i'm writing songs before learning an instrument. like to write songs, i'm essentially singing the melody-lyric and tapping out a rhythm into the microphone, and writing down the lyrics so i remember them. this comes very easy to me, way easier than it does for you, like i can pretty much immediately come up with the next part of the song easily after listening / reading it through, or even just thinking about the song off-handedly, as long as i have enough mental energy (which hasn't been that often until recently due to my chronic illness, but that's another story entirely). it hasn't taken me much longer than like a couple hours or so to finish writing any of my full-length (like 2-3 minute) songs so far, one of them was even written in a half hour and i still really like it, although i haven't finished more than like 10 or 15 (i haven't counted yet), and my almost-finished songs have been at a similar pace too. as i've started. so the songwriting is going fantastic so far. anyways i'm getting off track, the problem is, i have little to no experience with any musical instrument, and know no way of coming up with chords other than entering the melody notes in a website to figure out the scale, looking up the notes & chords in that scale, and hoping for the best. do you have any tips for me to get better at using the instrument and learning how chords work naturally? since i know that's how you learned yours, and had pretty much the exact opposite problems as me when it came to writing & recording songs, so i wondered if you had any tips for a beginner approaching music in the opposite order as you, as a pretty confident songwriter only now approaching the instrument hurdle as a necessary way to get things recorded. thabks",
        "answer": "that's not really the opposite of how i do it. that's very similar to how i do it it comes easy for me too me too most often the best ones are the quickest just grab a keyboard and start playing with it. it's just like language. the only great way to learn it is to just jump in and start using it many many years ago maybe, but then i learned to push the instrumentalist out of the way and just write the song instead, and life got a lot more fun. one of the biggest breakthroughs was to do it away from the instrument. like in the library using only paper i'm not buying this whole opposite theory you have, but, .... think about this.... if it really is the opposite way, then how could i have any tips for that? it sounds like you think things are much easier for you than for me, and if that is the case then you should probably be giving me tips instruments are like langauges. just grab one and start living in it. you might be scared at how 'long it takes', but you can keep going forever and keep learning. the progress never stops, and it starts immediately, as soon as you first see the instrument"

        "answer": "it's not there, but you're gonna make me open it up and prove it. the flute has absolutely zero notes or sound after the end of bar 15 (where the riff is). but here are some audio clips to investigate whatever you actually are hearing, on the & of 4 ('world') in bar 16. (and for those of you counting along at home, the song starts on bar 2, with the pickup \"i'm\" being at the end of bar 1). so here is 6 beats starting from the top of the bar \"dreaming of a brand new world\", as is in the final mix: frontdoorbar16. And here is the same exact time range with the vocal muted: frontdoorbar16novoc. (i can already tell it's gonna be the rhodes). And here is the exact same time range with the drums and bass also muted: frontdoorbar16nodrbass. Here is just the \"world\" moment, with voc, drums, and bass muted: frontdoorworldnodrbass. it's getting more and more obvious, i think, that the only culprit here for what you've been hearing is the rhodes chord because it's the only thing playing that note at that time. but i'll give you each of the 3 instruments here individually anyway. Here is the bell, here is the pluck, (which, as can be heard in the other clips, is playing an E note at the moment in question. the 'D' note played in the pluck doesn't occur until the second 16th note of bar 17) And finally, here is the rhodes, which is playing an Asus4 chord, which of course includes the D note, which, while having absolutely nothing to do with the flute riff in the previous bar, is the only plausible explanation for what sound you're hearing here. And, just for the heck of it, here is the vocal for the word 'world', just in case there might be some resonance in there that's doing it"

        "question": "here's what i don't get about the theory that \"the universe is a simulation\"... if our universe is a simulation, that means that there must be a universe that runs this simulation. If there isn't one, and this \"simulation\" just exists on its own somehow, that would mean the distinction between \"real\" and \"simulation\" would be completely arbitrary. so there's another universe that runs this one. but if that's the case, that universe would be the \"real\" one, and you still run into the same issues that the simulation theory is trying to solve, because how did that universe come into being? is it ALSO a simulation? what about the universe controlling that simulation? you can't just keep going on infinitely, eventually you have to come across the \"original\" universe. but anyway... what are your thoughts on this",
        "answer": "i wonder what it would be a simulation of. if it's just a simulation of itself, then, that, i would argue, is the real thing. like if someone met you and said \"hey you look just like you. you remind me of you\" you'd say \"that's right idiot, i AM me\""

        "question": "bill i had a dream that was very similra to a memory from childhood (a good one) and all day ive been trying to remember that memory and its like 90% gone. I remember some places of that week, but aside from that I can't remember much. it's like at this point i miss remembering those things more than i miss those things, and it feels new and old at the same time? It's like I miss the idea of those memories more than the actual memories. in a sense it made me realize that i'll probably slowly start forgetting about today and closer days further in the future. Do you feel it too? Is art how you deal with that? is listening to music how you make this portals in the now to go back to in the future? Is it okay to forget some good times if I dont forget that they were there?",
        "answer": "just about that's one of the ways i think if you keep studying this you may find something quite alarming (or comforting, depenting on how you look at it): there's infinite times. infinite memories, infinite nostalgias, ...... we have them in dreams and don't remember most of them. there's infinite possible songs. this can be hard to cope with because the attachment to them can be so strong. and it doesn't mean you shouldn't get attached. please do get attached, and you can even compose new ones to share with others and get them attached. but be aware that there are infinite. which might seem like a hindrance to the attachment, but, it's really not. infinity is alarming but it's what the doctor ordered"

        "question": "if i wanted to improve my improvisation and/or songwriting, would it be useful to learn a new chord every day and see how it feels when played after/before/between/instead of other chords?",
        "answer": "no. i think doing this will trick you into becoming very uninspired, because a chord includes everything about how/when/where it was used, in the actual song or piece of music. And there's infinite hows/whens/wheres. and each of those things makes everything different about what the chord does. so what i'm saying is, you'll never be able to get a list of all those. So if you say you're gonna \"learn a chord\" every day, that implies that you're going to be getting them from some list, but there is no list. because it's infinite and there's no order. and some of them are the same, but all of them are the same and different from each other at the same time. Anyway, my point is, the only way to get chords is to either find them how they've already been used in music you know in love, or make them up entirely. so if you're doing it that way, then i think it could be cool. Anyway, for your situation i think i'd recommend 2 different things: 1 is songs/music. just study all the songs/music you actually know and love, and see what they're doing with chords. i think right now you might be expecting it to look like a shelf full of a cereal boxes, lined up like soldiers. but it's really not like that at all, and it's much more like a room full of furniture. that's the best way i can describe it. so if you're learning 1 \"piece\" of furniture per day, it's gonna be hard enough just to figure out what counts as 1 piece and what counts as 5. or what counts as just the space between the other furniture. anyway, i think you'll see what i mean once you dive into all your favorite songs. and there's another thing i would suggest, that's totally the opposite of studying songs. Just spend some separate time just going nuts on the instrument with a total blank canvas and no song or anything, total free time, next to an open window, and just let the demons fly right in. this is where you make up your own way of doing things. your own way of spending time, on the instrument. Just act like you're sitting in a giant barrel of untapped TIME. time to play any note, not play any note, or combination, for as long or not long as you can imagine. sometimes when doing this, using the pitch bend a little bit can be insanely helpful. just playing notes and tweaking the bend up and down by very small amounts while you play, can be an amazing way to cheat your way into that magic zone of actually feeling like you've just played exactly what you meant to play. and then that supercharges you into very quickly and genuinely discovering all kinds of relationships/intervals/shapes. maybe because it unearths the pitches just enough from their *absolute* location and then suddenly the relationships come alive and become way more potent. It's kind of like when you're eating a cake and you're not sure whether you're tasting the cake or just tasting the cake's location. then you move the cake 3 inches to the left and try the cake again, suddenly you have a more keen awareness of what the cake tastes like, regardless of its location"

        "answer": "sure it can i suppose you have a choice: Cmaj(b5), and i promise you there is nothing illegal about calling it that. it happens normally in the real world. (and you can still use F# on the staff in the melody if it goes there). Or, if you insist on preserving the \"#4\" aspect in the chord symbol, you can say Cmaj(add#4,no5). Although i guarantee if you use the second choice on a chart and give it to a player, you are much much more likely to get a pause and confused looks on the first runthrough. where as if you use Cmaj(b5) it increases the chances significantly that they will actually play what you wanted, the first time through. Sure, it's nice to adhere to proper scale numbering / good enharmonics when you can, but sooner or later you run into edge cases where you have to submit to F#=Gb. There are many more extreme cases, but this is an important one that seems to hit home for you"

        "answer": "those are 2 different ways of doing it, and i think they are both tied for second best. the real fun starts when you think of the lyrics and music at the exact same time. they mean everything to each other. so if you keep them separate, it will be like more of a long-distance relationship"

        "question": "You said \"when it comes, it's a gift\" and \"it waits until you least expect it\" about music (and humor). I often have this feeling, and I even have good ways to catch the \"seed of the gift\" by writing it down or by recording myself singing/playing, accurately enough to be able to reconstruct it. However, I can reconstruct the music but not the feeling/vibe/enthusiasm and it seems dull afterwards and I give up. It seems that a good solution is to continue no matter what (not expecting to be fed by the \"good feeling\" while working on it), but then i'm afraid that if I work in a \"bored\" state then I will make \"boring\" music. Do you have any thoughts, opinions or whatever about this?",
        "answer": "sometimes yes i think it's a fair idea. as i was saying, music loves to strike unexpectedly. and it seems you're already analyzing whether you should or should not continue if you are not 'feeling it'. So therefore, it becomes a good idea to continue anyway, because, again, that increases the likelihood that you will forget how hard you're trying"
