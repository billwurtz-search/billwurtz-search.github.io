        "answer": "it's no 'harder' than hearing english words when people are talking. it's actually quite impossible, but once you develop the ability it's effortless. what it takes is, just a long time of being exposed to the language (or music) with transcriptions to go along with it. and over a very very long period of exposure, eventually out of sheer curiosity you will get around to learning, forgetting, and re-learning, pretty much every different thing that ever happens. for each thing, (chord, word, pattern, thing that happens, whatever) i'd say on average it will take about 10 times learning/forgetting/re-learning the thing, and then you'll know it permanently. that being said, it's not definable how many 'things' there are, or what constitutes a 'thing', nor is it important for you to even know. but this process of learning still works like clockwork nonetheless, automatically, with enough exposure"

        "answer": "basically what you need here, is to dive head first into figuring out what really matters to you in the world, besides music. then incorporate that into music in a way that absolutely resonates with you genuinely. I too, spent most of my younger years wrapped up in only music (music music). so when it came to this point, what i did was, among other things, started freestyling text on a qwerty keyboard, from the abstract to the concrete, trying to really dig down to what means the most to me, and how i can genuinely find what i want to find, through language. after a couple of years of this, i felt more equipped with things to say and make music about, when i returned to songwriting. and i was pleasantly surprised that i was now doing it a lot differently from other songwriters, thanks to all that heck-the-out-tripping experience i'd had"

        "question": "The ending of la de da de da de da de day oh is very strange and one of my favorite parts of the song. The rest was fun to transcribe and I feel it taught me a lot. But the ending feels like the song turned upside down. The song abandons any sort of recognizably melody or harmony except for the quick chords on \"oh no\" and even those seem to have no relation to the key of G (in fact it even sounds like they purposely clash with it), on top of the the lyrics seems to contradict some of what you said in the song. Why did you choose such a sudden and backwards ending? And if possible could tell me what the chords on \"oh no\" are and why you chose them. They're the only part of the song I'm not totally sure I transcribed correctly. I love the ending so much and I want to understand it more.",
        "answer": "that's true all true also true being in a song, and being out of a song, are 2 drastically different worlds. regardless of whether a song has a shocking ending, it's still a very shocking transition to go from listening to a song to not listening to a song. so it often feels appropriate to incorporate elements of this shocking transition, into the song itself. for example: a door usually looks much different from the space in the room it's this in that case, that's exactly the reason i made it that way. if you've ever done something that someone else loves, i'm sure you know this feeling precisely"

The point is not to memorize that specific podcast. you probably won't be reciting an entire podcast episode. the point is to learn to speak. so in your case, likely, the point is to learn how to play drums. not to recite what someone else exactly did one time on a song. the experience you've had in studying the part you studied, you get to keep that experience and take it with you. keeping it fresh is actually good for your learning because you will be having fun and therefore keep doing it more"

        "question": "i want to make fun songs, but whenever i try they don't come out the way i want them to. so the only songs i make that i'm proud of are boring ambient ones, often with no percussion. i tell myself that's probably because i'm just bad at percussion, but looking back on some attempts i've done with percussion included, i feel like it's actually pretty decent, and it's mostly... everything else that's bad. which is strange to me because the songs i make that i like are the ones where the \"everything else\" is all there is. how do i fix this problem?",
        "answer": "if you want to make fun songs, you must actually have fun making it. but it's so easy to forget this"

        "question": "You know how in english (or at least american english, maybe there's different ones in other english speaking countries) there's those filler words like \"uh\" or \"um\" or \"so\" or \"like\", etc. What are some of the filler words you'd hear in dutch?",
        "answer": "you have uh/um. (those are pretty universal). you have \"nou,\", which is sometimes like the english \"now,\" (when it doesn't mean \"time\"). sometimes \"nou\" is slightly more contradictory, like \"well,\" in english. you have \"dus\" which is sort of like \"so\" but also like \"thus\" (which english doesn't use anymore). you have \"soort van\" which is literally \"sort of\", ... you have \"eigenlijk\" which is usually similar to \"actually\", you have \"gewoon\" which often is similar to \"just\", although it often appears in a different word order. you also have \"even\" (sounds like \"effe\"), which is a lot like \"just\" when it means \"real quick\". you have \"zeg maar\" (literally \"say but\") which means \"so to speak\", but maybe better aligns with english \"i guess\" added after something, for approximation. you have \"een beetje\" which is literallly \"a bit\", similar to british usage. you have \"ik bedoel\", literally \"i mean\", identical to english usage, and you have \"denk ik\" which means \"i think\" when added to the end of a phrase. you have \"weet je?\" literally \"y'know\". you have \"natuurlijk\" which is used like english \"of course\". and most of all you have \"nou ja\" or \"naja\", which often means something like \"i mean yeah\", or \"well yeah,\". And then, you have \"lekker\" which means tasty (or \"tastily\"), but it's somehow a filler word for almost all situations, whether it's something you enjoy actually or sarcastically"

        "question": "How crucial do you think real time practice is for learning an instrument? It seems apparent that music came to you pretty naturally so maybe you haven't experienced this. I've been making music in a DAW for a really long time, but I had sensory issues that didn't allow me to learn to play a physical instrument. I'm finding that I've hit a kind of block in my development of skills and understanding, like I've gone as far as I can with only messing around in a piano roll or writing notation. I've largely gotten over my sensory issues now, but I'm still struggling to stay focused long enough to devote the time necessary to learning an instrument. Do you think it's important for my development as a musician to try and defeat my adhd and physically play/improvise/experiment on a real instrument? Does this inspire your brain to generate any advice or words of encouragement? Not that you have any obligation to provide it, I just think you're pretty wise.",

        "answer": "first of all, i have more than 2 answers that recur from time to time. over the years with hundreds of thousands of questions, you're going to get that. \"i would prefer to make a new one to be my favorite\" is my honest answer to anything that asks me to choose a favorite amongst my own songs or videos. i resent the fact that you'd accuse me of being dishonest in that regard. the other one you mentioned, \"i was going to say no but now that i think about it yes\", is quite often an honest answer. again, i can't think of any reason you'd assume that's dishonest. This is usually the answer i give when i wouldn't have originally thought 'yes', but then after thinking about it for a moment, i realize, for the first time, that i do actually agree with the idea posed in the question. which in most cases would be something new to me at that moment. A small percentage of the use-cases for that answer are also because i just think that answer fits well with the question. sometimes it leaves room for the reader to think about it a little more, considering the implications of both a 'no' and a 'yes' answer, and the transition from one to the other. i find that answer to have a lot of different nuances depending on the question, so that's why i think i get so much mileage out of it"

The the bass just goes off for the last 10 seconds and i can't exactly tell what it's doing, except i hear it hit a D# and maybe outline a C fully diminished to resolve to the A/E, but the notes don't sound totally articulated or totally portamento'd.

        "question": "Does a chord need to have all the in-between notes to be called a particular extended chord? Or just the top 2 or 3? For example, say the voicing is C G Bb Eb F. Would that be a Cm11? Or would it be a Cm7add11? Or rather an Ebadd9/G/C :) Or maybe a better example is C Bb Eb A. That sounds very 13'y to me but it doesn't have the 5 or the 9. Would that still be called a 13 then? I guess the contrapositive here might also be interesting: If a chord looks exactly like a stack of thirds, is it possible for it to not be an extension? Like stacking thirds diatonically from C up to A, is that always a C13, or could it be a Bbmaj7/Cmaj? What would have to be happening musically for it to be called a polychord? Does it just have to not resolve to F? But in the blues the four seven doesn't go a fourth up, it goes a fourth down, and it doesn't even sound like a resolution, but everyone calls it an F7 or a Bb7 or whatever.",
        "answer": "sure that might be unnecessary that way might not be clear to anybody actually i'd say that's a pretty typical \"Cm13\", as used in real life. to include the other notes might get too crowded anyway Cm13, according to the notation conventions that i believe are still largely in play, in the professional music world, pretty much means that it includes precisely the notes you first mentioned (C, Bb, Eb, A) and this exact order you mentioned them is in fact seemingly the most useful and common, mostly i almost wanna say you're not gonna find that in real life. the only place you might find it is in a textbook, and even so, that would be a textbook that cares more about what it looks like on paper than how it actually sounds in, like, ... music and songs and stuff i'm not sure what key we're in, compared to the C, but, giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming it is the key of F, thus being C E G Bb D F A, ...... the F note in there is really ruining things, being the reason you wouldn't call it C13, and also the being the main reason you're probably not gonna hear anyone use it like this. get rid of the F, then i guess you'd call it C13. but that's really, really, not the way C13 is actually played by anyone. this thing you're doing with note-stacking-in-3rds, it may relate vaguely to the logic of the notation, but it's just not the way those chords are ever played. you find this immediately when you sort of step out into the real world. The C13 chord symbol, as it's actually used, is generally understood to have the following features: C in the bass, A somewhere in the harmony, Bb somewhere in the harmony, E somewhere in the harmony. then, less important, D is sometimes thrown in for support, and the G honestly usually just crowds things i think the thing on the right side of the slash is understood to be just a bass note. so if you write a whole chord like that, on the right side of the slash, most professionals might not know what to do i'm not sure. i've never heard the word 'polychord' outside of extremely academic scenarios at this point, i think the best thing to do is exit the textbook and get straight into real songs, real music, and see what's going on. at first, a lot of things will surprise you -- you will find many 'rules' from your textbooks to be 'broken' in what you hear, but then you'll find just as many cool patterns that seem to hold true out there in the real music, (which you never saw in the text books), only for those to be broken again in other alternate sides of the music world. music is full of patterns to find, things that happen a certain way, but they are just as quickly defied when you move to a different region, different artist, different sort of music or different time period. have fun (it's fun)"

        "question": "How do I learn to write songs as someone who cringes at their own poor songwriting and can't finish a song because of it? People are so clever and insightful and cohesive and can use symbolism and metaphors in such tasteful way and can tie that all to make a great song that connects with the listener emotionally and makes them think.",
        "answer": "the positive points you mentioned about other people's songs sound like an english essay. but what i find is, all the best music i've heard are not describable like that. they're better. I think if you try to write a song according to the criteria you listed, that's not gonna go well. i'd say the first thing to do is throw out that criteria. there's way way way way way more fun to be had, and no one knows how to do it any better than you. actually no one knows how to do it. that's why we have to resort to music, which is absolute voodoo magic and no one truly knows what it actually does"

        "answer": "you can start it in a lot of different ways -- which actually means, the most important thing is that you do not have to work on the rest of it at that same time. instead, start a bunch of songs, in a bunch of different ways, in one session. remove the pressure of having to switch jobs entirely (from song starter to song finisher), and you'll get a chance to really try a whole bunch of different start-methods and start-tricks -- even try each one of them like 10 times. just make a whole pile. if even just 30% of them are good, that's gonna be a LOT of starting seeds, which your songwriting/songworking depertment will be very very pleased about later. and don't forget to log the ones that come to you by accident when you weren't even trying to do it. feeds the songworking department just the same. again, remember that you are not supposed to drop everything and go to work in the song-working department as soon as you accidentally get a good songseed start, in the middle of your trainride or whatever else. the system is working great if you just log it and continue your life. the songworking department will receive these seeds in due turn, just the same. anyway, that's how i do it"

People should be asking whether the audience should be separate from the art. I think they should. What do you think?",
        "answer": "this question doesn't make much sense on a surface level, but those phrasings tend to, bizarrely, mean something like this: \"If an artist does or thinks something we think is bad, should we turn against them as a society? and if so, how much?\" and my answer is no i don't think society should turn against them. i apologize if this does not resemble your original question. just in case, i will answer your original question more directly, by saying that i think an artist will probably be connected to the art while making it, and then they can make a decision whether to release it with their name on it or anonymously. an audience can also choose to remain separate from any piece of art, by simply not viewing it and not going near it"

        "question": "are there any songs where you wrote only lyrics first, instead of writing the lyrics with some instrument in tandem? if so, can you provide some examples of which songs (that you've posted) you did it with? and do you think writing lyrics before anything else affected the strong-ness of the song",
        "answer": "i've never done lyrics-first for more than one line (such as the title line). Lyrics first for an entire song can be a fun puzzle, and if you want to hear viable results of this, just listen to any Elton John song. but this method just doesn't work for me. However, what can be fun, is to dream up a title for a song. particularly something fairly long, where the title itself is fun to read. Then i'll take this line, musicalize it, and then continue writing the song from there. so only that one line was lyrics first. this is the only time where i'll use lyrics first, is only for a title line. Examples of this are \"i like to wear soft clothing (cuz it makes me feel like i'm rough in comparison)\", \"the moon is made of cheese (but i can't taste it)\", \"ground plane\", \"the best thing about games is losing them\", \"i'm a huge gamer (most of the time)\", and \"the easter bunny told me that christmas isn't real (but santa claus is still jesus)\""

The list will be quite long of course, but you will actually be pleased to find out that there are actually some things that don't fascinate you. those things won't make the list. (it will feel refreshing actually, to have sharpened your sense of who you are, just that little bit). Now, with this tremendously exciting list (still very long), go ahead and start trying to learn them all at the same time, (rotating to the next one as often as desired). this will actually be quite fun for a while, because you will actually learn things. continue this way as long as desired, until you naturally develop a genuine first-hand eagerness to make much more rapid progress on one of them. this decision will come natural and confidently after knowing you've surely and earnestly made an attempt at the longer list"

Actually the real reason i like this clip is just because i get extremely excited whenever i see someone move to a different chair than what the producers had originally expected"

I will say I hit that wall in writing today and tried that idea of making it bad on purpose, and it literally completely worked and propelled the whole thing forward into the right direction. I think the idea works because fundamentally good songs play, like play around, and trying something bad to throw a wrench in the whole thing is sometimes the right chaos and the order / clean up that follows feels so good.

        "answer": "qualitatively there's nothing special about english. but lingua francas aren't usually determined by their qualities. it's just whatever language is already most widely spoken, and then it snowballs because more people want to learn it because more people speak it. the reason it originally became so widely spoken might have something to do with britain and then later usa going around the world and introducing themselves so emphatically"

        "question": "Hey, my question basically could be summarized as \"how did you develop yourself as a musician?\" (out of curiosity), and also, maybe, \"how do you 'understand/(feel about)' music?\", but unsure about that last one. Also, sorry if I ask too much and feel free to omit [not answer everything]. Relatively recently, I got more curious than I've ever been about music. And I found on the internet that you're self-taught and (from what I understand) that you don't really like music theory, and say that music can't really be described like that [sorry if I oversimplfy or misunderstand some stuff]. Which sounds kinda like the approach I would want to take to understand music better and/or maybe even write some of my own music later on. I think what sparkled my curiosity in music, was that some particular songs made me feel specific feelings, some songs being especially intense in that (a large amount of feeling ignited) [How did you get into music? (curiosity)]. So, that made me curious why those songs in particular and how do they make me feel such intense feelings [Do you have songs that made you experience similar things? Do you have the means (what sort of means? how did you get those means?) to explain that, or did you just accept the feelings without questioning them? (Other?)]. It seems to me that the two most important things in a song to me are \"feeling\" and \"story\". \"Story\" isn't necessarily lyrics; it could be fully instrumental song, it just may feel like the melody is still telling a story. And \"feeling\" is 'simply' the fact that melody evokes particular feelings. So, if I were to compose music, I feel like I would want to have these 2 [Do you have \"similar\" ideas about music, that you possibly apply to composing your own pieces of music?] The problem is that I know like nothing about music, and when I'm behind the keyboard I basically can do only hit random keys, and actually they sometimes provide some melodies(, etc) that sound somewhat adequate, and I actually made one into somewhat of a song. So, while this random hitting could provide some ideas, and maybe it is the way to discover music vocabulary, I am completely clueless as to how to transfer the feeling and the story with some sort of intent. And maybe my story/feeling idea isn't even the right approach to making music after all. [How did you start to compose music, and how did that change over time?] And finally, while I am at it (at asking bajilion questions): 1. How did you learn to sing while being self-taught? I would be curious to learn how to sing (at least a bit, for the sake of understanding music), but this one feels by far the scariest, as to not pick up bad habits, improper techniques, and not injure throat. 2. How did you develop your \"ear\"? In particular, how was the \"the high class stuff\" video made? The transcription of pitches of the speaking voice and the insane rhythms in it (weird rests (\"offbeat\"?), weird durations, triplets, quintuplets). This text is so large so that I have to thank you just for reading it, and also thanks for answering on top of that.",
        "answer": "music is an irresistibly strong magical power. it's a no brainer for me to develop that to the best of my ability. the first time i got hooked on it was certainly too early in my life to recall. it was before i learned to speak you can spend many lifetimes trying to explain exactly how this stuff works. i've certainly given it an earnest try from time to time. and as far as i know, no one really knows. although i'm sure someone will try to tell you they know from all the years of trying to 'understand' 'why' this stuff works, or what's really going on, a few basic principles tend to keep emerging. one theme is \"making patterns, and then breaking them\", which of course can be applied recursively as the make-break becomes its own pattern which in turn can be broken. And another strong theme that comes up is the idea that you have to prove you're really there right but as soon as the sound comes out you realize it's not random at all i think with enough time and experience it's gonna work fine. like learning a language, it may take years, but inevitably you will get there if you just find a way to keep enjoying it and being curious at a certain point you start to notice that you come up with ideas when you're not trying to, or when you're not supposed to. and then when you really try to, you clam up. gradually you start to learn how to strategically get that all sorted out, but it's taken me years upon years upon years upon years. maybe the first time i really wrote anything was like 6 or 7 years after i was first introduced to music, but then it was many many many many years later before i had anything with words in it, and then a few more heaps of years more before i did anything you've ever heard from me, surely just doing it a lot, it usually gets better the more you do it. at some point i heard some hints about how to not hurt yourself, but most of the technical desctiptions of how to breathe and use this and that muscle and whatever, didn't make any sense to me. i've had far more success thinking of it in terms of acting. thinking of it as a form of communication i'm not sure, but it occurs to me to ask you how you think you learned how to write and spell so well, in english. whatever mechanism that is, it's pretty much the same thing. and it also takes a lot of time probably"

        "question": "Sometimes I think that it is unnessecary for me to know the distinction between turtles and tortoises. Why can't I just think that they are all turtles? Like, only people who work with animals oughtto know that tortoises are different, since that's important for them. Butthen I realise that there's probably wayyy more comlicated and nuanced differences and facts about turles and tortoises and animals that they know and I don't, so I actually know a normal amount. And then I wonder why I'm soobsessed with limiting my own knowledge. Surely that can't be healthy, noropen-minded, and I should cherish that I know turtles and tortoises are different, yes? But then, what is the ignificance of the cognitive distinction, if it is likely that I will never need to pick one out of a crowd of the other? Although, it's unlikely that a shark is heading straight for me, but it would help to know how to stop it from getting me. Should I relax on the whole knowledge thing, or is there really no reason in seperating turtles and tortoises in my mind?",
        "answer": "you can. everything has to be approximated somewhere. do you realize how different some houses are from other houses, and yet the word house remains surprisingly useful if you leave the turtle thing aside, this will only bring opportunities to learn other things that are more important to you. you're not obsessed with limiting your knowledge, but what you do have is a lot of analytical energy, to the point where you're on the verge of trying to open your mind in multiple ways at once, some of which may be contradictory to each other there are equal joys to be had at every level of tortoise/turtle awareness spectrum you may not need to, but what if you WANT to you don't have to. i think your best bet at this point is to pursue your curiosities. the brain is maybe at its most powerful when it's curious. so you can't go wrong there to put it in perspective, in some regions, the word for \"soda\" is \"coke\". so therefore Coke and Pepsi would both be considered different kinds of coke"

There's talk out there about right brain being more about symbols and meaning and the left brain being more about words and logic. You've talked in interviews about breaking down all the barriers in your mind (conscious vs. unconscious, etc.), would you say this helps with your happiness and your pursuit of doing what's meaningful to you? Some psychologists think if the right brain is quieted too much (too much focus on words, facts etc.) things get gray and we get stuck and unhappy because nothing has meaning. Maybe part of living a meaningful life is focusing on symbolism and beauty the same that we focus on facts, and maybe that means listening to the right brain more, based on modern neuroscience stuff. Simply a thought",

        "question": "Hi Bill, I hope to find you well in these trying times for the world. Just recently I rediscovered your music after learning almost all of it by memory years ago, and remembering about this questions section on your website I wanted to drop by to say I love your music. As an electronic music student, I can't help but be amazed at the intricacy of your compositions. You manage to use harmony, groove and timbre as tools to craft relatable vibes, along with lyrics that - a way to put it for me is that they reveal a certain depth of character and life experience, also relatable, and something one could learn and take inspiration from as a person. All this said, I look forward to dive into new music of yours in the future! Hope you're having a good time, and take good rest on summer vacations! I hope you're on a summer vacation, you truly deserve it.",

        "question": "Hi Bill. I've been thinking about this topic for a few years now and I'm wondering if you have some more insight into it and experience with this same thought pattern... and hopefully some sort of an swer or solution that can help me out. I'm in sort of a thou ght loop to do with productivity, goals, and doing the things I WANT to be doing, but find myself NOT doing. For example, I'm a musician as well and I want to be writing more music and practicing piano more. I'm also a drumme r and keep up with that because I'm currently in a band, which is something holding me to improving and being creative... all that. The problem is, I have nothing holding me to writing songs in any particular time frame, or m aking me practice piano, practice singing... etc. I have FLStudio and want to put some more time into learning the platform, but I'm struggling a lot with the learning curve of even starting out and making something simple. Basically what my question boils down to is this: how do I get myself to do the delayed gratification things I WANT to be working t owards and improving at when all I seem to want to do is quick dopamine rel ease like watching YouTube and playing video games? I'm in a weird spot on my thoughts about it because part of me thinks \"I have my whole life to wri te music, make an album I'm proud of, (insert long term goal), etc... so ea ch day it seems almost pointless to start, and very difficult to find the m otivation to do it and enjoy doing it. Should I wait until the days I decid e I feel like working on something and very slowly work towards my goals, o r set more attainable short-term goals to keep me on track? I've tried both and I still feel like I could be making more progress... I feel like I'm g onna end up 45 years old and still not comfortable and capable on piano and all that and still struggling to write anything, wishing I used the hours of free time I had when I was younger... I know this is a fucking essay at this point but, thoughts on all that? Have you found your self thinking similar things? Is it really enough to just very slowly work towards it when I feel the motivation? Thanks.",

It happens so often over the years that it's developed into a distrust of myself. Any advice? Solidarity?",
        "answer": "i am guessing this will work for you: start cultivating a continuous list of ideas. the more the better. what you'll find is, the coolest thing about ideas is that you never know which one is going to turn out which way. so it's actually fun to pepper an idea list with quite 'bad' or 'useless' ideas. you never know which ones are the winners anyway. but the real important thing here is you need to take the pressure off the individual idea. the list method is probably a great cure for that"

I had always understood it as a sort of thoughtless creation, like a spilling out of creation without premeditation or intent.",
        "answer": "you left out the context. that was in the context of someone asking me whether i think i am a 'surrealist'. so the answer i gave was in relation to the work that i do i was thinking surrealism is something that really doesn't resemble anything that can be described in words. so i think what i was trying to say is, it's good to have more recognizable elements as anchors, and surrealism works perfectly well but if the whole thing is completely unidentifiable then you might feel a little lost. but it's important to remember that i did not bring up the word surrealism in this situation. so all of my analyses here are somewhat on the back foot, as i'm trying to incorporate the word (surrealist) originally suggested in the question, which might not be a word i would have chosen to use for anything"

Was this break from speaking intentional? Does it represent something, because I find it intruiging. maybe its just a place to relax?",
        "answer": "was that question intentional if it intruigues you, that alone is worth it. but the way these things work usually is i try to figure out how i want it to go. and then hopefully i find a way that i'd like it to go. For example, some people decorate their office with plants. but there are some parts of the office without plants. usually the reason is related to how they want the office to be"

Do you think writing an actual ending is typically the stronger way to end a song? Actually as I'm writing this I just realized that Mt. St. Helens ends in a fade (I think?). But I can't think of any others. I feel like a fade out could be a useful tool when you want to imply that the music could go on forever, but sometimes when I hear fade outs in songs it almost just sounds like the band is still playing and the producer just decided \"this is getting too long, I'm just gonna fade it out here to shorten the run time\".",

        "question": "What if a lot of the things that people blame on capitalism was actually feudalism's fault all along? For example, occupational surnames seem to imply that you are your job, but they date back to the Middle Ages. Meanwhile, due to the Industrial Revolution making labor more efficient, people have more free time, and they get to have a \"work-life balance\" with \"hobbies\". Not everyone works on a farm because not everyone needs to work on a farm. People aren't separated into castes like lords, vassals, and peasants; they can change how much money they earn. Don't get me wrong; the poor get poorer and never any richer, and you are not the car you drive or the contents of your wallet and all that. But I think some clarity on the issue of capitalism is much needed. Thoughts?",
        "answer": "the hypnotic quality of the word capitalism is that i seem to understand less and less what it means, each time the word is used"

        "question": "As I write more songs, I'm finding it's really easy for me to write choruses and bridges the repetitive or most important parts of the song that reveal the core way that I feel about something. These are usually the things I write first, the first things I come up with. As I then have to expand on those ideas, I find it's difficult to put together verses or pre-choruses. I feel like I'm out of things to say. I think part of the problem is that these are usually the parts of other peoeple's songs I find least interesting. Like, my favorite \"musical moments\" are often choruses or bridges, and I don't usually think about verses. Ofcourse there are great lyrical moments that I think about all the time, but those are few and far between I suppose. It's like, I just wrote the best part of this song, and now you want me to... write a less interesting part? I don't know how to expand on my ideas in that way. Does that make sense? What do I do?",
        "answer": "the first thing i'd absolutely recommend to any songwriter, forget everything you know about the names of the sections. \"chorus\", \"verse\", these terms play dirty and no one truly knows which is which, or if songs even need to have them, whatever. The important thing is, you've come up with the most important part, the best part. so you know you have that to offer. make the rest of the song about how good the main part is, and how excited you are to have people hear it. remember this 'additional contents' can be as short as you want, it can be after or before, in between, anywhere, and it does not have to be called a 'verse' or 'pre-whatever'. any amount of anything anywhere, in service of the main gift piece you are offering. in fact it's always good to first just ask yourself if maybe you don't even need anything else. and then just do whatever you need to deliver the goods. it's like you've got the birthday gift, all you need is the box. just put it in something and get it there, so it can be opened and enjoyed"

        "question": "This may be a dumb question (as in there may be a glaringly obvious answer that I'm overlooking)... but is there a way to calculate the square root of a number without having a calculator or other device with a square root button? Like, how would you figure out the square root of a number using only +,-,\u00d7, and/or \u00f7?",
        "answer": "what i would do, for example, to find the square root of 7, is guess and check and keep narrowing the window. 2 squared is 4, and 3 squared is 9. so it's between 2 and 3. multiply by 100 to make it easier. 20 squared is 400, 30 squared is 900. so the square root of 700 is between 20 and 30. .....25 squared is 625...... so it's more than 25. ... 26 squared is 676. ....the difference between those last 2 results is 51, so i know it's gonna be 53 up to the next (27 squared = 729). ok so it seems like 26.5 is gonna be pretty close to the square root of 700. add more digits and say what's 265 squared, i mean that's a little heavy perhaps to do in your head, but you said you're allowed to use \"+,-,\u00d7, and/or \u00f7\", so, 265 squared is ... (260x260 + 5x5 + 260x5x2) which is (67600 + 25 + 2600) which is 70225. so that's...... fairly close. this means 2.65 squared is 7.0225. maybe we can check 264 squared -- just take the previous result and subtract 264 and 265. so 70225 minus 529 is 69696. so that means 2.64 squared is 6.9696. it looks like the answer is about half way in between the two previous results. so 2.645 is getting closer still. if you want to keep narrowing it down, you'd have to add more digits, and check 2645 squared, and see which side of 7000000 it's on, then check the one on the other side, and do the same thing again. but we've got it down to approximately 2.645, without a calculator"

I'm thinking classical symphonies but it could be jazz improvs etc. Do you follow along with the sheet music if it exists? Do you try to focus on non-melody parts like the bass and inner harmonies as a challenge? Do you visualize the melodies as notes of a piano roll? Do you try to imagine movie scenes that could go along with the music? Do you make yourself feel as if what you are about to hear is heavenly, so that you are positively predisposed? Do you channel your inner Leonard Bernstein and air-conduct an imaginary symphony orchestra in your bedroom? Basically the question is, how to hang from the first note and keep flying till the last note (paraphrasing Daniel Barenboim here), so that I can thorougly enjoy a piece of music and make my brain shut up and listen?",

        "answer": "some artists 'cater' to the audience more, or less, than others. for me, the way it works is this: as soon as i turn on even 1 nanogram of cater, the whole thing shuts down. doesn't work. my hands don't move, i can't function. so.... for me the zero-cater policy is about the same as the zero turpentine policy that you'll find in most modern brands of milk."

(I found it to be toxic and although I am quite good I grew to hate the tedious practicing) In the last month ive discovered a passion for creating music. It's always been there, but now is not blocked by stress for the need to practice classical. i hear all these jazz and funky music ideas in my head. but when i go to play them my muscle memory in my hands just reverts to a classical style. I feel like I know too much theory and practiced so much in this specific style i can't actually play whats in my head. can you please help or offer advice?",

Do you just try random words until it works? no. it's almost like some kind of intuitive lightning bolt that magically reveals the words to you. probably neither of us really knows how that works. but it's your imagination, and it works the same way with music. the more experience you have with the words (notes) and what they sound like (and mean), the better you'll be able to do it"

Later, i got a voice mail message from that same teacher, the message was for 'bill' and she was saying that i still hadn't turned in that project, and if i didn't then i wasn't going to pass the class. of course i knew that i actually HAD turned in the project. so her message made perfect sense except for that one detail. And here's why: there was another student named Bill, in another one of her classes, who was in the same situation, who hadn't finished that same project, would have not passed if he didn't complete it, and his phone number was almost the same as mine, and she dialed my number by mistake. so she dialed the wrong number (mine) and delivered a voice mail message to someone (me) who had the same name and was almost in the exact same situation as the other person who's number she meant to dial"

        "question": "why do people associate \"wanting to live a simple and peaceful life somewhere far far away from urban rigour\" with retiring so much?? it drives me mad and perpetuates the self-doubt i experience while i think about these thoughts (whose effects extends both ways). I dont know if im being misinformed and am seeing things through rose-coloured lenses but realistically (this MIGHT change) i cannot really see myself living in city life unless something interesting happens to my internal sense of meaning that makes me entirely change my mind, which may certainly happen judging by the rate at which certain things in life are driving me insane. to the best of my knowledge i belive you live in a city so bonus question how do you survive (if you do survive) in such a hectic style of living. alright thanks",
        "answer": "there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages to both. living in the city can be very validating. it can remind you that you have a healthy ability to be normal and do normal things like a normal person. i guess not everyone needs that reminder. but i think if i lived in the middle of nowhere, i'd start to become too insecure that i actually am not even fit to live on this planet"

        "question": "trying to figure this out. i always have to learn so many songs for the many performances i play on a weekly basis (church, various groups out in the various venues etc) how should i balance learning songs for performances and writing music? I find that I am most productive creatively during long periods of no obligations, but even during these periods of time lately the stuff i gotta learn looms in the background of my vibe. sometimes i abandon practicing and learning songs and rely on my ear and improvisational abilities, which nobody seems to complain about, but personally it hurts my soul to not know the song deeply",

        "question": "Does the circle of 5ths serve a purpose other than being a tool to help people memorize what notes are sharp/flat in a key signature? I got comfortable playing in all 12 keys and knowing the sharps/flats before I ever even saw/knew about that circle of 5ths graphic. I guess it visually shows the relationships between different key sigs (which is cool), but not sure if I understand the practical use of it when it comes to actually playing music? I think if you want to learn how to play in a certain key, you kind of need to build up that muscle memory of what it 'feels like' for your hands to be playing in that key. Knowing that A major has a C#, F# and G# doesn't mean you can just freely/easily play in A major on the spot (if you're not already comfortable playing in that key). I guess the circle helps you quickly figure out what notes are in the key, but I can only see that being helpful in a practice situation... And if you're just practicing, you can just, like... look up the notes of the scale on the internet...",
        "answer": "it's a tool to make your keyboard not sound like crap. but the work has already been done. you don't need to worry about it. your keyboard is already tuned to 12-tone-equal-tempered (which is what makes the keys all wrap around neatly like that), so the work has already been done. enjoy your keyboard sounding like not-crap in every key the graphic is just telling about a cool pattern. it's something you'd probably notice by yourself anyway if no one had told you. it's like when someone tells you the last digit of multiples of 9 gets one lower each time. neat. the numbers still work fine regardless of whether you know about that, or whether or not you think it's neat wait a minute, forgive me for asking this, but, .......... is your keyboard muted or something?"

        "question": "I'm autistic, but I have a not autistic friend and they told me that you do not always answer in a straight forward way in your answers. Sometimes you say the opposite of the answer you really mean. I would ask if this is true, but I would have no idea if the answer you give is the true or the opposite of what is true. Apparently people don't always just say direct answers to questions and I don't understand why. Apparently that is autism, but it seems more to me like everyone else is the weird one for not just answering questions directly. And if everyone else knows that you can never know if someone is answering a question directly and honestly, how does anyone function?",
        "answer": "perhaps the problem is that total complete honesty would take an infinite amount of time to express. to answer finitely, requires an absurd amount of simplifation, and the answerer may have to make some big decisions about how to go about doing that. in some cases it may turn out that stronger meaning can be approximated better by going at sort of an oblique angle from the question, especially if there are other important issues that weren't even covered in the question. For example, let's say there is a Tsunami approaching. your friend asks you \"what's 2 plus 2\". and instead of saying \"4\", you answer \"aaaaah there's a Tsunami approaching\""

Like right now I'm pissed about things that have happened to me, and I realize that there are other people with much worse circumstances, but that only makes me hate the world more. Funnily enough, most the people with worse circumstances in the world believe in a loving god and that everything's gonna be alright, but I just can't believe that. For example there's no way it's the proper meaningful way of the world for some dude to be pushed in front of a subway train and killed, yet this happens multiple times a year. Like I know all this is still true and yet I don't care about it in better points in my life, but now that I'm in a low point I need to figure out how to stop hating the world so much as it's just making me grumpy and unproductive. Previously I was thinking I could use this anger to live a good life just to show the world it can't beat me, but I know this is meaningless as the world doesn't actually give a shit, so it seems I gotta just not hate it instead.",

Maybe some chairs are just too shy to talk about it and prefer to stay quiet so they don't offend anyone.

Writers, on the other hand, love writing so much that they're just going to keep writing no matter what. but regardless, there's infinite things to say anyway, so you're gonna end up saying things no matter what. if you try to avoid writing because you think there's nothing to say, then you'll never even get a chance to improve, and then you'll have to try to tell other writers not to write either, to prevent them from getting ahead of you"

The second reason is because the dot on the i can be seen like an eye, giving it a more personal feel. in addition to these reasons NOT to capitalize that particular word, i also have no idea what good it does to capitalize it, and other languages don't do it either. of all the pronouns, it's kind of hilarious that we choose that one to capitalize"

        "answer": "if you learn the note names based on absolute pitch in early life, i think that might actually hurt your music. music is all in the relationships between the notes. finding the absolute is just a party trick i learned later in life, which has a limited number of random professional benefits. to compare it to cooking, absolute pitch would be like memorizing the UPC codes of all your ingredients, where as relational pitch would mean you can taste what they actually do. i myself was actually surprised to find out how truly unmusical the absolute pitch is. which is also what makes it so confusing that the phrase 'perfect pitch' is something that sounds like it means your pitch is perfect, but it neither means that nor is musical"

        "question": "I saw this form of musical notation in a question asked to you on August 14, 2018: \"3/4 3..45./2...../1..23./lo7...../lo6.lo7.1./lo5...3./4..321/2...../ 3..45./2...../1..23./lo7...3./4.3.1./1...lo7./1.1235/8.1.../\"; you mentioned in your answer that this is a form of notation you use as well when you only have access to text to write music. It looks interesting and efficient, but I can't make heads or tails of it. Would you mind explaining this form of notation, to a musician-in-training who's used to standard music notation?",
        "answer": "this person's notation system is very clear to me. they did a good job presenting all the necessary melodic information, specifically the pitch and the rhythm. they are using numbers for scale degrees, so for example in the key of C that would be 1=C, 2=D, etc. They've indicated the rhythm clearly making every note the same length, and using dots do fill equal sized spaces with no notes. The slashes are clearly barlines. thanks to their time-signature hint at the top (3/4) we can assume that each digit or dot represents an eighth note of time. Also very useful is that they are distinguishing notes in different octaves by saying \"lo7\" to represent the 7 below the 1, and so on. So the melody is represented quite clearly and precisely. Information that is NOT included here: chords, tempo, and note duration. However, this particular melody is so strong and familiar the chords are just about totally obvious"

        "question": "Any tips for learning a new language?",
        "answer": "the way i approach a brand new language is this: find some videos of people having real conversations (not scripted) like podcasts or something like that. the more you enjoy the content, the better. but you also need it to have a reliable human-made transcript. then get the transcript translated. then just start getting curious about which sounds mean what, and go from there. listening is king, but the transcript will unlock what you're hearing. a crucial important tip is do NOT expect yourself to 'remember' or 'memorize' anything. that's just not how it works. with more and more and more and more and more exposure, whilst being curious, the brain will do what it does naturally, which is learn. your brain is much better at learning than you will ever understand. trust that this will happen naturally with enough exposure and curiosity. the only other thing that may throw you off is how ridiclulously long it takes"

        "question": "Does it bother you when the music at a place doesn't fit the place's atmosphere? For instance, last night I went to a nice Belgian restaurant. It was rather elegant, with good-quality (if a bit overpriced) food, and a rather elderly clientele. However, they were playing EDM/rave music at full blast in there throughout the whole time we were there, and while it didn't seem to bother everyone else too much, it drove me nuts. I'm not a particular fan of that kind of music, but that's not what bothered me about it-what bothered me was that it didn't match the restaurant's atmosphere and ambiance at all. In fact, it seemed to be a continued disturbance to the atmosphere, and it stuck out like a sore thumb. It was too bad, because I liked the food, and the decoreverything else was enjoyable, except the music. Do things like this ever happen to you? Do you have any advice on how to deal with situations like this (assuming that it wouldn't really be feasible to change the music)?",

        "question": "ok am i crazy or are most of the animations in the video for \"here comes the sun\" rendered out with only 1 sample? (or another very low number of samples) if that's actually the case, why'd you do it that way? are the performance savings from only doing 1 sample that great, or is there something else you're doing to the video? a lot of the lines (on the pixel level) just feel..... oddly jagged, like there's no anti-aliasing going on at all .......actually just looking at the pixels a little closer, and i'm gonna revise my question: am i crazy or is there an extremely extremely subtle amount of edge detection being done across almost every object in the video? i'm actually seeing some anti-aliasing on closer inspection (indicative of a normal number of samples for rendering), but tons of edges are outlined with a thin black line. (if true) i'm curious why you did that for \"here comes the sun\", and also why not any other videos, at least that i've noticed (and if not true, what the heck am i seeing?) i think i've established that i'm definitely crazy, though, so this whole thing is probably a moot point anyways",

You put it back, shake the hat to mix it up, draw agin, it's 17 again. Repeat. By pure chance you draw the number 17 a bunch of times in a row, technically possible right? Here's my question- with each 17 that you draw, do your chances of it being 17 get higher or lower? I know that the technical answer is that the chances get lower, but for some reason I have this weird feeling that the universe would recognize the pattern and your chances might get higher to fulfill it.",
        "answer": "the technical answer is that the chances should always be the same, not lower in a real world situation, it would probably become somewhat likely that some kind of trickery or defect could be happening at this point. so in that sense, there would be a nonzero chance that it is a trick and therefore the trick might continue this way. but if you can be sure you've eliminated any chance of such trickery, then the chances are the same each time"

On the one hand, setting a deadline lets me know how much I need to divide my work over time and lets me know when to stop working, but on the other hand if my work isn't finished before the deadline, it will never be finished because it's past the deadline and i've stopped working on it.",

        "question": "Lately I've been thinking about what causes stalled progress in the creative process. Why excitement for a goal dwindles the closer you get to achieving it. I've noticed the struggle usually occurs when I hit some sort of road block. Almost always when the experience of *doing it* stops being fun. Instead of asking \"how can I push through it?\" I wanted to know what you do to make the process enjoyable again? When I try to coerce it into a desired outcome it only makes it worse. Sorta like it's protesting or arguing with me in some weird way. So how do you invite the play back into it and help things move more freely? Thanks.",
        "answer": "like untangling a cable, ultimately you need to find the end (or start) of the cable. Basically what you need to do is open up a conversation with a friend (or, you know, rubber duck, or maybe just a television camera / yourself) and explain what this project is, for those of us who don't know. like just explain how you got into this whole mess. that will be like finding the end of the cable, suddenly you'll be able to see perfectly clearly what the point of this thing was all along"

        "question": "Hope the holidays are going well for you. Whenever asked about your favorite song (of yours), you answer that you'd rather make a new one to be your favorite. You've said that this is because you believe every song you make has to be made with the mentality that it'll be better than the song that came before it. I wonder, though, by that logic, is the last song you'll make before retirement (if you plan to retire from making music at some point) the best song you'll ever make? Do you think you'd be satisfied with that song enough not to feel the urge to make another better one? If not, then does that mean that you'll probably keep making songs for the rest of your life and, therefore not really retire from music?",
        "answer": "\"i would prefer to make a new one to be my favorite\" says nothing about whether or not it will work. it just means to try. i mean if you aren't treating the one you're working on with favored status, then who's really flying the ship here, yknow"

I want to make great music, but I don't want to sell my happiness for it. Thank you <3",
        "answer": "i'm not sure. as a player, almost all of my life experience has been in non-classical scenarios, which means the individual player has much more freedom over their exact individual behavior. the classical music player's lifestyle is very foreign to me. i do however relate more to the lifestyle of the classical composer"

And if I'm trying to focus on what a specific instrument is playing or something about the music other than the lyrics, then it's as if most of the words don't even register in my head. However, I imagine that most people are not attentively reading the lyrics while they're listening to a song, so I always wonder if I'm just not very good at hearing lyrics or if it's just common to not really pay much attention to the lyrics of a song and try to understand them as if reading a paragraph in a book.",
        "answer": "i would say that just means the song's not good enough"

ALSO: because the 2 halves directly refer to each other, that means the sentence is not complete because there is no grounding. like if you point 2 mirrors directly at each other, you won't see anything unless there are some non-mirror objects somehow involved (such as yourself, to be able to even view it). so inconclusion the sentence is 50% incomplete, and it's 50% likely that each half is the incomplete half, and independently also 50% likely that each half is the true half.

        "question": "I like that thing that happens sometimes in songs where an unfinished lyric is repeated in kind of an unresolved melody, then the lyric finishes climacticly as the melody/harmony resolves. Usually happens with the title line of the song and at the end of the song. A couple examples that come to mind are Jingle Bell Rock (\"That's the jingle bell, that's the jingle bell, that's the jiiiinnnnggleee belllll rooooockkkk!\"). There's also this live version of You Make Me Feel So Young where Sinatra ends it with \"You make me feel so, you make me feeeeel so... Oh, you!... Make me feel, sooooooo..... (crazy horn section line).... yooouuunnnnng!\" I want to come up with a name for this thing? Also, can you think of any more examples?",
        "answer": "you're a little late for that...... the vast majority of all working musicians have been calling this a 'tag', for at least a century in my estimate trillions. for huge parts of the 20th century, it seems like all songs did that. maybe slightly less often nowadays but it still gets used all the time. heck i do it in my own songs. Or any time i'm listening to a song, especially if it might not be from an era or context where you might expect a tag, and then they start doing a tag, i say out loud, to myself or whoever's around, 'taggin it!'"

        "question": "a couple years ago i distinctly remember reading = a response on here that went something along the lines of \"use as few chords as possible when writing a song\" --i've been haunted by this ever since. the more i dig into your music, the more i realize just how much of it is founded on the most rudimentary I's, IV's, and V's, despite all the crazy fills and modulations. when i write, i often find myself getting distracted by the more lush and colorful sound of upper extensions, as well as lots of dramatic chord movements. i've trained my brain to prioritize those kinds of sounds, and it feels like anything else sounds, regrettably, \"plain\". but i feel oftentimes that it undermines my music in the grand scale of things; i'd do ANYTHING to go back in time to before i was so mired in jazz theory. do you have any advice on achieving this sort of \"harmony nirvana\" that you seem to have? it's as if you know perfectly where to place all the surprising and exciting harmonic moments without compromising simplicity. tl;dr: as a theory-obsessed berklee dropout, how can i learn the confidence to use more \"basic\" or \"boring\" chords in my music?",
        "answer": "that's really not something i would say. there may have been some very specific context where that would be appropriate, but it really does not sound like something i would say. various times in my life i have heard people say that kind of thing and it doesn't quite sit well with me. that being said, the opposite doesn't sit well either of course please don't give me credit for that. this is something you either thought of yourself, or heard from someone else (a lot of people say it actually) probably trying to address their concerns that people may be using the opposite strategy, which doesn't really make sense either i think you're looking in the wrong place. in fact, just the order and pattern to which you listed the chords you just listed, gives me a clue that you might be looking in the wrong place for this i find you can't actually prove which part extends from which and when how do you feel about melodies you seem to be walking backwards all the time. all this 'how to not'. sounds like youve got a case of the 'how to nots'. so 'how to not have a case of the how to nots?' well actually i think in your case, hear me out, ........ i think you should try to write the most academically advanced musical composition the world has ever seen. (seen?..... wait no actually yes.) i'm just pursuing what excites me most. i took a random quasi-satirical guess just now at what might excite you, but that might be unfair.... the point is, i see you back-stepping away from anything that might truly thrill you, and then backstepping back away from the alternative because of course it doesn't thrill you enough. Whatever your thrills may be, ....... you must go toward them. or, if it's more thrilling, do a fake-out and go briefly away from them and then slam back toward them, and so on why settle for just scratching the surface..... go for a world record. make the most boring song ever made. heck, you'd be famous immediately if you actually achieved that"

The kind of fun thing about this is to think about this 'what' issue at any time. chew away at 'what exactly is this', you can think about this while you're in bed, when you are waiting in line for the other line you have to wait in, these are the best times to just get curious about exactly what this whole thing is and why it ever was so exciting. everything else becomes such a non-issue compared to the this 'what' question, sorry for repeating myself and sorry also about when i explain it again soon"

        "question": "Do you find it important to have a \"half understanding\" of an art form so you can discover entirely new methods as to creating a piece? I ask this because I have really wanted to compose many pieces of music, but I find myself easily overwhelmed and demotivated. I know how to read music and I myself can play a few instruments. I find myself so immersed into music and I generate melodies and sometimes even whole songs in my head. However, when I try to put it on paper, nothing comes out, which is weird because I can perfectly hear every detail of the music in my head but actually notating it gives me difficulty. This is likely more common than I think, but that's not the main point I want to make. A common thing I tell myself is that \"learning music theory will help me actually make something\" and then at that point I have to wonder; how much theory should I actually know? I don't want to sound like any other artist, neither do I want to be trapped into one genre. Self expression is important in art, and I feel as if an arbitrary concept will hold back at that (especially with something as highly regarded as music \"theory\"). However, I also feel as if being completely clueless about it won't lead to any progress. Is it possible to develop even your own personal theory? I like emailing/asking questions to those I admire, and I thought taking this one to you would especially give me some sort of understanding. Have a great 2025!",
        "answer": "for me the only genuine understanding is the part i arrive at independently by myself probably the majority of musicians nowadays go straight to sound, without having any intermediary silent paper stage. the silent paper thing can be fun, but it's a specific thrill that does not need to be the default way, and probably is only possible if you have sufficient experiencing making audible music it's like taste. how much taste theory do you need to know? wait what the heck is taste theory anyway it's like meeting a new person and falling in love with them. first it's important to buy and read a book that someone else wrote about how to fall in love with that person, in order to do it correctly. no i'm just kidding, this is not the case i personally am unable to understand any theory unless i've come up with it on my own. even if i know someone else may have found exactly the same thing before, it won't make any sense to me until i do it myself. This may be true for anyone, but i find it even more violently true for me than for others. i'm sure it has advantages and disadvantages i was thinking of combining 2025 and 2026 together actually"

        "question": "If light is the only thing that's constant every where in the universe, then why is it so prone to mistakes? Why is light affected by gravity so that we see eg. stars that are behind the sun in a different place than they actually are because of the sun's gravity? Why could we see the back of our head if we looked to the side at the event horizon of a black hole because the light particles orbit around the black hole? The back of my head clearly isn't where the light indicates it to be. The fact that the speed of light is constant makes it seem so divine, but does it have to be so weird then? Also, if you fell inside a black hole, nothing might happen to you for hours and you would see the entire universe compressed into a increasingly smaller circle in your vision, the rest of which is complete darkness. Do you really think the black hole just swallows you \"away\" from the rest of the world or where would you go??? It seems like a place outside of our universe and I'm fascinated and confused because maybe some of my \"why\" questions could still be answered through math. Maybe we lack a dimension in our awareness to understand all this, but yeah I wanted to share my thoughts and confusion",
        "answer": "light doesn't actually indicate where it is. you've just seen so much of it in normal earth circumstances that you've learned to use it to interpret where things are. If you go (or look) to somewhere far into another world with where different circumstances apply, you will have to re-learn how to interpret it i'm not sure, but the answer is usually even more divine than you expected it's hard to fully understand things so far away when we have literally never spent a day off earth"

And IF I end up with enough ideas to finish the song, it always seems like the ideas don't fit together.What should I do? Also, do you write music from beginning to end, or out of order?",
        "answer": "this may seem off the subject, but think about why exactly you want to get songs written it always works better when it's written in the order it actually goes in. However, you can't control what ideas you get, so sometimes you get an idea that belongs in the middle of a song. in that case, your task becomes significantly more bizarre and unnatural, because you have to completely disobey the natural law of cause and effect. can be done but it takes a much weirder miracle than normal forward writing"

        "question": "Do you think there's any way that your school experience (I'm primarily talking about middle and high school here) could have been improved upon so that it would have been more beneficial/enjoyable/fruitful for you? Do you think the curriculum could have been improved upon in any way? If so, how? Do you think subjects could have maybe been taught in a way that would be a bit more compatible with your learning style? Do you think you would have benefitted from special accommodations that would have allowed you to learn in a way more compatible with your own learning style while still being in a school environment? If so, what accommodations do you think you could have benefitted from? Or do you think your learning style was/is just completely incompatible with any kind of school environment? In which case, what recommendation(s) would you have for parents who have a child in a similar situation as you when you were growing up? Sorry for the long question. Hope your 2025 is going well so far.",
        "answer": "school is not necessarily the best place to learn things from the actual curriculum. unless it's seriously some kind of miracle program. learning is only effective when you're deeply inspired and curious. it's hard to reliably prescribe curiosity en masse. sometimes something or someone may cause inspiration, but you never know when that's gonna happen. 'school' however, sort of has a lot of other purposes than just learning things from the curriculum. i mean at least it's an excuse for everyone in town to see each other. people have a lot to learn from each other, regardless of who they are"

        "question": "I once had a dream you befriended a little orange cat who would come and visit you in the darkness of night. You were always very happy to see your tiny visitor and greatly enjoyed her company whenever she decided to stop by. But it very much had the feeling that she would come and go as she pleased without much consideration for your opinion on the matter. Typical feline. So very fickle. You can never make them behave like a dog despite wishing they would. Which reminds me! Later in that same dream you then had a dog named Vinegar! (The name makes me laugh for multiple reasons) Vinegar seemed to be very loyal and quite affectionate, but she also had a bit of a stubborn streak. You'd try to walk her to where you wanted to go and she would just stop dead in her tracks and refuse to move. \"She likes to do this. If I just act like I'm going to leave she'll follow me. She always does.\" But she just laid there, watching you walk off with your head turned around like an owl watching her in return expectantly. Vinegar never did follow in that dream. Ultimately you had to go back for her with a leash in hand before she got up with a wagging tail to greet you.",

        "question": "Have you heard about AQAL / Integral Theory? It is a mental framework that describes phenomena in terms of \"holons,\" which are nested hierarchies. It explains why a lot of phenomenon in the world tend to exhibit similar behaviors, and it explains a lot of phenomenon in the world as things that develop across time. It talks about how some humans just naturally develop into this type of \"holon\"-based, development-based, Integral-based world view. I learned about it and went \"geez this seems very similar to how I view the world currently but is more articulate and thought-out.\" I was wondering if AQAL / Integral Theory resonates at all then with you (obviously I do not know you personally :P).",

        "question": "Many would say \"Art imitates life\", and some would even say \"Life imitates art\". Many also say \"Imitation is the highest form of flattery\"... so does this mean art is very fond of life? Or life is very fond of art? Both? Is this a chicken and egg situation? You can't really have art if you don't have life, but I would argue you can't have life without art. A life without art is barely life at all. So which imitated which first? Did they each imitate each other in tandem? Maybe life and art are even one in the same. Maybe everything is art. Maybe everything is life. Maybe... everything is... stuff. Woah.",

Maybe there's a more creative and exciting way to define what a light bulb could be and what changing it could entail, and maybe there's exciting ways to defy expectations of what changing a light bulb could look like, including changing something that is not a light bulb or doing something with a light bulb that is not changing it.",

        "answer": "now that you mention it, i'm not actually quite so honest when i say \"i always do words+music altogether\" because truthfully i have the same situation as you: i have tons of instrumental riffs and things on hand, they come to me in dreams, etc, and i do indeed use those. \"might quit\", \"meet me in september\", \"corner store\", and many others, are based on a main melody that came to me initially with no words attached. Not always the most pleasant way to work, having to search to the ends of the earth to try to figure out what words belonged there all along, but it can be done. but anyway, you can still also write songs where you do it all together, and then you can mix it up even more by doing it other ways too, like 'title first' is a really fun way to do it; like, 'Sick of having songs with lame titles? what kinds of titles do you wish your songs would have?' and then think of some, and then blam, throw them into a list and then that's a super fun exercise for next time, which is basically 'melodify one of those titles' and then wait until yet a third time to turn that melodified line into the rest. anyway my point is there's lots of different fun methods, and there is no reason to restrict yourself to just one. have a blast"

        "question": "I've been learning piano for a little while now, but up until about 2 years ago, I was almost exclusively studying classical music. However, I've more recently begun studying some (rather simple) jazz standards from the Real Book. Often, I have to practice playing the right hand melody of a piece, while playing the chords in the left hand. Usually, getting the right hand melody isn't too difficult, but it can be really challenging for me to get the chords in the left hand. It's not that I don't know the chords-most of the chords I can figure out-but that it takes me some time to figure a lot of them out; there's a whole process of analysis of the musical chord notation in front of me before I actually play the chord. This makes it so that, unless I \"cheat\" by writing in the names of the notes of some chords in the music, I have to stop my playing, figure out the chord, and resume playing. Do you have any tips on improving sight-reading when playing melody + chords? Is this just something that gradually improves with practice?",
        "answer": "things certainly improve with experience but make sure you are enjoying yourself. i don't have any specific advice about your musical situation because your background is the polar opposite of mine, so you're kind of getting at everything in reverse order from me"

        "answer": "inspiration is very intimate and it's kind of hard to say, other than to just give a blanket statement and say everyone inspires me (also true). but if you want to know what made me literally jump out of my chair with excitement, it's the way this guy ended his video at the very end of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjl3__lJLzA. To be fair, i probably wouldn't have jumped so high if it weren't for the fact that nobody,..... NOBODY out there ever has the balls to do it like this, and yet it's so simple"

Actually, now that i think about it, the problem just got worse. Just when i'd begun to figure out, at the very least, that \"savory\" might be considered an opposite to the word \"sweet\" (and i can't even figure out what that would be), you've just implied that it might be actually the opposite of \"crispy.\" This leads me to all kinds of bewilderment, such as \"is it not possible for something to be soft and sweet?\" So in conclusion i'd say i have even less of a grasp on the meaning of the word savory than i did just moments ago"

But here's the golden rule: if you hear about a rule and it doesnt click with you, or you dont like it or you dont get it or you dont think it works, case closed. you dont need it, you dont want it, dont use it. you dont need to worry about it, and it's none of your business. The only tricks and patterns in music you ever need to worry about are those ones that you can hold in your hand and feel like \"yes! i get it! i like this one, and i'm even ready to give it my own name if it doesn't have one already!\""

I think I internalized the praise of the people around me and started making things to impress other people instead of making things to enjoy myself. I stopped putting things in my work that represented me, because I was worried that critique of the work would feel like critique of me. I would work harder on things that impressed from a technical standpoint instead of something that spoke from my heart. I strived for 'perfection,' and as a result, my 'tech art' has become significantly more 'tech' than 'art'. I feel like I can no longer express myself. Any creative thing I can think of doing reminds me of all the stuff I did when I was in middle school, and I shudder at those memories which I have now deemed 'cringe.'

        "answer": "i honestly feel music is about as teachable as walking i don't have anything even close to a reliable way of calculating when 'scratch' was, what 'scratch' means, when or what the first 'song' was, what 'proper' means, .... it's lifelong. also certainly true that my earliest stuff ever shown on this website was likely created AFTER already having a number of years of experience in music greater than the lifespan of many of the listeners. this is probably an indication of my insecurity more than anything else it's common for me to latch magnetically onto a subject, or a skill, and drill into it obsessively for many weeks continuously. But here's the thing, there was a defining moment around when i was 12 when i had a realization that goes like this: \"hmmm, i'm noticing that out of all the....approx 297 of these types of obsessions i've had so far in my life, i feel like at least 211 of them have been music related\". Basically it became impossible to ignore that music was the most pervasive common thread between such a high percentage of these phases, and so i knew it wasn't going away. That being said, even to this day it's still not the entire picture. and yet it still keeps delivering new crazes in new ways"

So basically what happens is, when you spend years and years and years in that state, knowing you'll never finish or achieve anything if you care so much about every frame, eventually you learn that the only way out of this predicament is to, by some miracle, care much much much much much much less. i think you'll find that this scenario produces exactly the kind of results you described"

        "question": "One thing I have noticed in a fair number of your songs is the tendency for an instrument to appear often for nothing more than a single phrase or as an ornament. I am a big fan of the diversity that this lends to your sound, since it makes each listen feel like a new 'choose your own adventure' for which parts to focus down and study. I was wondering what thought goes behind these moments. Additionally, I was curious whether you have nicknames for certain sounds that you use (I admit that I do and am quite partial to alien trumpet, grumpy duck, etc.) I tend to personify sounds when I compose and that personality bleeds through into the parts they encompass, especially in the realm of synthesis where pre-established emotional connotations for sounds don't exist where they do for other instruments.",
        "answer": "the technique that creates the results you're talking about is kind of surprising because it kind of works backwards from the way you might think. i discovered it in 2015 and i will talk about it at great length at some poine if i haven't already i name sounds the same way i'd name anything. anything to help me identify it. animal names are certainly not off limits, but also fairly common is to refer to the name of the project i used it in for the first time. for example, 'pope phone' is probably the sound of the phone ringing when they called the pope to ask about the crusades that one time. perhaps i'd have one called 'violence bubbles' for that bubbly sound in the 'violence dont do it jingle'. and so forth"

        "answer": "when it's time to produce a new project, this is usually the full routine, if i feel i have enough time: first i'll do a big round of idea gen. so i'll come up with a whole pile of new ideas. file them away. Then, if i feel i have time, i'll do a bunch of rounds of middle-writing. which basically means you select an item (from the master list, not from the new items necessarily) and do a bit of writing on it, take it to the next step. Then once i've done that for a handful of items, then i'll switch to Selection, which is when we're actually choosing the item to be produced next. side note, you also need an idea-catcher, because new ideas will hit you at surprising hours of the day or night"

        "answer": "no need to discriminate. you can have both, you can do both, you can use both. there are advantages and disadvantages to each. the free gifted ones have the advantage of having a mythical quality to them and sometimes they are way deeper and more genuine sounding, but the disadvantage of course is that you have no control over when you get them, and also sometimes they're kind of bland or maybe even just something that already belongs to someone else. But for your idea-gen sessions, while it may seem like you could never get that same sparkle, the tip i have for getting the most out of the idea-gen is just do a lot. do A LOT. try to make the first 12 bad on purpose. Once you loosen up, you'll forget you're doing this and it will be essentially just like you're dreaming while you're awake, once the pressure is off. Also, ...... here's the other thing, when you do a lot of idea-gen all day, it will actually loosen you up so that when you take a break, or maybe in bed tonight or tomorrow, you'll find that you'll be suddenly receiving more of the rando gifts than you otherwise would. so it's a win-win. beyond that, just add them all to the same club and later down the line you'll find there's no need to discriminate between which ideas came from which methods. there's other methods too by the way"

        "answer": "it's different depending on which word. you may have actually summed it up well if you look at your hyphen usage. the ones with hyphen would probably want to be more clear, 'anteye' and the ones that are more well-known words that don't need a hyphen, would probably be quicker 'antie'. and yes i would understand it both ways. heck i even know what 'anticlockwise' means, even though i grew up saying 'counter clockwise'"

        "question": "A few years ago I got the opportunity for a job on the other side of the country and decided to take only the belongings that I could take on the train and try out something different for some indeterminate amount of time. I've been living very minimally and am learning about and working on some very specific things at an insane rate. Never would have thought I would be where I am. But... I've not been creating or performing music with myself or other people. The new thing has taken over the obsessive and creative energy part of me. The extent of the physical practicing I do is playing with drum sticks on the floor sometimes (but like maybe a few times a month). This would sound insane to the me from a few years ago. Maybe I care about the new thing more? I'm not sure. It's very technicalresearchy work, and I work on well defined problems and explain them with precise language and equations as well as more ill defined engineering problems with pragmatism. I care deeply about these things (mainly a sort of NEEDING to find some truth or answer), but they never seem to invoke feelingsthat truly match my experience of music. The only times I get that feelingof awe and verge of tears thing is when listening to a song. Usually it quickly fades though and the mind is back racing around trying to work on my research. Do you relate to any of these kinds of things? I don't know if this phase is one part of making my future creations better or if I'm in a trap. To be clear, I view the things I'm working on now as an example of those creations, but they feel less real somehow. I'm making the assumption that there are some similarities to working in \"all the departments\" for your productions or getting really nerdy about whatever you do.",
        "answer": "music is a magical power but, as i always say, it's usually only part of the picture. so you're really making the world go round by developing your non-music side here"

        "question": "i'm learning the guitar. do you think it's just a matter of time and practice before i can play ehat i think/what i hear? my left hand feels so clumsy when switching chords and my index finger stretches outwards when my pinky presses down and i don't know if that shouldn't happen. i feel like i don't know where exactly to learn the basics of \"harmony.\" it feels like constructing chords requires some knowledge of harmony amd music terminology that i don't really know. i want to make music. i have come up with and recorded little melodies i thought of, but how do i do that with... chords? also, chord melody is a concern for me. if i want to play chord melodies, is it the same as playing the chords of a scale based on the intervals between the notes? HARMONY IS CONFUSING! i get the magic of harmony, adding notes on top of notes and all, but i have no idea where to start or how to improve. also constructing chords or harmonies on guitar isn't as intuitive as piano. or is it? i just want to play the beautifully rich sounds i hear in like Chick Corea's and Stevie Wonders' stuff, or in McCoy Tyner's, or Barney Kessel's work too... please help me, give me some direction. i know you're more piano-and-drums-and-bass, but please help! i hope i have explained my problem to you sufficiently",
        "answer": "yes but don't forget to have fun right there, in your own life, in your own experience, with your favorite instrument(s) fine, but it really won't work right unless you discover it actually YOURself, with YOUR emotions. Everyone on earth who's ever tried to 'explain' how music and harmony works has essentially explained it wrong, and effectively you will too, in a new way not quite like anyone else's. that's why you have to find this yourself. then later you can make friends with all the other people who found similar things but slightly different i'd say if you are in '1 note at a time' mode, just start playing around with maybe SOMETIMES allowing 2 notes. for example if you have a melody, find just ONE note in the melody that can have a helper note with it at the exact same time absolutely not so is speaking, and making coherent word sounds with your tongue and mouth shape. i bet you would never be able to explain how you do that. and yet, somehow, after years of fumbling around, you've got it now and it's totally natural to you yes i think i'd recommend the above approach, to harmonize just 1 melody note with one other note, at just one moment of your favorite song melody harder in some ways, easier in other ways just like learning a language, the bad news is it takes a long time, the great news is that if you actually are enjoying yourself enough to stay in the game for long enough, there is literally no stopping you from being just as good as any of your favorite names. but you're gonna have to taste the food for yourself, one bite at a time"

        "question": "You've mentioned in the past how your work process has 3 roles in it, the idea-creator, the idea-chooser and the idea-finisher. I wanna hear how you think the chooser works, cause oftentimes I find myself with loads of different cool ideas that I want to realize, and what ends up happening is that I get a bunch of unfinished scraps which I don't have the motivation to finish, or which I'm frustatingly unable to figure out how to complete. How does the chooser pick the best ideas so that the creator doesn't get bogged in unhelpful unfinished projects?",
        "answer": "it's more roles than that, but that may have been in context of someone's specific question about their own process there's no need for the list to bog you down. the list is a well of opportunity. When you the 'procucer' decides \"it's time to produce something\", the 'selector' then goes into the list, and, by some method, makes a selection, and hands the selection to the producer. And then the producer produces that selection, and the selector does not make a selection until the producer has produced the previous selection. So the only burden, is basically what the selector selects. and yes it's a lot of pressure on the selector to make a selection that everyone is happy about, but there's no need for the LIST to be a burden. it's just the selection that's the burden. but of course it's not a burden, because the fun fact here is that any idea can be worked good. In either case, whether or not you love the selection, your motivation for following through on it might often be the sheer excitement of what you can produce next. i think the power of this method probably comes from a firm agreement you have in the scheduling department to simply continue to produce things diligently one after another, as a coping strategy for the overwhelming potential at stake"

I think I hate a lot of things, and I'm not sure how to start loving or if I'll ever be able to. Have you ever had similar thoughts?

Typical scenario is I have a pretty cool intro and section A and maybe chorus, but when I try to build on it to create more sections/choruses/bridges it just feels like a different song stuck onto the first one and not like a fitting continuation. The problem intesifies when i try to \"finish\" a song after more than an evening or two pass, but i'm not always able to find time for it. Do you have any advice to writing parts of songs that are consistent with the previous parts?",
        "answer": "the most immediate advice that comes to mind for your particular situation is this: some of those words you used, \"Section A\", \"chorus\", \"build\", \"bridge\", \"consistent\", \"writing parts\", \"continuation\", \"fitting\", i think you urgently should forget all of those words immediately. Not that they aren't good words, but in your situation i think i would advise you to forget those words immediately, they seem to be really suffocating you and holding you back quite tragically here"

This means that probably no one on Earth is \"normal\" but it also means your chance of falling into the top 1% on at least one of those traits is 1\u2212(0.99)^60 or 45.3%. This becomes more likely the more traits you consider. Do you think these statistics nerds rediscovered something fundamental about human nature that we already knew?",

        "question": "In your answer to someone asking whether or not you liked imaginary numbers, your answer was: ' i do now, ever since i started thinking of positivity and negativity as a full circle instead of just binary' Could you elaborate? I hold a linier view of positivity and negativity.",
        "answer": "think of positive 1. on the right side of the number line. it's totally positive, always positive. 1 times 1 equals 1. Now think of negative 1, on the left side of the number line. always negative. Negative 1 times negative 1 equals positive 1 (the negatives cancel out). but imagine that these two points (left and right, negative and positive) are actually part of a circle that goes all the way around. 1 straight up would be a number called \"i\" in mathematics. imagine that this number can't decide whether it's positive or negative. it's half positive half negative. So what's i times i? 'i' can't decide whether it's positive or negative, so you take one of each. like 1 times -1. the result is negative 1. And this is of course exactly the definition of i, it's the square root of negative 1. Directly straight down would be negative i, which of course also squares to negative one because like the upper i, it also can't decide whether it's positive or negative so you also get one of each, except technically in the opposite order"

I guess another way to put this question would be how do I go about generating that creative spark? because once I have an idea I can easily follow it and then the music just writes itself.",

Here's maybe the most important reason why: one of the things most sorely missing from most music is the non-musical elements. And, one of the most sorely missing elements from non-music is actually a musical element. Music and non-music are best friends and co-conspiritors.

(but again..... what if i could make it good? that's why i'm scared to delete) just suspend everything else in my life and try to write and record as many songs as humanly possible? some combination of all of these? the problem with recording is..... it takes forever. like actually forever. anyways, sorry for the brain dump. just curious what your thoughts on the matter might be",

        "question": "Could you elaborate on the music and non-music thing. it seems to come up a lot in your answers but I'm not sure what you mean.",
        "answer": "ok, this answer might make you feel frustrated, but your question makes me feel frustrated, through no fault of your own. my response to what you've asked is, \"what don't you understand about it?\" that being said i realize there's no answer to what i've just asked you and i apologize for that too music and non-music are always found together, in support of each other. For example: a song featured in a movie. You usually like the song better when it's in the movie, and it also makes the movie better to have the song in it. Another example: background music in a movie-- the music is the music, and the non-music would be the dialogue and what's happening in the scene. the music is there to make the scene stronger (hopefully). Another example: Joey Your-favorite-artist, singing a song. the music would be the music, and the non-music would be the words and ideas being expressed, or even the identity and personna of the artist, to whom you may feel a special connection. Another example: an instrumental song by Ricardo the Really Good Xylophone player. even if there's no words in the song, the non-musical element here is Ricardo himself and perhaps the crazy hat he's wearing, on the album cover, which you probably can't help thinking about when you listen to the music. Ok so now you may ask me this: What if you are going shopping in a store and you hear the same xylophone song, WITHOUT knowing who the artist is or seeing his crazy hat. you're probably thinking, \"aha, here's a situation where it's just the music and no non-music\" NOT TRUE, the non-music here is obviously YOU SHOPPING, which when combined with the song creates an unforgettable shopping experience"

But your analogy for language still holds fine for computer programming. you were saying a professional language user no longer thinks, while the pro computer programmer still does think, well that's not true -- a professional language user is still thinking about the thoughts they are expressing, but not thinking about language. and just the same, a pro computer programmer is thinking about the functionality they wish to achieve, while no longer thinking about the punctuation and syntax they are using"

        "answer": "yes it's a text file with audio references as needed i think you have it backwards. you are suggesting that i may have written an end, but then decided to fade it instead. but that never happens. what does happen sometimes is the exact opposite: it's written to fade, but then as i'm playing it, as a player, i have to actually stop sometime, and it ends up being worth including the way it stops. an example of this would be the end of \"movie star\". and an example of the exact same thing happening to somebody else would be the end of \"new frontier\" by donald fagen i still can't figure out the schedule for this actually"

On the other hand, a totally different reason for the symptoms you've described; if you're talking to someone you regard very highly, and you feel anxiously eager for them to respect your.... 'correctness' of language use, then this can cause you to fall apart. because let's face it, good speaking communication requires a bit of something much rougher around the edges. and you're having trouble relaxing because of the fear that you might...... misconjugate"

I don't know what the heck a 'record town' is or why I sang it at the time, but it really fits so well rhythmically/melodically and for some reason (though I can't pin it down) it even fits the feeling I'm trying to express in the song. I've tried playing with the words, maybe changing 'record' to wrecked up' or something... but \"record town\" just hits right and I feel like I need to keep it.",

        "question": "in your opinion, does using complex music theory ideas in a song (i.e. micro-tonality, complex time signatures, complicated voicings or whtever) automatically make it good? if it aims just to be complex in the sake of being complex does it lack depth for it if it isnt effective to the listeners? is inherently simple music with simple chord progressions or melodies bad even if its effective to the listeners?",
        "answer": "no, there is no 1 thing or method that guarantees 'good'ness of music for any one person or another here's the twist, some listeners like that. people who are currently engaged in some kind of an advanced musical studying program, might enjoy purposefully complex music. On the other hand, there are also some ways of complexifying music that are extremely entertaining for even the least musically educated listeners no, simplicity is often a great strength for music. but it's also not the only strategy"

        "question": "Hey bill. I know this may not exactly be your area of expertise, but i was wondering if you might have some wisdom. I'm college-age and have completed two half-year contracts as an orchestra (band) pianist on cruise ships. I've been eyeing the musical director role on ships for many months, and it looks like that goal is achievable within the next year or so. But I tend to be impatient and am afraid that this might take time away from my ultimate goal of being a composer/songwriter and conductor on land. Yet it would be my first directorial role and would undoubtedly be extremely useful in the future. How do I deal with this impatience? Obviously you're not me and i know you haven't done ships, but any insight into the music business is helpful.",
        "answer": "i have no idea. i've seen many people ponder over the 'cruise' or 'not to cruise' decision, and i've seen it go both ways. heck, i may have considered it at one point. i guess you're gonna find out exactly how strong your land ambitions ('landbitions') are"

        "question": "i get this thing where i feel \"right\" \"good\" \"different in a good way\" and often times the consequence of this is to try to capture it in a bottle for either others consumption or my own consumption in the future, when the feeling is gone. But I realize that often times that desire and process is external to the feeling, thus killing it in the process, and nothing left to capture. Do you find that music allows for this process to persist while hopefully capturing some of it in the process? Sometimes the right words come to express it, but whenever the goal is to express what it is, it feels like it leaves, it scares it away. its like a magnet thats attracting something by being, but as soon as it wants to attract something it faces it, and by that action gives it the opposite pole. I feellike maybe it is more important to let this feeling permeate more and moreand not worry about capturing it. and maybe later ill be so familiar with it that i can draw a map to it, instead of trying to capture it which seems futile.",
        "answer": "every artist is familiar with this phenomenon. it may seem like a bizarre relationship, but this is the entire nature of who and what we are, and the entire conscious experience. 'Capturing', despite being so 'impossible', is actually meant to be the greatest game you can imagine"

        "question": "Sup Bill, did you know that Gadsby is a 50,000-word book that, at no point, contains that fifth anglophonic glyph? That's right--Gadsby's author built a book 260 flips long without utilizing such particular symbol. A work such as this that avoids using a particular symbol is known as a Lipogram. You may think, \"Constructing a lipogram shouldn't bring about too much difficulty,\" but if you try, you may find out it's actually kind of hard. Constraining your vocabulary, particularly to words that don't contain said most common glyph, truly cuts all amount of words you can form. I know I'm struggling with it, and I'm just making a short paragraph for an inquiry, far from Wright's 50,000-word triumph. So, you know what, it may take a bit, but why don't you try your hand at it?",
        "answer": "no i did not no, i wouldn't think that. omitting that symbol sounds obviously difficult, if you think about how commonly it normally occurs i am not shocked. ok but first, i'm sorry to point out just.... a tiny thing wrong with your... 12th to last word. to be fair, you probably forgot to do spall chack"

That being said, there's no need to know what you want, nor to put pressure on yourself. how about this: just make plans to discover which way you really want to go"

        "question": "If you were gonna say no, But changed your mind to say yes when you thought about it. What did you reaally think about that would turn your initial answer around to then abswer the opposite. What was your thought proccess?",
        "answer": "let's look at some examples. someone said \"Why do you think people started building things? Maybe Boredom?\" my first instinct was no, this is absolutely not the reason for building. building things is because you want to do a lot of things that you can't do because you don't have the tools to do it. so you need to build things to help accomplish what you need to. 'boredom' seems like a very wrong way to describe the root cause. but then i was trying to figure out what is the cause behind wanting to do more complex things than were ever possible before. and it became harder to deny that 'boredom' COULD be a way to describe this, even though i'd probably prefer to use a word like 'curiosity'. i suppose it could be argued you could be curious about the future while being bored of the past. so ultimately i couldn't really disagree with the person's initial suggestion Let's look at another example: someone said \"do you love satiation\". at first i just didn't recognize the word. so i probably would lean toward no. then i did some surface level research and also remembered the word \"insatiable\", which is a word i like to use, especially while rubbing my fingers together to comminicate the concept of an unquenchible desire. and this led me to the conclusion of heck yeah i'd love to be satiated Let's look at just one more example, because \"where there's 2, there's more\" Someone said \"Have you ever had a fever where the only prescription was more cowbell?\" my first instinct was, this is not a question, this is a quote, from a famous saturday night live sketch starring christopher walken. therefore the person asking this here is not really asking what this is asking, they're just repeating a quote. and so to stay grounded in these situations i often use the cold hard truth as a go-to. my instinct was to say no, because i have so much to say about what it means and what it takes to really assemble music arrangements, it just felt initially so unlikely that this bit would actually ring true. But after thinking about it for a moment, it suddenly occured to me that this happens all the time. in the course of music production, it is absolutely not at all uncommon to find yourself deeply hankering for a cowbell at certain choice junctures"

        "question": "for a long time i shared your opinion (forgive me for paraphrasing) that albums are disappointing since they don't enhance the experience of listening to any one song. but recently i've been thinking of albums as playlists made by artists for me to listen and pick out my favorite songs. this makes sense because, if an artist made a song i really like, chances are they made other songs i'll like. do you agree? would love to hear your thoughts on this",
        "answer": "i find that when i am only presented 1 with song at a time i automatically cherish it way more. and whenever i am presented with a full album of songs, for some reason i never seem to like more than maybe 30% of one"
