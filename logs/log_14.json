But as you sink lower into desperation, simpler possibilities become more and more exciting. So ultimately if you sink down low enough, heck even just the idea of doing each project one at a time in alphabetical order, that suddenly seems incredibly exciting because in a world where you were scared that there are no possibilities, there now actually is one"

        "question": "Hi, I'm the guy that has problems with the perfectionism. You asked If perfect even is a good quality, and this is a valid question. I obviously know that mistakes and so on make the song better. Quantization ruins the groove and mistakes enhance the finished artwork to a level a \"perfect\" song never could achieve. Like the missing arms of the venus of milow. Obviously a mistake, but makes the statue sooo much better Anyway, I want to reformulate the question a bit, because this is not exactly what I was trying to ask. It's not that the song has to be perfect but I have to be satisified 100% with my Song to release it. But you probably know that we artist get sick of our songs bc we listen to it so much. So my question is: Are you always 100% satisified and a fan of your stuff at the time of release or in production? Or do you think \"ahh it sounds bad but I release it anyways\" and if so, how can you release stuff that you aren't 100% satisfied with? This is I think much more what I was trying to ask.",
        "answer": "i have to convince myself that i am, even if just for one moment. otherwise i'd never get out of there if you get scared to release it, then just don't release anything and wait for that to drive you so ridiculously insane that you'll be ready to strike a deal with yourself"

        "answer": "if you say something is over produced, it's like you are saying \"it feels like they worked really hard on this but i still don't like it\". probably the reason this happens all the time is because music is so fragile and no one actually knows what makes good music, and whether something is 'good' or not pretty much defies all logic, so certainly if you try try try try try try try try really really hard, yes that could likely ruin it"

        "question": "do you think you've ever made art that could be considered \"avantgarde\"? what do you consider to be avantgarde?",
        "answer": "in my view, here's where the 'avantgarde' comes into play. It's when you're bursting with creative desire but for one reason or another you feel like a hopeless amateur in whatever field you're working in. you feel technically under qualified and under-experienced, for some reason. and of course the only way to get good is to start getting some practice, but you're so concerned that the first few hundred steps you take will seem horribly lacking and underprofessional. and so you get to work, and blame the avant garde. under the guise of 'avant garde', the low-brow has a chance to immediately become high-brow. trash can go on display in a museum. heck, if you can't get into a normal museum, make an avant garde museum, which can of course be made anywhere. Maybe that sounds too easy, or trivial, but, i can assure you: the avant garde is very real, it's rock solid, and it can be a real life saver when you need it"

I'm not suggesting you try both for this project, but i am probably suggesting you try it one way for this project and the other way for another project. it doesn't matter which order you try them, and you can almost be sure that there's probably an alternate version of you in a different reality who did it in the opposite order. could even be fun to pretend that's you the first time around"

        "question": "oh my gosh i just have to share this with you: i was working on a video and i was debating 16:9 and 3:4, and took note of the common resolution number 1440. then i was synchronizing an animation to music and needed something to spin at 180 degrees every ~4 frames to be a 16th note in length per revolution - and needed it to spin for eight (8) 16ths notes which let me to this same number i was working with earlier when calculating: [total rotation needed for 180 degrees/16th over eight (8) 16th's] or 8 * 180 = 1440(degrees) and i was quite taken aback upon reading that from the calculator. and now i wonder why resolutions use these circular numbers and also why do circles. couldnt # of degrees per 1 rotation be based on any number besides 360? wait is it a CIRCLES RESOLUTION? im glad you were here for this unplanned epiphany thanks for being someone to talk about this to",
        "answer": "the reason 360 is a good number for a circle is because it divides well. you can divide by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 and still have a whole number. very useful. screen resolutions probably also have usefulness in being well dividable, for example if you want to display something at half size, or a third size. 1440 can also be neatly divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. so it's not the hugeset coincidence that you ran into 1440 twice in this process."

The gods existence arises from the shared agreement that they exist. Through the plecebo effect, actions taken by the Gods become real to those with faith. Once those who beleive reach critical mass, the God begins to grow powerful. If a human can fit the description of the deity, and convince the faithful he has mantled it. That human now has the power to control the plecebo effect in their followers and can cause miracles like healing wounds that wouldnt heal. All by plecebo effect. What are your thoughts on this?",

That would affect like almost only people in the rich, because they're the only ones that can watch it, like you and me, who think and care about big 'important' countries that are rich and prosperous. perhaps i'm just talking absolute nonsense",

I think it's interesting that we could be listening to the same music, but hear very different things. It would be fun to listen to you describe what you hear in real time, so maybe I could learn to hear those things, too.",
        "answer": "sure, but what's most important to underline, above all, is that anything can happen i just let the song play, whilst i can hear it. then just see what happens. preparing to be surprised, on the deepest levels if possible deep down, whenever we talk about music (you, me, or anyone), really we're just making connections between what we think happened in the song, and anything else we may be familiar with. there's no limit to the different kinds of things that can be envoked in such a conversation. the more the merrier"

        "answer": "this touches on a very interesting point of logic: just because infinite things are true doesn't mean everything is true. another way to look at it: there could be infinite kinds of dogs while STILL none of them being a cat"

        "question": "i've been guitaring and whatnot for a couple years now and i got the idea to make a shitty little EP just cause i want to play music and get music out there. i have a tendency to procrastinate indefinitely if i'm not actually making steps towards something. but 15 minutes of trying to figure out how you record stuff has totally zapped me of any desire to do it. even like, buying mics, i don't know what a compressor is. it's an entire new skillset (and money sink) i wasn't prepared for. penny for your thoughts",
        "answer": "yes i give this thought all the time. at the risk of boring some people to death who always hear me give the same advice, i will say that the feeling you are having is exactly what happens when you start too big. now you may be saying 'but wait, i didnt think i was starting that big', well, too bad, it's still too big for you at this moment. and so youve been knocked on the ground. The answer to this is extremely simple, and it's just to start smaller. For example, you say 'i dont know what a compressor is.' Ok, great. then dont use it right now. Honestly, it's a huge shame that you have even heard of a 'compressor' right now, because all it's doing for you is bringing you some sense of 'obligation' to do something youve never even identified, never consciously needed or wanted, means nothing to you at this time. which is precisely why you had no energy to think about it. So anyway, back to a mic, because yes you do want make music that can be stored in a bottle and played back at a different time (i believe that was your original desire.) This is a lot like going up a staircase. when you approach the stairs for the first time, are you saying \"Which step SHOULD i go to? which is the best and most professional step, to step on?\" and then you get overwhelmed and pass out into a depressed nap. but what you should have asked instead is ARE ANY OF THE STEPS STEPPABLE, FROM THE GROUND. are any of the steps right next to the ground where i can step on it. the answer is yes and that would of course be step number 1 for you. Anyway, back to mics, dont buy a mic, the golden rule to start, is of course 'use the one you already have.' Yes, if you really dont have any microphone device, then go to the nearest store and buy any mic, but the thing is i'm sure you actually do already have a microphone device. almost any device that can type something into this question box probably has a mic on it. in contrast to that horrible dreadful feeling of confusion and guilt, i think you may find that the idea of starting your musical journey using only whatever's already right there with you on your deserted island, is just absolutely romantic. you can take your pet volley ball along"

On the other hand, what's almost 0% known, before production, would be anything textural, or any instrument or sonic choices, and the specific ways those instruments and sounds coalesce to deliver the song content and support the vocal. those issues are all wide open"

        "answer": "it sounds the same. if i'm understanding what you're saying, an example would be \"the roads're closed\". if you say this at a normal conversational speed, it's gonna sound identical to as if you said \"the roads are closed\". so then it's just an issue of which way you wanna write it. but as i look back over your question, i'm starting to think i'm not actually sure exactly what you're saying"

        "answer": "well, try doing something for 4 days and see if that feels like several days to you. on paper, the word 'several' may look like 'seven', but go and see what the experience counts for. also this raises an interesting issue which is 'several' things are likely to be part of a sequence. if you have 7 items all at once, i almost think that might be called a 'bunch'. but it also depends on the size of the item and what the reasonable quantities are. for example if you had some grains of rice in a bag and you poured about 23 grains onto a plate, you can easily call that a few. it wouldn't really feel like 'several' unless you took them out one at a time"

        "answer": "yes i can see how overexposure could devalue something. this reminds me of a realization i had about my question answering, somewhere within the first few months. and adjusted accordingly and felt a nice improvement because of that adjustment. in fact, ever since that adjustment, what i always find myself doing is answering something clearly and completely and then go back and realize that it shines way brighter with only about half that, and basically just delete the second half. happens all the time. that being said, i'm not sure that applies exactly to this question, until i said this and now it does, until i said that and now it doesnt, until i said that and of course now it doesnt again and now it really doesnt. but then of course now it does again. thanks for reading"

Whenever that happens, I often just pause the song and imagine in my mind how I would transcend the song, and then I end up wondering why the artist didn't transcend it like that, or why they didn't transcend it at all. Can you relate to some of this mild annoyance?",
        "answer": "maybe they aren't capable of doing it like you could do it. or, maybe they transcended in a different way and you just didn't follow it. or, maybe they did not actually think they were 'setting themselves up to transcend.' so many different ways for this to play out, but the underlying factor is simply that we're not all on the exact same trip at each given time. it's kind of a miracle that music ever even connects to anyone at all. which is why i am hesitant to place blame when it doesnt, even if the 'problem' may seem so clear to me at a certain point in time. the best thing here is probably to save it for your own work. and actually the fact that you're feeling this critique, this can be seen as a mounting desire for you to make your own music"

        "answer": "i think that would be pinning down a perfectly useful word too tightly. having any connotation with the time period you mentioned, is not something i feel the word would still carry by default. there's no reason the word 'futuristic' should not be still generally available to mean 'of or relating to the future' and i think anyone can easily get away with using it this way in conversation, and be immediately understood"

        "answer": "i've never heard of that specific effect, but keyboards often have a lot of stuff that works for non-players. if you are a player (keyboard player, piano player, musician, someone who likes to play all your own notes) then you'll find you often need to tweak the sounds to simplify them so you can actually get your moneys worth out of the actual notes you played. Like imagine if your letter keyboard had full sentences every time you type one letter. Handy if you don't know how to type your own sentences, but if you do know how to type your own sentences, then you're going to get more benefit out of something that will just put down the exact letters you type when you type them"

        "question": "Hey Bill! I am trying to write my own music and Im wondering what you would recommend I focus on learning next. I'm comfortable with 7th chords and I finally understand the difference between dominant 7s vs. Major and minor 7s. I know the major scale (do re me fa so la ti do), and I can use the chords/scale degrees (I ii iii IV V vi vii) to build progressions.. But I feel like when I write, I keep playing octaves and a 5th on the left hand and major or minor triads on the right. Now that I learned all major, minor and 7th chords in root position, everything I play as a roman numeral progression sounds so similar (and not very great since I don't know my inversions yet) I'm vaguely comfortable using diminished/augmented chords or some passing chords here and there and I'm familiar with raising the bass note a whole step up for a jazzy slash chord at the very end of a phrase... But other than a few things like that, my jazz vocabulary is pretty limited and I can't seem to figure out how you do all these complex key modulations. There has to be a better way than aimlessly watching a bunch of jazz music theory videos on YouTube, right? Should I grind out the inversions? Should I learn how to write in minor keys? If you have a textbook I could read or anything to point me in tne right direction, I'd really appreciate your help!",

It may certainly be true, but it's not what it feels like. when i try to collaborate, actually, what it feels like is that i'm a total genius and the other person is an idiot. which, needless to say, is totally obnoxious and i would not want to subject anyone to that. that being said, i am still not ruling out the fact that i am a total idiot and just don't realize it. heck, i've seen that happen to plenty of people, there's no reason why it couldn't or shouldn't happen to me"

        "question": "I was in a language learning Discord server at some point, and someone brought up a really interesting practice method. First some context. Suppose person A speaks French and wants to learn English, and the reverse for person B. Sometimes these people get together for \"language exchange\", which in this case is having a conversation in French, and then the next will be in English, and they'd alternate like this at whatever frequency A and B agree upon. The problem is that people who engage in this practice are usually not yet familiar enough with the language to make non-trivial sentences themselves, which greatly limits how complex the conversations can get. So it's hard and somewhat boring. The idea is that since these people need more input in their target language, they should just have conversations where A speaks French and B replies in English. They both get natural input in their respective target languages, without being limited in what they want to say. This sounds great on paper, so I'd like to convince the entire universe to try it to see how well it holds up in practice. How would I go about this?",
        "answer": "i already know that's a great method. and it sounds like you suspect it also. of course what i would suggest is not to go trying to convince the entire universe of something. if it's good, the universe will probably find out anyway. and if it's not, then they'll be pretty mad at you for trying to force this on them"

        "question": "when you try to find the prime factors while waiting in a line, are you doing this in your head???? how do you even go about doing that?????",
        "answer": "yes i do it in my head, it's a casual empire of skill i've been quietly building over the past 15 years or so. to tell you every trick and technique might take 15 years, but, for example, let's say the number is 166747. i could tell you how to tell it's not divisible by 2, but you probably already know how to do that. i could tell you how to tell it's not divisible by 3, but, they probably already taught that one to you in school. i could tell you how to tell it's not divisible by 5, but you probably already know that also. they tend to teach you in school there's not really any trick to checking anything higher, so i will tell you how to check 7 (or anything). manipulate it by adding or subtracting multiples of 7 until you shrink it enough to recognize it. level it off to a zero at the end and drop the zero, because dividing by 10 never changes its 7-status. you can also divide by 2 if it ever becomes even, if you feel like it. 166747 --> 16674 ---> 1666 ---> 161. i already recognize it there, but if not then you'd subtract 21 and get 14. which you probably recognize. but then again, i'm not really sure where other people are at on this, because i've been thinking about numbers all my life. i'm perfectly familiar with 14 as a multiple of 7, but i have no idea if this is general common knowledge to other people. 1001, 501, 301, 203, 323, 216, 1024, all those numbers are just as familiar to me as 14, just because of how long i've been doing this, but i have no idea how far others have gone on this. so that's why i was able to stop when i hit 161, because i already recognize that as 23x7, and to get there i readily used 7, 14, and 56. this was me trying to give a short answer, are you proud of me"

        "question": "During a lecture, a composition teacher told us that when you're composing, there are various rules that you're made aware of in some way (this is mainly referring to Western music)-rules of harmony, of cadences, of structure, of arrangement, etc. and you have three ways to interact with these rules-you can either: a. rigorously follow them and let your musical creativity flow within the confines of these rules, b. allow yourself some freedom and flexibility with these rules by stretching, bending and occasionally breaking them as you see fit while still keeping them in mind (he symbolized this as making a sort of mutual compromise between you and these rules), and c. completely disregard these rules and make your own rules. Now, this is clumsily paraphrased, but you get the idea, I hope. I thought that that was an interesting way to think of it, but what do you think? Do you think any of those options correspond in some way to how you write music? If so, which one(s)?",
        "answer": "the flexibility is a fine sentiment, but i think there's an elephant in the room. if you even try once to 'describe' one of these 'rules', it slips through your fingertips like gourmet slime butter. and you should never follow a 'rule' because you 'think' you 'should', only follow a rule because you adore the taste of gourmet slime butter. that being said, the flexibility spectrum of how much and how little, let's say, 'predictability' to employ, that is still very much in play, and can be dialed in, to taste"

        "answer": "you surely know what you're doing, musically. now it's just a matter of how you talk about music with other people. i think you're gonna be fine. you're gonna be way better off than people who tried to learn how to read before they learned how to play. usually for those people life makes no sense and they quit. so at least you've got your spirit intact, that's a major plus"

        "question": "I think it's interesting how the medium influences how music is written and presented. Like, pre-recorded music you had pieces of all sorts of lengths because there was no need to \"fit\" a piece of music onto a radio or record. Then with recordings you had a very pretermined \"quantity\" of music you can fit on there .. you started seeing the famous 3-5min long song for radio and 45's/singles, and maybe a full album, cassette or CD you can have somewhere around 30-45min of music. I think it's weird though that in the digital age, not much has changed since the early days of recorded music. With less people buying hard copies of music and internet/streaming becoming more common than radio...The digital age is more similar to the pre-recorded days in that you can have a piece of music last however long you want since you dont need to fit it into a physical medium... and yet, we still see a majority of songs (at least popular songs) fitting in that 3-5min range and albums (though not as popular as they once were, with many artists putting out singles instead of albums) are still typically in that 30-45min range when an artist does put out an album. Do you think streaming and stuff like that just hasn't been around long enough yet for popular music to start taking more liberties with song/album durations? Or is the 3-5min song 30-45min album just a sweet spot that we've hit that we'll stick to regardless of how the music is being released/listened to?",

        "question": "I've sometimes heard other self-employed artists who make content for YouTube say that while they love their jobs, one thing that they kind of miss from having a \"normal\" job is that it makes it easier to have a good work-life balance-if you work a 9-to-5, in most cases, you have a certain amount of time in the day when you're on the clock, at the office (or wherever you work), working; but once your shift is over, you have time left over in the day to do other non-work-related activities, and go to bed at a fairly consistent time every day-therefore the day is clearly separated into time when you're working, and time when you aren't. But when you're your own boss and work from home or in a studio, there's not that same clear separation between time for working and time for doing other things, so it's easy to get so caught up in the work you're doing-because you're passionate about it-that it occupies the large majority of your day, which isn't inherently a bad thing, but that can lead to not having much time for anything else-such as going outside, hanging out with friends, or even sleeping-which can have long-term negative effects on your relationships and health. Can you relate to these struggles in any way? Do you have any advice for self-employed artists having difficulty maintaining a good work-life balance?",
        "answer": "i've tried every different way, but i'm still not sure which one is 'best'. perhaps a rotation through different strategies over time is inevitable. that being said, plenty of cool permanent strategies and habits find themselves along the way, but these are absolutely so different for each person, different people can be stylistically polar opposites in their work patterns. it's an exciting journey, and even if i knew exactly how it was gonna turn out for you, i wouldn't want to spoil it"

        "question": "why is it that one evening i can pull a random song fragment from my list and get an entire approximate verse, prechorus, and chorus from it withing 5 minutes.... but then i sit down multiple times over the next few days for hours and get absolutely nowhere with it? the lyrics are all pretty approximate and don't really make much sense together (and not in the fun way - in the \"this feels like it's trying to tell multiple different stories\" kinda way) i'm very very very confident in my structural/melodic choices (all of which came from that brief flash of songwriting), but it just feels like it doesn't wanna do anything else now. it's like i spotted someone dancing out of the corner of my eye, i looked at them, and then they got scared and ran away or something. and of course, this definitely isn't the only song of mine that's stuck in this exact situation. any advice here would be appreciated, thanks!",
        "answer": "the reason this songwriting thing is so unpredictable is because it's magic, but, here's what can help, in your situation. zoom out, zoom out. look at the big picture. let the whole history of this song flash in front of you. when did you first think of it? staying closer to how you got into it will also keep you close to how you're gonna get out of it. actually a really crazy trick which works for me pretty much every time is to start writing about the previous writing session. in the song. wild trick but i can't remember it ever not working"

So basically y'know how in the \"I'm a princess\" song you had this part where it transitioned from \"There's got to be so much more\" to \"But I don't know what it's there for\"? I don't know what it is or what it's called but I like it a lot when people do that. Could you maybe explain what it is by any chance? Thanks.",
        "answer": "basically it's like when you go from one room to another but you specifically like the feeling of the door frame when your shoe glides over it as you go through the door. in that moment, the melody is jumping from one harmonic room to another, and sort of sliding its foot across the doorframe, just to feel the change between the two rooms. Or, what the heck, maybe you are just talking about rhythm, maybe you just like it when someone hits the e of 4. two people can watch the same movie and react to totally different things about them, so there is no way to be sure what you are into about that part, but this is great news regardless because i always considered that part a crappy re-write (of something worse before, but still a crappy re-write) so it is very validading to hear that it works for you"

        "question": "If I remember correctly, almost three years ago, you expressed frustration that every time you felt like you had just become an expert at creating any given element of a video, you had to move on to the next element. Thus, you decided that for your next project, you would create about fifteen videos, but complete any given shared element between them one at a time. In other words, for example, if each video included a car, you would design every car for each video before moving on to the next element. How accurate are these memories? How well has this production strategy been working for you? When do you expect the project to be complete?",
        "answer": "yes, this is correct, except i had counted wrong, i should have said 11. it's been an extremely valuable experience in ways i both did and didn't expect"

        "question": "Hey bill. I can write a chorus but I have a hard time writing a verse. My verse melodies feel like filler. I want the verse to be as good as the chorus. Not sure what good means. Should the verse be catchy like the chorus? Hasn't worked thus far. Should I approach the verse differently?",
        "answer": "first of all, it's almost impossible to write backwards. if you have a 'chorus' but you need something to come before it and you dont have it yet, it's almost impossible to find it, you kind of have to get lucky. BUT, a wise real estate agent once told me, \"dont make the verse too good, you wanna save that for the chorus\". And i wanted to disagree with him at the time, but i do believe that strategy should lead you to constructive places. Actually here's something i always almost forget to suggest: Just run the chorus and see what you wanna do after the chorus. then just continue from there. and if your chorus is good enough, chances are you'll end up leading back to it again. Then, take that part after the chorus, and start your song there with some alternate lyrics and it should lead to the chorus just fine. BUT, all this babble about 'verse' and 'chorus', it makes me want to give a reminder: the duck expert who thought all animals had beaks never discovered any of nature's wonderful beakless offerings. sorry for answering this question 4 times at once, but you can see i have a lot to say on this"

        "question": "do you think some people have a more natural inclination towards creativity (in any medium) that is at least a little bit innate? as someone whose education path and hobbies leaned heavily towards \"maths/computers\" and other stereotypically \"logical\" stuff i found myself drawn to, i have long realised that i don't find any of that deeply fulfilling but worry i have too much of a stereotypically \"left-brain\" to actually have any unique or interesting creative expression. then again i realise this way of overthinking it is probably part of the issue. i do have very specific tastes and know exactly what i would want to do, but for some reason feel frozen and unable to free myself from this thinking. like it always leads me to believe something is fundamentally wrong with me when i see so many people express themselves creatively so effortlessly regardless of medium, especially when said person is also someone who does computer stuff and is somehow able to be skilled in two totally at-odds modes of thought so i guess the crux of my question is how do i let go of this? or am i doomed? if i were a 6 year old child with absolutely no care for anything, it would be so easy",
        "answer": "there's a lot to unpack here. you have very severe self-doubt built into you. this condition is of course common among artists, but it's something you probably just have to live with, for the most part. it also gives you huge powers because you care such a huge amount. you also mention you might be \"overthinking\", but again that's probably a common condition for artists, and probably something you'll have to live with, AND again, also a tremendous asset for creativity. if you can survive the damage it does to you on the bad days. Next, i have to point out a giant leap of reasoning you made that i dont think is fair: you say \"so many people express themselves creatively so effortlessly regardless of medium\". i see no reason to assume that. the confusion and turmoil you've described in yourself is easily a standard level of turmoil that artists can go through. Can be less, can be even more, but your assumption that it's such a breeze for everyone, that's way off. it's way way way way off. sure, at the moment the best stuff happens, that is a magic moment miracle breeze, but this is not without 1000x more moments striving, stressing, doubting, etc. or just waiting patiently for the clouds to clear, as if by magic. Anyway, the point is you've done the thing where you've assumed that it's \"so easy\" for everyone else, it is certainly not, and in many many many cases it looks extremely similar to the struggles you've described in yourself. The next thing i must point out that i think is really interesting is, you say \"am i doomed\". The person who likes cake and doesnt get to eat cake might assume they are \"doomed\" if they cannot eat cake. The person who does not like cake and is forced to eat it might assume they are \"doomed\" if they are forced to eat cake. So when you contemplate being \"doomed\", just by saying what this means youve already spilled the beans on what you want here. you want to be an artist, and if you 'cant' then that would feel like a deep failure. Not everybody even wants to be an artist. and they certainly wouldnt consider it 'doom' if they couldnt be. So just the fact that you are here thinking youre doomed if you cant do art, that tells you everything you need to know about who you are, and in a broad sense there is no need to worry about not becoming who you are. it means everything to you and you'll do it just fine, in your own way. and you did not convince me that there are any show-stopping obstacles preventing it. just wholesome challenges that you'll probably even feel thankful for later"

        "answer": "if you want to finish them you should set a time limit on these 'finishings'. because the ideal amount of work remaining is actually very little. and in many cases the best choice is to just declare it finished as is. A funny thing about real audiences: they actually often enjoy it more if it's 10% unfinished. it lets them use their imagination more, and it keeps them paying attention. On the other hand, to hear something 100% 'done' often feels alienating to an audience. there's the feeling it doesnt really care about their input"

'big' is comparable to something. but it's not always said. so that's where it gets tricky, because people dont always say what it's comparing it too. and then 'by how much' is also a threshhold that is not mentioned, but it's \"enough for you to care\". you can see how wishy washy this is, imagine how insane it gets when you try to quantify how 'good' a song is"

Also this particular sidewalk had a slight sideways slope to it. I was also aware of this. so i was walking very carefully. Anyway, despite walking carefully, i suddenly took a spectacular airborne slip, feet just fly up into the air and i'm in the air for a full .75 seconds probably and i land perfectly flat square on my back. (which surprisingly left no injury and barely any pain, only just a small bruise in the direct center of the back, nothing else). the pizza and cookie were fine but i lost the drink, had to go back and get another one. i told them what happened, they were very impressed"

        "question": "Hi Mr. Wurtz, I caught in a Scary Pockets track you were on that you use trad grip on the kit. I had to learn both but have always preferred matched. Exposing my bias, I'm a little down on trad because a lot of drumlines I've taught use it for the snares because it looks cool (which it does, admittedly), rather than thinking of the development of the student, where matched is more applicable to other instruments like the keys or timpani. Do you use it because it's what's comfortable, do you switch between the two depending on the song, do you use it because it's cool (a good reason for any individual, but not for a teacher to use exclusively unless the students have the desire to learn it imo), or for some other purpose (and if so, what)? Also big props from a random stranger here, you're crazy in the pocket and the dryness of the kit on those tracks really accentuates that. And the ghost notes? The Groove? Don't even get me started. The reason I wanted to ask you, as opposed to an even more random stranger, is because I respect you as an accomplished and skilled drummer and would appreciate any insight you have!",
        "answer": "disagree. most instruments the hands do something different that compliment each other and its very romantic in that way, many people would argue the origin was i think more practical than this, marching snares used to be slanted. But, my origin with it is totally random; basketball injury around age 10, then temporarily could not bend my left middle finger. so i switched. BUT, i was already hooked on dave weckl as a youngster and FOR SURE it looked cool, but i never had the motivation to switch (it's naturally weird at first). then that basketball fell on my finger, and i was like 'huh, i can still actually play if i switch to trad, might as well try it' and when my finger got better (maybe a week later?), as they say....... \"you never go back.\" (well at least a lot of people say that). Ok but so, as far as \"which one is better\", i will firmly stand behind freedom of choice. you'll be just fine either way. matched is totally good, it obviously makes sense, trad was created for obsolete technical circumstances, so it makes perfect sense that that one will fade away. BUT, here's the funny thing..... if you ask around, it always seems like everyone who does use trad grip........ LOVES it, and they say it's so much more inspiring and feels much more elegant to have your hands doing different things, and it feels like the hands are responding to one another 'organically'. people really fall in love with traditional grip. Like the manual stick-shifter in an car, this really seems to be one of those \"never go back\" things. it's something people really fall in love with"

In this case, would you ever donate the idea to someone else you know, who you think might be able to make something good out of it?",
        "answer": "the dirty truth is that almost every song idea feels like this at some point. so i actually have a pretty much religious devotion to the art of 'rescuing' song ideas. Even in a hypothetical rare case where a song is so 'good' and 'right' that it doesnt need to be 'rescued', it then IMMEDIATELY gets cursed because the expectation becomes so high it collapses the confidence of the whole endeavor. and then you need to rescue those by actually making them worse. it's hard to explain, songwriting is actually ridiculous"

But actually what we're talking about is the video from the day before the one you mentioned. \"i'm a piece of garbage\". Then, as the exercise goes, i randomly select another journal entry, and by sheer coincidence ANOTHER one from... like the next day (in 2007) came up. just as garbagey. after pondering for a moment what i'm gonna do about it, whether to skip it or whatever, as usual i realized the golden rule of creativity 'theres always a way' and i wrote a second jingle \"STILL a piece of garbage\" as a sequel. Is it true what they say about sequels always being less popular than the original? not in this case"

Hint: sing the words and melody, or, if it's for a filmscore, watch the scenes. if neither of those things exist yet, then usually dont do the chords first. Or if you do, dont think of \"writing chords\" when there's no melody words or scene yet. sure you can start with some chords, but only insofar as it gets you in the mood to start writing the actual thing youre writing (the words/melody/scene, what happens). Because without that, the chords will be complaining to you that their existence is meaningless. Chords are there to inject emotion subliminally into things. Without any 'thing' there to inject emotion into, chords cant even do their job. Like a hypnotizer beam with no one to hypnotize. I mean this is like at the dinner table, when you salt your plate first, and cant figure out which way to do it. salt the food not the plate. are you getting it"

        "question": "Hi Bill! Would you please talk about your thought process for writing drum and percussion parts? I love what they add to your songs, and as a non-drummer, I have little insight into them.",
        "answer": "for the most part, creating music is not a 'thought process.' In fact, as soon as you start having one of those, the music vanishes and everything turns to crap. So the whole game of music writing is to just basically wait for yourself to totally forget you were trying to do anything, and then the pure imagination takes over and goes totally wild. Then, you catch yourself having fun and then you start to try to 'think' about how to continue trying having fun which of course ruins it, and then you have to wait again until you forget about it again so it can come alive again. More specifically you asked about 'writing drum/perc' and so for that i have to say the same thing i said to the 'writing chords' person from a few things down, which is i'd say dont write those things, write the song. i mean, as a songwriter, if you find yourself 'thinking'.... about 'writing'... a 'drum part',..... its all over. better off taking a nap and then at least you might dream something"

        "question": "I wonder if there's an inverse relationship between contentment and creativity. I prioritize contentment, which I associate with peace, happiness, and gratitude. I'm comfortable in my complacency, and while I appreciate the arts and the people who make it, I am not creative myself. I'm wondering if creative people like you place less value on contentment, but instead have something like a restless dissatisfaction with the status quo that drives them to create, explore, and innovate. I'm starting to question whether contentment is worth striving for after all. Do you see a dichotomy between contentment and creativity/innovation? How does this play out in your life?",

        "question": "i've been trying to use your factoring method. i'm doing well on a number i was given online, but when i added 39 to turn 3471 into 3510, and killed the zero, i then got 13x27, which is taking me further. i couldn't find in the note you made that has the intructions on how to factor a number what to do if that works, since you ended up with a prime number. whats the deal?",
        "answer": "i'd say i think you missed 3. you start by checking 2, then 3, then 5, then 7 etc. and when you get a hit, divide it out. so in this case you'd divide the 3471 by 3, get 1157, check 3 again (you always have to check the same factor again after a hit because it could have multiple, but you never have to check past factors again). so then you continue on to check 7, 11, etc. Then you'd hit with 13, you'd have seen that probably by adding 13 to get to 1170, so 117, and you'd hit it that way. so 13 is in. Then you divide the 13 out, 1157 div by 13 is 89, and now 89 is the new 'big number' to continue with, or to be your answer, depending on your level of experience. theoretically if you didnt know 89 you would continue, i guess you'd have to check 13 again. but you actually dont anyway because 13 squared is already way bigger but if you knew that then you probably also knew 89 was prime anyway. but anyway, so then you just have to collect your results to get the primefactorization of the original number. 89x13x3"

        "answer": "no, i dont do it all. perhaps that's a whole different problem i'm not too worried about it. When i was very young i suppose i started to think most of the most popular stuff out there wasnt nearly good enough to deserve its popularity, but i've had many many years to get over that and be much more forgiving, and now i dont even notice it anymore. i'm just not worried about it. heck, take a lays potato chip and sell it and get a hit. see if i care. doesnt stop anything better from being an even bigger hit. the potato chip was probably just the in-between thing. actually now that i think about it, a potato chip sounds like a pretty solid idea anyway yes this is one of the ways we all tense up, from time to time. creativity comes from a mysterious place. you can't really control it. all you know is that it usually never wants to visit you until you've, eventually, calmed down. it doesnt really seem to care HOW you calm down, but it generally is never gonna show up until you do. the good news is, it WILL show up (eventually). last resort you will just exhaust yourself and fall asleep and it will be there in your dreams"

        "question": "You say you now do prime factorization with \"way bigger numbers\" than you used to. Can you provide an example of one of these numbers? Thank you very much.",
        "answer": "the standard is 9 digits, if i'm randomly selecting one for myself. but it's usually more fun if it's actually a number that i've seen somewhere, on a serial number or something. dollar bill serials work great. it gives the number just that extra hint of realness. That being said, if you go with 9 digits, AND it's high (starts with 9, let's say), AND it turns out to be prime, then it would probably take (just crunching the numbers here.....) years to figure it out. But if it does break down and has some factors, then it could be done in just a few minutes. the more prime it is, the longer it takes. for bedtime i always choose a 9 digit, because if i choose a 6 it's fairly likely that i will finish it and have to get up and get another one. the 9 digit is almost guaranteed to not be finishable before falling asleep. For example: i just random-selected a random 6 digit number (709456) to test this theory, exactly 7 minutes ago i selected it and now i have solved it (139,29,11,2,2,2,2). that was a fairly lucky selection because it halved its way down to 44341 almost immediately, and then i basically only had to check up to 29. honestly the hardest part was at the end i had to re-count how many times i halved it"

        "answer": "i can't tell you what's gonna float your boat. some people just make 3 words,.... some people would prefer to do things with the numbers. some people are so into the numbers that they eventually just start converting the letters into numbers to make the numbers longer"

        "answer": "it SHOULD be possible. why no one can do it, no one really knows. Maybe it has to do with the added pressure of knowing that it's going to be played back the exact same way every time. so it's a lot easier to have more fun if you know it can be a different way next time"

Totally other context that word finds itself in, is the expression \"control freak\" which just means you insist on having a lot of control over what you're doing. freak is not the rarest word in the world, and it shows up in a lot of different places usually with the help of other words to give it meaning"

        "question": "if something originated from love but isn't actually love it self - I wonder if there's a way to label that concept to still have awareness of that connection",
        "answer": "there certainly is. i would have no idea what it is because i have no knowledge of what's going on. the description you gave could apply to maybe a trillion different kinds of scenarios. They say Dr. Evil (the bad guy, you know, from the movies) the backstory is he was originally created out of love, but due to a lifetime of trauma he became Dr. Evil. as you say, \"originated from love but isnt actually love itself\". Okay but also, totally separate subject, if youve ever been to the Hallmark aisle at the store, with the greeting cards, the happy birthday cards, etc etc, ... Those paper greeting cards: they originated from the need to express love, but, the physical paper card itself is not actually love. again, as you say, \"originated from love but isnt actually love itself\". so maybe you are wondering if there is a single word or phrase that could apply to both greeting cards and Dr. Evil. but i suspect you had a specific scenario in mind, which you didnt say how about \"I Can't Believe It's Not Love\""

        "question": "i've been slowly getting the feeling that in order to make things and have them be seen by a large audience, i'd have to bend what i'm making to fit what modern social media algorithms prefer (more engaging, faster paced, etc). the problem is that this does not come naturally to me at all. so i guess i have to make a choice: make things how i'd like to make them (viewership: very low), or make things that would be more more palatable to the lovely algorithms that are so present in our modern world (viewership: possibly higher?). both strategies strike be as very bad, because i really really really would like to have an audience for the art imake, but also i'd like it to be for what i ACTUALLY WANTED TO MAKE. so like.... maybe i need a middle ground? but then i might just be getting the worst of both worlds, or maybe i'd get the best, i just don't know. thoughts? i think you went through similar stuff early on so i'm curious what worked. i've been thinking about this for years now and i'm slowly going insane. thanks",
        "answer": "of course i disagree ravenously and vehemently with all your baseline presumptions, and i've always firmly and deeply believed the exact OPPOSITE is true.

But what's happening is the parts near the middle get their volume increased less because they make less big of a spin. If you flip it, fill in the opposite part instead, more of the area is toward the edges, so when it spins around those parts create more volume when they are near the edges and have further to spin. at least that is my first intuition. honestly i had never thought about this before until you said it and it actually shocked me at first"

        "question": "History after the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt is merely a series of passing fads. The Great Pyramids were built long before much of humanity's greatest accomplishments. There they stood while humanity was busy with its perpetual-stalemate wars, failed revolutions, and temporary amusements. Technologies to speed things up or make things predictable, truths about the universe replacing one another in quick succession, works produced with intelligent consideration and careful hands and painstaking attention to detail and precious time, things getting better, things getting worse; the Giza Necropolis will outlive them all.

Any advice on things I could change/experiment with to have it sound fundamentally different to the original while maintaining those things? I was switching up the instrumentation and rhythms but it hasn't been hitting quite right.",
        "answer": "even if there were a right answer, there would also be no way to describe it without doing it, but, a recipe to get there is surely to do 100 cover songs and by about the 100th one you'll be pretty confident in what you can bring to the show.

        "question": "i find one of the best ways i work is when i impose artificial time constraints on myself, but then i've also noticed that this tends to lead to cases where i finish and release a project and then immediately wish i spent just a bittttt more time on it to either make it longer or more detailed or whatever. there's definitely a balance that needs to be found here, because someone watched one of my short animations that i hauled ass to make because i wanted to get it done in one night and they said \"i wish you could have added a conclusion\", when even i, while writing it, would have liked to go a bit longer. but i cut it to get it done in a night. when the next day........ i had lots of free time. idk, if i spend to long on things they just tend to stretch out into infinity, but also, i'd like to make rich, long things. thoughts?",
        "answer": "you can spend an entire lifetime encircling this problem. every way is wrong, but it turns out that's what makes you feel alive. hence 'lifetime'"

When either side gets too far ahead, the magic drops right out of it. the words and music are responsible for each other, they enable each other, they inspire each other, so if one's not there then one is basically just leaving a voicemail message for the other. When both are present simultaneously, you can take a hard left on a whim and everyone's on the same page"

        "answer": "sometimes the 'compression' youre talking about actually helps, because the main spiritual 'payload' here is happening outside the lines anyway. so sometimes it can end up being actually more 'potent' at lower detail levels. The magic ingredient to music boils down to just knowing the person is really there and cares (even if they care about not caring, that can work too). as we hone tighter and tighter into that, we see that actually by definition there can be no exact rule set for this. it boils down to what can be described as 'unpredictable meaningfulness'. In the search for a 'code' such as youre doing, it's almost like you're playing a game of cat and mouse whereby you narrow in on perhaps the most vital technique in creative expression, which is defying whatever guidelines youre existing in. Think about how you'd prove to your best friend that you're really you and not an impostor"

        "question": "11.13.25 2:08 pm I may have botched that transcription (and it is transcription, I'm making music, not theory). I promise I'm not in it for the chord symbols, not in the slightest. You kinda roasted me there re: the sounds the symbols represent, but it's okay, I forgive you. My songwriting intuition is somewhat worse off for my exposing myself to music that makes poor songwriting decisions that, while they still work, feel unsatisfying. You seem to have a good intuition for what feels musically satisfying, so I ask you again: C Cmaj7 Cmaj7/F Bbadd9/F Dmin9 Fmaj7/G G9 Gmin7 Gmin9no5 C13no3no5no11 C11no3 Dbadd4 Db7add#4 ____. What are my best options?",
        "answer": "let me see if i can explain what i'm seeing here........ imagine if someone said to you, \"Here is my picture so far: green, green, blue, yellow, green, purple, green ________. what is the next color that would be best for the picture\"? Even if i understand color-words perfectly, i'm still not going to have any idea what's in the picture, AND, even further, i wouldnt even know what the colors really are! because the names are never accurate enough to express the colors. but more importantly i still can't see the picture. Another analogy, someone says can you help me with my programming code, here i'll tell you the last word of each line. what to you think the last word of the next line should be. It's possible that your songwriting method differs from mine, in all fairness, but 'only chords' for me is a 1-way ticket to emptiness. and i say this even as a person who is way chord-crazy, chords are like the absolute best thing for this world, but they do absolutely nothing for me unless they are activated by melodies, words, and scenes. In the rare case where just chords are enough, then it even more is all gonna come down to the SOUND. which is not shown at all in a chord list, any more than a list of colors can represent a visual depiction of color. my best concise honest answer for the \"what comes next in this chord list\" is, as you know, drawing attention to the word/melody department. but you specifically requested that i not do that. so that's why i started to think you are really hangin on a little too tightly to these chords. seriously, for me normally on a writing session, it's a general rule of thumb let's say i wanna know, at any given moment, \"why has this run out of gas right here\"...... and i always check and yep, sure enough, it's because the chord/melody departent has gotten, even just 3 SECONDS... ahead of the words. the whole thing just becomes meaningless right there. And this is chord AND melody, and it STILL runs out of gas if the chord+mel gets ahead of the words for even just a couple seconds. what i'm saying is it would be even more extreme if JUST the chords got ahead. you'd be dead. (or at least i would). so for me this idea of writing \"just the chords\" is just one of those things that like..... doesnt work for me at all. again it's ironic that i say this because chords to me are perhaps one of the most cherished things in my tool kit. but they do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING out of context of melody at the very least, but stronger still the words OR in some cases this may be scenes, or whatever context this music is living in. salting the plate analogy, the eating pure msg analogy, i could hammer these analogies all day but you actually told me i shouldn't tell you to add words. so i was like, ok, maybe it really is about the chord list, so that's when i started looking into aesthetic options for doing things with the chord symbols, because you seemed pretty attached to those being the main thing at play here. 'if you cant beatem joinem' was sort of how i was feeling"

If you find the perfect place for something, it will feel like the thing was invented on demand for that place. but it was really the place that was found for the thing. There's a disadvantage to this, because this method of working is so addictive and so easy, there's actually a lot it can't do. such as, put down a freaking floor. which ironically is done last, ..... kicking and screaming. to this day i am still trying to figure out what's going on with that"

You mentioned you HAD some specific motivation for something at some recent point in time, and so you feel driven to find what that was, which is probably why you're asking this. so i would suggest telling the complete story about what ignited the fire to do this endeavor you're talking about. in the course of telling that story, you SHOULD, in theory, ignite a desire again, perhaps at a slightly different or similar angle from before"

The problem is simply that being on stage is so scary for you right now that you're just really scared when you're on stage.

Then i suppose years later when a card selection came up in a video, let's be honest, i wanted to say 3 of spades but maybe that would have been too direct a rip off of harry blacksone. so that's probably the reason i chose the 2. but then i was asked recently what my favorite card is and i guess the truth slipped out"

I have produced snippets of music that clicked and hold some magic however only very seldomly have I ever carried it to a sharable state.

Am I going insane here!?",

Then, suppose midway during that project you feel yourself sort of 'forgetting' how important it is to you. Then it's just a simple matter of communicating with your past self who started it, have a convo about how important this thing is, and i honestly dont know who wins this conversation but if your past self wins it means they can explain to you why the thing was so important to you and you'll buy it, and be jazzed about it again"

        "question": "can you explain to me why 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \u22ef = -1/12 I dont quite understand?",
        "answer": "ok so here's what you can do. let's look at another series, 1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1...... repeating forever. You might say that this will equal either 1 or 0, depending on where you STOP, but of course 'forever' means you never stop. you dont stop at +1, you dont stop at -1. Let's try this...... let's try 1 minus the series. subtract the series from 1. 1-(1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1.....) subtracting something in parentheses makes all the signs flip, so that's the same thing as 1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1+1-1..... so when you subtract that series from one, you get the series itself. 1 minus X equals X. what could that be, do a little algebra 1-x=x 1=2x 1/2 = x Weird, but fair, i think. 1+1-1+1-1 if you EVER stop, will equal 1 or 0 depending on when you stopped, but if you truly never stop then there is no one ever to decide whether it's 1 or 0 so it's 1/2. There are other ways of showing this series (i guess we're calling it X) equals 1/2. ok back to the other series, 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8..... let's call that one A. Consider another series, 1-2+3-4+5-6+7-8 ...... forever, the signs switching back and forth forever. let's call that B. Now let's take B plus B... but for some crazy reason because you are crazy, you decide to slide it to the right a little bit when you add it. i will leave you to decide whether or not this is a legal move. Hopefully this lines up the right way on your screen, it should be slid to the right by one number, but it's still the same series B, added to itself. 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 - 8 ...... 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 ...... ========================== 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1....... so here it appears that B plus B equals X, the series of alternating 1 and -1. which we found to be 1/2. So B plus B equals 1/2, which means B must equal 1/4. Now we'll take A minus B. 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 ..... - (1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + 5 - 6 + 7 - 8 - 9 ....) ============================= 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20 ........ which is actually 4 times A (your original series) so A minus B equals (4 times A). we already saw B equals 1/4, so A minus 1/4 = 4 times A do a little algebra A - 1/4 = 4A - 1/4 = 3A - 1/12 = A There are many many other ways of getting this result. I think the key to understanding this whole thing is the fact that you \"never stop\". If you EVER stop, let's say you're adding 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 up to a billion and you stop, you're gonna get.... a huge number, actually it would be a billion sized triangle with a billion across the bottom. but the key is you truly actually never stop. that's where the mindfuckery probably happens. if you claim to do something literally forever then the answer is gonna kind of have to be in some kind of other dimension. and this is how we can quantify it"

Highs and lows are inevitable, and even if you get everything you wished for, you'll realize you're still not ok.

        "answer": "it's a trade-off. and the same thing is true for dialogue improvisation vs scripting. Improvisation means that every moment is stamped certified genuine, impossible to feel fake. every word out of everyone's mouth, every note out of every instrument is guaranteed genuine. but as you said it can sometimes feel aimless. Writing and scripting, however, gives you a chance to really build some special things, but the sacrifice is that when you perform the thing, you're only as good as your ability to \"imitate\" how it felt when you first came up with the thing. so you're constantly fighting against the fake feeling of being a re-creation of a genuine moment that happened before. so it's a trade off"

        "answer": "for now just find another way to play it so the song still feels good. Keep in mind, as the bass player in a band playing the YMCA song, your job is not to play exactly what the original guy did on that recording session that day. Your job is to play the YMCA song, and make it feel like the party that it wants to feel like. this is your chance to be innovative, and make the song feel like this without all those extra 16th notes. you dont get any extra points for doing it the exact same way someone else did. you get party points for making the whole song altogether feel like a party, in this case. I'll give you another hint: if you are trying as hard as you can to hit those double 16th notes, and youre just barely getting it 'correct' while trying as hard as you can, guess what, it's not gonna feel good for anyone on the dance floor. but if you play a simpler version, maybe just up and down, then you'll be in a much more comfortable place to drive the party properly"

        "question": "I was recently reminded of the tremendous amount of behind-the-scenes work artists/performers/musicians put into their creations, and it hit me how often I take it for granted. And not only time and effort, but also the passion that is poured into their craft; their hearts and souls are deeply invested as well. It's so easy for me to miss that as I take in what is presented at face value. I know it sounds cringingly cliche, but the experience reminded me to be more appreciative and less critical when a creator offers to share their art with me, because it truly is a gift from the heart.",
        "answer": "true, but you also have to be honest about whether the thing works for you. there is no shame in admitting that a certain piece of work does not move you. fake appreciation can be a waste of everyone's time, and it is a hard-written law of creativity that different things work for different people, and it can even change for the same person at different times. Although, if you are talking about a situation where an artist personally presents their work directly to you, an audience of 1, and sits there in front of you while you watch it...... that's just a terribly awkward situation that i think everyone should probably avoid"

        "question": "so there's been a somewhat recent sequence of events in my life that I'm not sure what to make of. it starts with the bog-standard situation of my brain deciding to develop a crush on someone. I'm pretty shy in general, so unsurprisingly it took me forever to even get comfortable talking to her. it is here that she asks me about my crushes on campus, and after I fumble before asking her back, she tells me about her own crush that rejected her. at this point I consciously force myself to draw the conclusion that it's over. an incredibly common story now that I think about it, but for reasons I still don't understand, I decided to compose a roughly 4 minute piano piece. forever x3 later when said brain's finally gaining back some semblance of normalcy, I once again inexplicably composed. I'm not sure if the specifics are relevant to the question of \"why?\" why would I mull over sadness, let alone give it form? and why am I proud of them even though their inspiration still invokes sadness? I came across this thing once, that essentially there's infinite everythings. infinite songs, infinite memories, infinite outcomes, infinite nostalgias. it's scary. why do Ihave to choose? I may have only created them as a way of dealing with whatI felt, but why get attached to any of them if there's always infinite more?",

For example, I notice that your songs will sometimes include a statement immediately followed by its negation (eg \"i'll never say goodbye / yes i will, but i won't say it tonight\", or \"i love you / no i don't, yes i do\"), which reminds me of my own tendency/compulsion to avoid saying or thinking things that could be misinterpreted as some kind of wish that could have undesired consequences. Like forgetting to roll down the trash can on garbage day and thinking \"ugh, I wanna die\" but then immediately following it up with \"no I don't\" just in case a genie or God or something decides to grant my wish. Even if you don't suffer from that particular compulsion, are there any artifacts in your songs that resulted from some sort of superstition?",

So then I add to it, and make it bigger, and then I get halfway though the bigger project, then I think, \"I can totally do this\" and add more and then I never get anything done. This is a general pattern with my bigger projects, I tried to prevent it this time by limiting part of the project but I think I just ended up going way deeper instead of way wider. And now in the past couple weeks I couldn't even look at it anymore. I don't think it's that I have trouble finishing things, because I've finished smaller things in the past 1.5 years where I'd spend a month or a few weeks on something and put it out.

        "question": "visually do you prefer, if you understand what i'm visualizing, music notes that are under the middle note in the staff, therefore with the stem facing upwards, or notes that are on the middle line or above, with the stem facing downwards?? because i don't know why but for some reason i have a strange attachment to the notes with their stems facing down. also, when handwriting eighth notes, i draw the tail the fancy swoopy way instead of just adding a diagonal line like music teachers always do for some reason. this might also contribute to my liking of notes on the middle line or above because i like drawing that little swoopy thing curving back towards the notes with their at the end. anyway how do you hand write your eighth notes and do you like your notes on the top or bottom",
        "answer": "i just like whole notes. if you need anything faster just increase the tempo. if you hear me using 16th notes at 100bpm, for example, that's actually just whole notes at 1600bpm"

        "question": "the ostrogradsky method says you can convert an integral of type 1/W^2 where W is a binomial term with a negative discriminant into (Ax+B)/W + integral of (Cx+D)/W thus reducing a difficult integral that would require a tricky trig sub or a nasty recursive formula into a simpler one that will evaluate to some arctangent with simple transformations. The only annyoing part is finding the constants a, b, c, and d which is achieved by differentiating both sides of the initial equation (integral 1/W^2 =3D Ax+B/W + integral Cx+D/W) multiplying them by W^2, and comparing coefficients next to same terms. for some reasons my analisis class didnt teach me this and instead only showed the nasty recursive formula for situations lime these (this formula can be derived but it takes a long time and memorising it is not an option, besides this isnt what math is about). However they did show us the ostrogradsky method but exclusivly for integrals 1/sqrt(W). I recon it might have been purpesful to see who blindly learns the formula and who tries looking for a better solution by, in this case, applying a known method for a different purpose than it was taught for.I hope my professor will let me use this on an exam without having to prove this identity.",

        "question": "I watched a clip from a Weird Al Yankovic interview recently in which he said that one of the reasons why he does fewer parodies these days is that there's much less of a musical monoculture than there was a few decades ago; people now are kind of mainly listening to music that fits in the specific niche subgenres they're into, and there are few new songs these days that really \"everyone knows about\", making it more difficult to identify what songs really are hits, compared to in the 80s, when everyone\" watched MTV and knew who the biggest artists and what the biggest songs were (At least, this was my interpretation of what he said). Do you agree with this? Do you think that there's less of a centralized pop music culture than there once was, or do you think there are still songs that come out that \"everyone knows about\"?",
        "answer": "this is true if you only consider new releases, but if you are considering older releases then there is more common exposure to those than ever before"

        "question": "want a math problem i thought of? if not you can stop reading. the question is: can you play a valid game of chess where you get back to the starting position, but its BLACKs turn instead of white's in that position? if so give the moves, if not then prove it. i can come back with a hint or the answer if you want.",
        "answer": "first we can say pawns can't move because you'd never get them back. that being said, the only thing that can move is a knight, and then the rook can toggle back and forth when the knight is away. now, for the knight to return home, it must make an even number of moves, i claim. because each time the knight moves it switches to a different colored square. so for a knight to get to the same colored square it must make an even number of moves. Ok so what about the knights trading places, well for the knights to trade places, this would require an odd number of moves for each knight, still making an even number of moves in total. The only other thing to move is the rook, but this also will always be an even number of moves, because there is only one available square to toggle to. for the rook to return home it must make an even number of moves. So for everyone to return home, both sides must make an even number of moves. The problem with that: whenever it's black's turn, white has always made 1 more move han black has. which means their move totals can never be both even at the same time (unless it's white's turn). therefore this task seems to be impossible, i believe. i look forward to the humiliation of you telling me you've found a way"

        "question": "okay. the big problem of 2025 for me. i don't think i know how this works. making art. i keep trying too hard maybe, i think, probably. not sure if i'm describing this right but i keep focusing on how original (synonym for creative?)/not original the art i make is. i probably would/should instead focus on what choices i make in the art give me the most enjoyment but like.... something about all choices usually giving me just about the same enjoyment (ive talked about this before). which sometimes makes me think im not being myself by picking choices just to make them, and therefore i should probably give up and stop making art. but ive started to think that maybe this is just who i am. cause i get enjoyment from making art even if specific choices don't always excite me. hold on i got a translated hayao miyazaki quote for this.... \"i can feel it everyday, the limit of my ability. but if you said 'why don't you quit?' i'd say 'shut up'\". that's basically how i feel about making art. so wait what's the problem? oh yeah, i still don't think my art is creative. my art seems very. basic or. formulated. commercial. uncreative... gross words like that. okay and im still not sure if art is for me despite not making art sounding horrifying and depressing and also despite admitting in the first half of this text that making art is for me and gives me enjoyment. so im going in circles. i need to reconcile this. knowing who i am would be great",

Maybe it is JUST the Db I can hear which starkly contrasts with the previous Cmin11 chord but I could be missing something. What I'm really curious about is how many different notes are layered on the lyrics \"and this is what it goes like\" because it feels like a whole bunch of Db Eb and F layering the main melody but I can't pick out where exactly they appear.

        "question": "I really enjoyed the Don't you want me cover with Scary Pockets. In case of such covers, I reckon all the music is prearranged beforehand by an organizing party or someone, but I wonder if and how much freedom you had. Given the level of musicians included and the free-formity of jazz-like vibes, it seems likely (to a barely musician like myself) that you guys didn't need to play the arrangement note for note and some freedoms could be allowed. How was it in the case of drums? Were some parts added by ours truly?",
        "answer": "i will tell you exactly how it went. jack was going through a real 'hurry is the only way' mentality phase at that point. he had been brutally stuck on some projects recently and was determined that the only way out was QUICK. so it was just let's get in a room and figure it out within like 20 minutes and actually even start recording it before we've even totally figured it out. but there's also another weird story about the arrangement for that song, because they had sent me the song choices the day before (which they dont normally do, i dont know why they did.) and for some reason, and maybe this is actually a generic choice, but i had the idea to do a purdie shuffle for it, but the weird thing is when ryan picked me up at the airport he said he'd also had the same idea. so me and ryan coincidentally both thought to do a purdie shuffle for it. and then the 4-on-the-floor-reggae thing in the intro i think was my idea, because i noticed that the riff actually sounded kind of like a sort of marley riff when you re-purpose it that way. And then i think to swap in some actual 16ths at the tail end of the riff was jack's idea. But the two governing principles of all the sessions at that time, for those guys, i believe, was 1: try to make it a 'different' style from the original, and 2: wing it at breakneck speed and start recording takes before you've really figured it out"

Then, much more recently i saw some youngsters on stage doing a show and one of them threw that in (somewhat gratuitously) and gave a memetastic glance to the bandmates, and i thought to myself \"oh nice, here is some social currency that i am already familiar with. how convenient\" and since then i continue to use it both by accident and on purpose"

Could you give me some advice on how i could approach it?",

        "answer": "the word 'doubt' probably is more like youre leaning toward 'no' about something. but the word 'uncertainty' is probably less specific. it probably just means you dont know. Which makes me realize i think people probably use 'uncertain' to almost mean 'doubtful' and if you think about it that probably doesnt seem fair, from a linguistic standpoint. but as always there's surely way weirder atrocities just around the next corner, in the lagnuage"

        "answer": "i think that's a bit of storytelling and it's certainly not the only way to look at it. another way to look at it (and also not the only way), for example, is: in the past, most animals have had to brutally fight each other for survival in many ways. Nowadays, we humans still find ourselves having to do that to some degree but we are deeply devoted to keeping this at an absolute minimum, we almost unilaterally consider it 'bad', and we are becoming increasingly more ashamed about it"

I was feeling exceptionally not OK, went on YT to watch some cat videos to try to calm down, and saw one of your videos in my recommendations. I decided out of curiosity to see which of your videos were released around the time I was sick. And I found out that you posted \"if the world doesn't end\" right when I was... not quite well yet, but through the dark and experiencing the miracle that I had survived. It helped end a panic attack (so did the cats.) It's so strangely comforting. So I just wanted to thank you. Please keep being weird and amazing.

        "question": "My process is seemingly so different from yours (as I understand it). You write your songs first on paper in a quiet space, and later actually hear how it sounds on instruments, correct? Like you know in your head what it's going to sound like? To me that seems CRAZY as so much of the writing process TO ME is feeling out what chord best fits next to hit emotionally where I feel the song going, a process that I feel I could never capture abstractly to ever \"mathematically\" deduce what chord I'm looking for, you know? I'm sure much more music theory will give me more options and allow me better guesses at the next chord, but I could never write a song in my head the same way. (I say \"in my head\", but of course I mean only hearing it in my head while writing) I guess my question is... are you able to distinguish the emotional impact of the chords you choose, even when not hearing the song as you write it? Do you think of chords in that way, or is it more informed by theory? I would love some insight into that side of your process. How do you know what chords, inversions, voicings, qualities, etc are going to hit how you expect them to when you go to record a song you have written? (Of course this is all built on the assumption that I understand your writing process being done on paper first, and assuming you have all the chords written out, and a melody in mind, before actually playing any notes... please correct me if Iam wrong.) Thanks Bill, love your work :)",
        "answer": "that's one of many methods. nowadays i usually have a keyboard with me whoa whoa whoa hold on. Are you able to sit in a quiet room and write down english sentences that you'd want to say, and is there anything 'mathematical' about that? if i couldnt then it certainly would not be safe to write without an instrument. similarly, and i always use the language analogy, if you werent comfortable speaking and writing in english, it would be impossible to coherently write things, such as your question, without speaking them. but, again, like the language analogy, this takes YEARS of experience. this is not something that a person can do in their first few weeks of learning, let's say, their first language. or even their second for the above reasons that question makes no sense to me. i suppose that would strike me as an enormous 'false dichotomy' the same way you know what words to use, which, as i always say, is quite a miracle. the imagination is mysterious and powerful"

Why does it feel like modern songs are just composed of simple loops and lyrics, rather than feeling like every part of the song is unique?",
        "answer": "there's a lot to unpack here. first, the golden rule. what one listener might find 'useless and repetitive', another listener might find totally enthralling. and, for a different song, those same two listeners' opinions might even be reversed. totally separate question, do music artists sometimes try to fill out the runtime of songs just because they think it 'should' fill up that much time; probably yes some people do that and i'd be of course wholeheartedly against that and i lecture against it frequently. part of a general anti-should worldview that i probably have, when it comes to creativity. (\"should i do this, should i do that, whats the 'correct' way\", art suffocates when asked these questions. either it's driving you wild or it's not.) then thirdly you indicated that you are feeling that songmakers currently seem to be generally not living up to your expectations of them. It is perfectly natural and normal to feel this way. And what i always strongly advocate is: use this frustration to fuel your inspiration to do it better. If you truly believe you are onto something that 'most other songmakers' are not, ..... then, ... my goodness what a huge gift that is. this is exactly the kind of scenario that can inspire a whole career"

        "question": "this is going to sound incredibly stupid, but. somewhere along the way i mentally tied my physical appearance (especially my youth) to my \"deserving\" to create art. I made a bit of music i liked, and as i was listening to it i looked in the mirror and saw someone with burgeoning forehead wrinkles and a receding hairline looking back at me, and suddenly i felt like i dont deserve to make art and that it only belongs to people that still have their youth. it felt like i needed to give up on art and just get a boring job and try and start a family or whatever. i understand this is stupid and based on societal expectations and recognizing patterns of young attractive people making music and old people working normal jobs. but. its really affecting my ability to conceptualize myself making art in the future. I keep imagining myself at like 47 strumming the same stupid guitar and playing the same chords and i feel so infantile. i really respect how committed you are to making art for as long as you can be alive, and i feel the same way, it just feels so stupid to have a hang up like this interfere with what i'd ostensibly thought was my life's mission. maybe if im weak enough to let something like aging bother me this much then i wasn't cut out for making art. i dont know. maybe you've felt something similar? sorry about this stupid rambling non-question vent session. also im 23 years old yeah yeah yeah cue laugh track i know i know im young. i just feel old as balls",
        "answer": "if i may tell you the opposite side of the story, people who are young and attractive sometimes find themselves in a peculiar situation where they find they have to work twice as hard to convince people they actually have real talent. sometimes they feel they need to overcome the perception that their success is based on looks alone if youre bored with strumming that particular guitar then that has nothing to do with age. if youre having these thoughts then it almost seems like you might be bored with it now already there are so many different ways to go about all these life issues, i dont even think i could list them all. but it seems pretty standard that the biggest and brightest stars of creativity have certainly suffered at least the same insecurities as you've felt. but it seems like this sets up a nice pit of misery to rebel against. which is exactly what your work needs to make it come alive"

        "question": "so i was making some.... shoddy fuckn 2d vid instead of the 3d like i was hopin ykno, cause like the vid was due in.... i dunno a few weeks or maybe days at that point? cant remember. so something about me is that i have an incredible amount of confidence that i can get anything i want to done, in basically any amnt of time. but ths time i was overly ambitious, and at least a little bit stupid. accepted some things i shouldnt have. and with limited 3d experience under my belt i decided to take on 30s of animation, planning to do it 3d. and they needed a bit more help so i volunteered to take on 30s more. now at the time i was really interested in learning maths and physics, and i had to help out the fam with some stuff. so that took up a lot of my time. and i was planning on doing everything; modeling and rigging characters, setting up env stuff, animating it all, everything. but then i realised nearing the due date that i may not be as superhuman as i thought. and they also were rushing me a bit and i felt increasing anxiety that id never get the video done and theyd be disappointed in me. so i spent the whole of 2 days quickly doing a minute of 2d animation with only some 3d scenes where i felt it didnt look out of place. but it's like fuckin hell, i didnt try hard enough. i probably couldve done it if i took it more seriously. i kept sleeping and doing other stuff. i feel guilty for giving some half heartedly made, botched video to these people instead of giving the best animation i could",

        "question": "Rarely, I'll come up with short songs or tunes, and I'll record me humming them so that I don't forget them. Now I find myself wanting to have them recorded on piano or something so that they exist in a more realized form, but to do that it seems like I'd have to buy a keyboard, learn how to play it, and practice a bit just to get a dozen short tunes. I'm not necessarily interested in playing piano in any other capacity, so it'd be a lot of work for something that I feel should be simple, am I missing some easier way to just get a realization of these songs? Thanks in advance, love your stuff.",
        "answer": "if you try to do 10 steps at once (or as you called it, \"a lot of work\" and some procedures you described) it probably wont work out the way you expected. i think it's very important to work your way into these things one reasonable step at a time. similar to the way i described a few questions down about how you wont know exactly how to fly the ship until after a few hundred episodes"

        "answer": "i'll tell you exactly what that is. it's a song ending. it's a very strange thing for a song to end. when you're in the song, the song is the whole world. but eventually the song has to end and you have to transition into the world outside of that song. so song endings, at least for me, often have this weird shocking quality to them, kind of like a vestubule of a building, or a decompression chamber. or that space between the inner and outer wrapper, on a loaf of bread. nevermind, better metaphor, it's like the song is dying. the song ends, so the ending of songs often sounds like the song is being killed. that way a plausible next move for the song at that point would be to no longer be playing"

        "question": "disclaimer: this might come off as more of an existential rant than a question. i love how into songwriting you are. you are among the only people on earth that i really resonate with when they talk about it. but then again, one thing differentiates us two. you actually do it. you put out songs. i understand everything you're talking about when answering these questions, i feel as if i percieve it the same way you do, sometimes i even console myself saying it's what i live for, yet i still don't make music. you give beautiful inspiring insights, yet i still can't regularly put them to use. it means so much to me that it scares me out of it. and it's this constant cycle of wanting it too much and not wanting it enough. sometimes i catch myself in the middle ground with the guitar in my hand but that middle ground is so unpredictable and it throws me off every time it comes by me. it's so short as well. it leaves me dazed, journaling for so long in attempt to uncover what made me land at the sweet spot. i almost always get too self conscious before anything worth sharing feels complete, yet it always gives me a little hope. but it's been 6 years... i've been officially in love with music for the last 6 years. 4 of which i have been in this stagnant state. i convince myself i dont need it. i judge myself when i see others succeed. how do i actually get myself to actually and consistently do it??? how do i balance out wanting it too little and too much on a regular basis??? i love creating so much it genuinely, literally hurts when i'm not doing it. and most of the time i'm not doing it. i'm sorry if this is a bit intense, i don't mean to burden you with any emotions. but if you have any wisdom to share with me, it would be greatly appreciated. thank you for everything you do by the way",

        "question": "do you remember the way some songs were written when they become relevant to a specific moment in your life? eg. \"just did a bad thing\", and coping with the fact that you just did a bad thing by remembering your written wisdom on the subject of doing a bad thing",
        "answer": "actually what happened on that one was i had narrowed it down to about 20 choices for which song (or song idea) was going to be the next one to finish and record, and that was one of them. it was certainly not my favorite, but it must not have been my least favorite because it made the top 20. that idea itself is not related to any particular bad thing or other, it's just a song idea which i apparently thought was cool when i came up with it. and slightly cool when i picked it for the top 20. Then i started narrowing it down by eliminating ones from the 20, that was probably one of the first to get eliminated, then i kept eliminating them and eventually i got it down to 1, but i didnt really want to do that one either, so i eliminated that one as well. I just sort of frustratedly shrugged and said \"well that wasn't the point\", and i un-eliminated all of them and then just quickly chose the \"bad thing\" one, because it was kind of the one that felt the weakest. because the point is that it shouldn't matter which song you choose, any idea can be made good. And the truth is, it can actually be very energizing to work with a weaker idea, because it makes the creative engine turn on stronger, to compensate. and that's certainly what i noticed, after getting started on it and writing the next 8 bars or so. so sometimes i refer to the \"bad thing\" as the fact that i accidentally eliminated all of my choices and ended up going with the weakest one. Other times, i tell the story that the \"bad thing\" was that i spent simultaneously too much and too little time on the production of the song, and accidentally spent the exact right amount of time, but that's another story"
