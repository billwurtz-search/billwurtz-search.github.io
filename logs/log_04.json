        "question": "Can you maybe lend a hand with this? I can sight read rhythms fine when it's just combinations of whole/half/quarter/8ths/16th notes (with rests or dots or ties or whatever)... But I get thrown off whenever triplets (or some kind of tuplet) comes in to play. I can clap out quarter note triplets or eighth note triplets over a click, but when it comes in the middle of a measure, or on an offbeat, or if there's only just one or two (instead of 3) of the triplets or if you have the triplets tied together with other notes, or a quarter note triplet paired with an eighth note triplet... all that kind of stuff just throws me off. I guess I kind of internalized the triplets in groups of 3 (three 8th note or 3 quarter note triplets in a line starting on the downbeat) and when they don't fall like that, I just can't feel the rhythm. Do you have any tips for how to count this stuff, or better yet just like how to internalize the feel of the notes to make them c ome more easy and natural? Ideally, I just want to get to the point where I can just feel it and play it naturally and don't have to be counting continuously in my head when trying to read. Just like when playing for fun, or making my own music I'm feeling the pulses of the bar, but I'm not counting all the subdivisions just letting the rhythms come naturally. I feel like I'm probably using all these tuplets a lot in my own playing and not even realizing when I'm doing it.",
        "answer": "if you are familiar with the \"1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &\" system for counting 8th notes, or the \"1e&a2e&a3e&a4e&a\" system for counting 16th notes, imagine a system of \"1-trip-let-2-trip-let-3-trip-let-4-trip-let\" for counting triplets. this should help you subdivide. for example, the sort of west african triplet clave rhythm would be 1 _ let (2) trip-let (3) _ let (4) _ _. write out some random combinations of triplets, and practice counting like this. maybe even go to random dot org and get a string of 12 binary digits, and say the 1's are where the notes are and the 0's are where the spaces are. write it out as triplets (that will give you writing practice) and then read it (that will give you reading practice.)"

        "question": "1.29.18 2:07 pm Hey, just want to say thanks! I tried your suggestion and randomizing the hits/rests with the triplets has been super helpful. I also have this app on my phone that's like a metronome but you can plug in the specific rhythm notation, so I've been doing that to check to make sure my timing is good. Couple more questions about this whole thing. Are triplets almost always going going to be grouped in 3's? Maybe its not really common cause I'm not seeing it in any of my sheet music, but would you ever see something like one eighth note/rest triplet just by itself immediately followed by a 'regular', non-triplet note/rest? And will triplets almost always start right at the top of the beat, like would you ever see 3 quarter note triplets, but starting on the \"and\" of the beat? How would you count out stuff where you kind of have to subdivide a single beat into 3's as well as into 2's or 4 's for regular eighth or sixteenth notes? (sorry if this is all jumbled, I hope you understand what I mean though).",
        "answer": "heads would explode, that would simply not be readable by any normal human something to that effect could happen, on a larger scale, for example you could have quarter note triplets starting on beat 2 or 4. but effectively what that would be is 8th note triplets hitting every other one. for example, take the percussion/hi-hat accents in that song 'everybody wants to rule the world' that's doing this. it would be not practical to write it as quarter note triplets, you would want to write that as 8th note triplets alternated with 8th note rests, starting with a rest, and lining up with the downbeats on 2 and 4"

        "question": "You say that you almost always write lyrics and the vocal melodies together.. but what about songs like la de da or outside that have multiple verses where the vocal melody is more or less the same? (Or maybe you meant that you never really write lyrics without a vocal melody in mind). I usually write the lyrics with the melody too and they both kind of feed one another. But I always hit a wall when trying to fit lyrics to a pre-set melody (like for the 2nd/3rd verse of a song). The lyrics seem more forced and unnatural when I'm trying to fit them in a place instead of making the place around them. I'll have a good verse 1 then the other verses kind of drop off. Any tips?",
        "answer": "it can be kind of a puzzle, but it should come to you in the right circumstances. do a timed run through of what you have so far, and listen very very closely when you reach the end of that run through. that is really only the authentic time when the answer should hit you, and it will feel like lightning. the more you sit there the less likely it will be to happen, and you need to take a deep breath, walk around the room, and do another run through. the answer is most likely to hit you after hearing the song properly in the right order at the right speed up until that point. pay very very close attention as you get to the end of the run through, that is when you are going to hear the answer. and when writing a second verse, don't forget that you are allowed to make adjustments to make the second time a little different"

        "answer": "you can talk like that and it can be fun and useful, but there will never be an actual categorization system that works. try putting more than 3 songs into it and you'll break the system every time any song can have similarities and differences with any other song. even itself! i can already think of 100 different things those words mean. which makes it fun to use those words, but not reliable whatsoever for any scientific means. just for play it can be fun for entertainment purposes but no matter what system you use, it will break as soon as you add more than 2 songs. i think it's actually music's job to break these systems. if it weren't, then where's the fun, you know. i think often people who don't make music like to think these systems are somehow supposed to be reliable, which makes for an interesting game of cat and mouse which the mouse will always win"

Did you read a lot of books for it? Or is there some sort of online course you could take? What would you recommend for someone like me who doesn't have the time or money to go to any music school, but desperately wants to have the know-how to make good quality music using all the tools that are available to me beyond just \"sounding good\"?",
        "answer": "it depends what you mean by music theory maybe a few, but the learning only takes place when you are sitting there at an instrument and trying the stuff i'm sure there are zillions the only way to learn how to make good quality music is to spend as much time as possible listening, playing, trying stuff, play with others if possible, etc. If you're talking about literacy, then you just gotta learn what the names of the notes are, etc. and that part is easy. i mean, i will tell you the names of the notes, i'll tell you what anything's called, just ask. (keep in mind, many things can be called different things in different parts of the world) but if try to ask me about rules of music i can't help you. the whole reason music exists in the first place is due to rule breaking"

        "question": "Have you ever used one of those sinks where you turn the tap ever so carefully and slowly, it budges just a tiny bit and water just explodes out of the faucet, spraying everywhere and making a huge mess? Well, that's the story of my life right now. I have so many ideas and directions I want to go with music that I can't get anything done. Like, the other week I was listening to prelude to the afternoon of a faun and I was thinking how I'd love to learn orchestration and arranging and write these beautiful, epic symphonic poems. But I also LOVE prince and p funk and james brown, and I want to just devote my life to making the funkiest music ever. But I'll watch some of your videos and I love your score-writing and how you sync up music and visuals so well and how that's such a powerful tool and it makes me want to learn animation and video-making. But then I listened to some paul simon, and it's like, maybe I just want to get my acoustic guitar and ju st write some nice songs. Then I'll hear some top 40 radio and it makes me want to write really fun, upbeat, catchy bubblegum-y tunes. But my first love, the thing that made me want to be a musician was blues, and there's always a part of me that just wants to just be a blues guy... I can go on forever and write a novel about the music I want to make, and I'm being pulled in so many different directions. I'll get really motivated to do something, until I have another idea that makes me pull a 360 and want to do something entirely different. I have all these lofty goals and dreams and things I want to accomplish, but I can't stop time and do everything all at once. More than anything I want to be PROLIFIC. I want a vast library of music. But I can't commit to any one thing because nothing stands out above the rest for what direction I want to go, and what I want to devote myself too. My compass is spinning around. I'll sit at the piano or pick up my guitar to write and can't even foc us on on e thing for more than a few minutes. I'll start working on one thing, and then without even thinking, my brain switches gears and I'll be trying to do something entirely different. Every time I turn on that sink to fill my cup, the water gushes all over the place and I drop the cup and it shatters and I'm left with a spray of water everywhere, but no water in my cup to drink (or to give to others to drink). I've taken a page out of your book and have been really serious about documenting and recording every idea so nothing falls through the cracks... But I just don't know what to do next. Do you have any advice you can share with me? I'm about to explode.",

        "question": "why dont you tell anyone what software you use for stuff??? like, the 3d stuff, WHAT DO YOU USE? prolly blender, right?",
        "answer": "blender was the first one that was recommended to me, and it was the first one i tried. i was very impressed with it at first, but i realized something shocking and i had to leave. and i am still puzzled by it, on an existential level, even though i don't use it. here's what happens: when you export something to video, there is no dialog box to name it, and it overwrites previous exports if the name is the same. and the name is the same by default. let me explain this again. when you export something, if you just click export, it will export it with the same name as your previous export and replace the previous export. if you want it to not do that, you have to open up a thing, then type a name, and then save. and it will not warn you if the name is the same as another. so if you export many many many different things during your process, which i do and i suspect most people do, you basically would have to remember to open that up every single time and type a new name, AND manually keep some sort of list of all the names you used and make sure you never use the same name twice. That would be like if you had a camera that saved every picture as \"picture\" by default, and it wiped out any previous picture named 'picture' every time you took a picture without re-naming it. so not only do you have to name your picture every time but you have to remember all the names you've ever used, so as to not risk deleting a picture. i searched and searched and i could not find an explanation for why the program is this way, or just simply how you would go about this without living in a state of mind fucktastrophy. oh and by the way there's no save dialog and it's easy to quit accidentally. so there's that too"

        "question": "if you've already recorded reality and notebooks quite a while ago how come you wait until a long time has passed since you wrote them to post them",
        "answer": "for reality: 1. i need to search through thousands of hours to find and put together clips that are good. 2. need to make video for them 3. the more time has passed since the original recording date, the more opportunity i have to use stronger foreshadowing, and include things that are much more meaningful, and relate so much stronger to future events for notes: i didn't have this website when i made the majority of the good stuff, and it's taken a while to get up the courage to post some of the deeper crazier stuff. in the time since 2014, i've mainly just been writing things for twitter, and i do include some of that stuff on the notes page, but people tend to complain that it's too short (twitter has a length limit, so it's fine for twitter and those were written for twitter) and they make a good point. they are for twitter. so i'm not really concerned with those. generally when it comes to much longer notes, that was mostly an outlet to express creativity while i was still figuring out how to actually record full blown songs, with lyrics, with vocals, with all instruments, and with video, all entirely by myself. now that i know how to do that, that is where i spend most of my time. but there are still hundreds, perhaps thousands (depending on how you divide it) of note items which i am releasing gradually, all dated according to when it was written, as always. there are probably 10x as many notes now as there were in 2014, even if you only count the ones before 2014"

Dividing 2 by 1/2 is 4, by 1/3 is 6, etc. In other words, the smaller the fraction, the higher the multiplication. Extrapolating, you can see that dividing by zero is (abstractly) the same as multiplying by infinity. So dividing by zero doesn't give you a real answer because infinity is an abstract concept (whereas numbers are abstract concepts that can have sort-of tangible real-life equivalents). Why don't you ever use capital letters?",

        "question": "How come almost everyone would say that a song is in the key of C# instead of the key of Db, but the key of Eb as opposed to the key of D# seems to be the norm, or F# instead of Gb etc? I know the chord name or even the note name will change depending on what key you're in. Nobody would say that Ab is the 3rd of Emajor because you go up the scale alphabetically and you don't want two A's (Ab and A natural)... Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems to me the names of key signatures themselves, are kind of set in stone for the most part Like, if I played you a song in Bb and asked you what key it was in... wouldn't you say Bb instead of A#? Or is that just me?",
        "answer": "if it's major it is usually called Db, because that's less degrees in the key signature. but in a loud room, it might be better to verbally say \"C#\" because if you say Db they might think you said Bb right, that's because D# major spelled out properly with letters would have to be D#, E# Fx(double sharp), G#, A#, B#, and Cx(double sharp) F# and Gb are equivalent choices because they each have 6 degrees in the key signature, but it may be more often called F# for two reasons. one is kind of like the C#/Db case where F# is more verbally clear in a crowded room, but also it is more common for keys to borrow flatter notes than sharper ones. which creates no problems at all in F# where as in Gb it immediately creates double flats. actually i can think of a 3rd reason. F# as a note would be much more common than Gb because F# is the first note to go, in sharp keys. where as in flat keys Gb is is the 5th note to go. so people are already more accustomed to verbally hearing the words \"F#\" than Gb that's right only when the choice is obvious that's an extremely obvious case. Bb only has 2 flats where as the key of A# major would have 10 sharps. spelled out would be A#, B#, C double sharp, D#, E#, F double sharp, G double sharp"

        "answer": "i think this is a common technique when there is a lot of readable content on a shirt. if it's on the front no one will ever be able to fully read it without the wearer patiently watching you read it. when it's on the back it is much more likely to be read, particularly by people waiting/standing in line (in a line, on line, on a line, on a queue, etc) behind the wearer. for example i think those t-shirts with tour schedules always have it on the back because it greatly increases the chances it will be read and studied by strangers, closely enough to make plans to go to the show. if the information were on the front i think it could not be studied carefully without creating a very awkward moment betweenst the viewer and the wearer"

I have the main part down, but I'm trying to overdub other instruments (all using the keyboard) and it's tricky. I'm having a real hard time adding parts on top because there's no defined rhythm to use as reference. I tried giving it a set tempo, just really slow, and figuring out what the rhythm could be.. but when I do that, it sounds more rigid and stiff and kind of changes the vibe of the thing. Have you ever recorded anything that had multiple tracks, but no defined beat or rhythm?",

        "question": "As much as I love jazz, I have never been able to \"acquire\" a taste for overly dissonant parts that somehow become recognied by music buffs as genius. So I wholeharedtly agree with your approach of focusing on the way music \"sounds\", but you seem to have an excellent grasp of theory, and this is why so many of your fans ask for tips on studying, yet you are often dismissive of such questions. I just wanted to let you know that you're a hero among aspiring musicians, and we just want to know if you have any tips on how to learn all the rules, even if it means we have to break them every now and then.",
        "answer": "depending on when and where you get out of your time machine, jazz might just mean pop. or it might mean background music that is easy to listen to, and not for geniuses. it might mean a car, or even a basketball team. jazz means so many things there is almost no way to tell what someone means when they say it. sounds like what you meant is nerd music you can try to make a music theory, but the music is only going to find a new way to evade the theory. happens every time, it's the darndest thing i am not. i tell them very clearly what i think the best strategy is. i've said it hundreds of times here, over and over, and i will continue to say it until you start getting it i feel like i've spent hundreds of hours explaining this over and over again, and it feels like people never seem to quite get it. we're talking about something malleable, like hot soft clay. it can be molded into absolutely any position. maybe the reason i can never quite get people to understand this this is because it is firm enough that it will stay where it was molded, briefly, for a hot 5 seconds, but as soon as you so much as turn away or go into another room, the whole thing can and will change on you. which is by the way the biggest part of the fun"

I'd really appreciate your response",
        "answer": "the 7 is supposed to go after the m, otherwise it actually looks like it means something different, because of some quirks about the way 7's are used when writing chord symbols. but the 7 means there's another note you have to have. Cm7 includes Bb note, and so on. Cmaj7 includes B note, and so on. 'C7maj' is unfortunately not clear as to what it means and this is due to a quirk about what just C7 means (hint, it might not be which 7 you'd expect) you can do it by feel"

        "answer": "yes, although watch out for calling it 'diminished' because diminished usually is about b5. and 'minor' is usually about b3. when saying the 7 is lowered it's probably best to say 'flat 7' (b7) C(b7) yes. watch out, Cb7 actually looks like it means Cb(7), like B7. for example Bb7 means Bb(7) not B(b7) watch out for that, 'diminished' is associated with the 5. when you say Cm7 is diminished it sounds like you mean it has b5 but it does not right. minor or major refers to the 3, but Cmaj7 has a maj7 by association and Cmin7 has a min7 (flat 7) by association. The only weird part is when you say C7 it means major third, but flat 7. that's just what it means. (it's shorthand for C dominant 7, and the word dominant doesn't make any sense there but that's just what it's called) it's just a weird quirk of spelling, like spelling quirks in english or other languages"

        "question": "3.20.18 3:57 am \"C Db, D#, E, Gb, G#, Bb\". the same notes as Db melodic minor but starting on C.",
        "answer": "if it were me i'd just say whole tone with the D flipped out to Db and D# instead, IF those notes you listed were the exact notes i needed. probably a lot of people would say altered but i just think there is ambiguity surrounding those situations, both in the terminology and in the reality. in places where the 'altered' scale is typically used, in your key, it would be like if you're on a C7(\"alt\")(which could mean anything from b9 to #9 to +5) about to go to Fmin. and i think in reality your strongest notes are going to be Db, Eb, Bb, Ab, E, and then i'd say tied for the next lesser level of priority would be like F and G, and furthermore this entire umrella of chord scenarios (the C7\"alt\" to Fmin) in general is very friendly to dense chromatic passing tones, so the remaining notes will immediately go onto the table. this has included some of the notes not in your scale, and also i might add that i think Gb is least likely to be a good choice, actually quite frankly i don't think Gb would belong in the 'altered' scale, if we're talking about what really is strongest for most of the situations where 'alt' is written in the chord symbol. as you study a lot of tunes from the same time period, same composer, etc., you may notice them consistantly using a certain type of 'dark' V7 chord (C7 going to Fmin, in our key) and 'alt' may seem like a friendly concept within the context of one particular time period or composer, but as you travel from decade to decade you'll notice that the 'typical' scenarios become slightly different, and yet still pronounced. some calling strongly for the C7b9, or others more strongly calling for #9 and +5. just when you think you have found the archetypical type within a certain time period or sector of music, move just a few steps and you will find it's different and yet also seemingly archetypical. but i would like to repeat something i said earlier which is sure you can absolutely call your series of notes by either of the 2 previous names first mentioned in the original question, they are perfectly justified names. but be ready to clarify what notes you want if the person says 'what'"

        "question": "so i was recording vocals in my living room the other day and i got all these different hums going on. went on the internet and somebody said that those are natural harmonics being produced in nature and that those happen in multiples and you gotta EQ them out. so i go to EQ the point that i think the problem is at then i see that there's also a problem with another number, which i can only surmise means that there are also problems with all the multiples of that. i could throw another EQ thing on the track and get rid of those too but i feel like at that point i'm killing the life of the track. so i talked to a dude about this and he said \"the acoustics in that room are shitty, those are called standing waves, you can fix that by putting absorber pads on your wall.\" i knew what he was talking about cuz youtube's been targeting pad ad's to me for a while now. anyway, my question is how do YOU deal with the acoustics in whatever room you record vocal s in, if you do at all. if you feel more comfortable emailing about this i wouldn't mind. i just feel like i fucked that up, so, yeah.",
        "answer": "they might not know what is going on without actually hearing your recording that might be true my room is almost entirely carpeted. that helps a lot. if you have a mostly non-carpeted room you are screwed. also there is a lot of stuff in here, which helps. there are pictures on the walls, etc. there is just a lot of stuff in here. there is actually a very small sound absorbing pad that i put on a blank spot on the wall but i think the effects are probably negligible. the sound seems to be ok but i've been noticing more lately that it's not perfect. someone actually once told me they thought i put reverb on the narration vocals on history of japan, but not the jingle vocals. this is backwards, there is no reverb on the narration, but a little bit on the jingles. what this tells me is that the natural room acoustics are audible on the narration because there is much less other music to mask it. but during the jingles, or full musical arrangements, it is not audible"

        "question": "I'm working on a song right now. I wrote it a long time ago (well not so long if we're using geological scale) and never really payed any attention to it, but one time one musician heard it's unfinished version and said that it is a very great song, and a very lame performance. As I am clinically crazy, I started to work on it from the beginning and saw it's \"true\" potential. It's a song about trying to escape from reality by going, walking far away. Walking home, searching home. But I can't make it right. Right now it is almost 8 minutes long, and boring for everybody but me. Kind mister, please advice me. How to make those 8 minutes The Eight Minutes? How to make a masterpiece out of something that might touch only my puny schizo hearth? Should I just climb this mountain? There is probably no use in me writing this and I'm still a piece of garbage, but I won't write it so I'm free to do it XD I just look for some inspiration. .. By the way I love your work, it helped me through some harder times yesterday, and it always touches my puny hearth deeply :)",
        "answer": "you are probably asking the wrong person. i have a general rule not to make songs longer than 4 minutes. for something longer, i think it needs visual elements, maybe some story telling, many more things outside of just being a song. that's just what i've learned from experience. that doesn't mean you can't make a longer song with audio only, but it's not something i have any advice for. my first advice would make it much more than a song and use visual and story telling elements"

        "question": "Hi Bill, My ex-girlfriend and I broke up (we're still good friends though). She said that I became more awkward around her in person and she didn't want to ruin our relationship. I told her that I completely understood, but in all honesty, I hate myself for fucking up what we had together. I don't know why I became so awkward around her in person, and it really irritates me that I messed up with her, because I really did love her. I just didn't want to come off as clingy and weird in public. I'm kind of a shy and quiet person most of the time, and it takes me a while to warm up to someone and show them the real me. The only reason I didn't show her the love and affection that she deserved in public is because we only really see each other in school, and I didn't want anyone looking at me strangely. I get embarrassed and nervous easily, and I would have been panicking in my head if people looked and laughed at me while I was being affectionate t owards h er. The real issue here is that I still have feelings for her. I miss what we had together. I want to try again and be less awkward around her, but I feel like she'll turn me down this time because she might find someone else or I might fuck it up again. I don't know if I'll ever find a girl like her again. I feel like a hopeless piece of shit. What do I do to make myself feel better in a time like this?

Metchnikoff believed that cellular immunity protected animals from infection while Von Behring led the school of thought that held that humoral immunity was primarily responsible for vertebrate immunity. We now understand that both cellular and humoral immunity must be tightly coordinated to mount a proper immune response. Discuss the components involved in the activation of an immune response describing their functions, coordination with other components, and whether or not the component is part of the innate or acquired response. Finish your discussion by explaining the mechanisms that modulate the immune response such that autoimmune disorders are the exception rather than the rule.",

I have a couple concerns, first is that I'm extremely scared of making any moves whatsoever, partly out of fear of rejection but also because I think she is way too perfect for me. Personally, I feel like an ugly sack of shit compared to her which is the opposite of encouragement. Do you have any advice for me? Thanks",

        "question": "HUGE musical breakthrough after a year of progress. tell me if i'm onto something here. so there's the feeling of home, familiarity. let's say that's a chord. now that's got certain notes in it, and is either a Major chord, which is good vibes, or Minor, which is usually a feeling of evil or sadness. But whether we're happy or sad, home is home. Now, if our next chord is what we expect it to be, using a lot of the same notes as the first chord, then that's not much of an adventure. but if all of the sudden we're playing very unexpected notes, that can have this otherworldly vibe. i discovered this by playing a D minor chord followed by a B major. because I've already played the D and the F without making it sharp or flat, you really wouldnt expect me to flip it on it's head and make both the D and the F sharp. so it feels like we've learned something new and extraordinary, especially because the B is Major compared to the unhappy minorness of home. a m i gett ing somewhere?",

I dont want to stop playing because there are some good people in the same program as me and it is the only thing that i do. I leave school at 5 everyday and have 3 rehearsals a day. i dont think im great with rhythms, no matter how easy they are i mess up. i dread going to rehearsal everyday and i dont know what to do. i thought this is what i wanted to do with my life but now i dont want to look at sheet music ever again, i feel trapped. i cant talk to my family about this and my friend doesnt care about music and doesnt understand, what would you do if you were in this situation?",

I kind of have to have something, even if it's just a few bars, to work off of. Do you ever sit down and try to write a song from scratch.. as in, just sitting at the piano with nothing in mind (apart from the improv page, I guess)? Or do you usually wait for a melody idea or something to come to you (wherever and whenever that may be), and then start writing off of that idea?",
        "answer": "me too i know what you mean yes. it can be done i am very diligent about capturing ideas whenever they fall on me, because this is just how ideas tend to occur. so a large amount of starting points from songs actually come from those ideas that fall on me at an unexpected time and place. it is very important to meticulously catch all these ideas as they fall on you. generating ideas from a blank desk can be done but it is only part of the picture"

But it sounds better the original way. this ever happen to you? i think i should probanly just not care and if anyone has a problem with it they can just stuff it, right? it is ironic because i am getting caufht up on this small part of the song which proves what i was singing",

I get that songs and videos are totally priority right now.. but, I don't know, think you'll take a week or 2 and maybe throw some more stuff on those other pages every now and then? I've seen another similar question where you said that you'll do that stuff (I think the question was talking about the reality page specifically) when you feel like 'it's a good idea to delay your main projects' or something like that, im paraphrasing... but that answer makes it sound like you never want to do it, which I'm guessing isn't the case?",
        "answer": "of course i could take 100 years and still never finish i want to do it more than anything. which is what makes it so painful each day, because the only way to do it would be to put everything else on pause"

There some variations in the middle of the song too. Playing the way i said is too repetitive, i don't want to bore the listeners. Thanks",

I do my works anonymously since i don't like having my face and real name online, but they haven't respected that and call me by my real name in the comment sections of my posts. What should I do about them?",

Or do you have each part pretty much in your head before going into it?",

        "answer": "i've just been familiar with them for so long i don't have a strategy. but i will teach you one to get you started, forgive me if you already know this one, and if you do i will tell you the next one. but the chord is called C major, or just \"C\" for short. and it is when you play the notes C, E, and G, at the same time, somewhere in the middle range of the keyboard (it doesn't count if you play all 3 notes in the bass range, that is just called mud. if there are any notes in the bass range it should be just 1 and it should be the C note.) so again this is called C major, or \"C\" for short. if middle C is on the bottom, that's fine. if middle C is in the middle, with G under it and E above it, that is fine (there might also be C in the bass range as well). it might be middle C on top, with G and E right under it (that is probably about as low as you might go for the C chord). it could be higher, with E330(hz) then G and C above it. all these combinations are still called C, or C major. (C as a chord automatically means C major.) I hope that is enough to get you started, forgive me if you already knew all that. if you want to know more i will tell you"

        "question": "I'm sure people ask your for help on this all the time... but, my biggest number 1 road block to being more productive with writing more songs is hands-down lyrics. I know you say to write words together with music and I've always tried to do that, and I've even played around with that random word generator... but lyrics are like a giant fucking anchor tied to me. I can never come up with words that I'm happy with. So I have all these songs that are pretty much finished, but the vocal melody is just like humming or scat singing with some random phrases here and there thrown in. It's like the things I most want to express are the things that are hardest for me to put into words, and I've never been much for writing poetry and stories and stuff, which I know is a different ball game than lyric writing.. but still, I've never considered myself a 'writer'... writing words has just never been my strong suit creatively. I feel like if I could just get more comfort able with lyrics, then I could churn out songs like a machine. But I always second guess myself and I'm afraid I sound too cheesy or cliche or that people will laugh at me or make fun of me or whatever... Can you help?",

I'd love to be able to take video clips and give them a musical score where everything is in sync with the dialogue/action of what's going on the video (like if someone's walking downstairs I could have percussion hits that match the footsteps exactly, etc) are there any tricks to this?",
        "answer": "my strategy is to make all the music myself. i understand that might not be everyone's cup of tea, because it is demanding and takes hard work, but the benefits are out of this world one good trick is to press record (with your clip synced up) and watch it and just sort of play it, after. with the right timing. so just as soon as you see the action, look away from the screen and imagine what you just saw in your head and play it synced to that, so it will be timed right, but just a bit delayed. then just go in and move it. if it's not quite right, just do it again. or if it's midi then just nudge notes to fit. fuck it, nowadays you can nudge audio notes too anyways Like how in your non-song vids youll have little musical cues and effects that sync up perfectly in time to graphics that are flashing on the screen or whatever.. Do you try thinking of the video as being at a certain bpm/time signature and using that for knowing when to come in, or is it just about watching the video a bunch of times and doing a bunch of takes until you get the timing right? Eventually, I wanna learn how to do animation and make my own videos, but I want to work on the music-side first by just setting music to clips from old movies or any other random stuff I can find."

Sometimes it's obvious if you just have the stack of thirds (1,3,5,7,9,11,13)... but what about when the chord isn't built in numerical order like that? For example, I have this song where for an E7 I play the notes D F# G# B (all in the same octave).. would that just be called E9 even though there's no root and the F# isn't in a higher octave?",
        "answer": "whichever one you are used to seeing in that situation and hopefully they won't be most of the time in that case it's called E9. at least where i'm from, it is understood to include the 7, whenever you use a number 7 or higher. where as if you had said 2, it is implied that there is no 7. E9 is a well known chord and it is well known to mean dominant 9 which means it includes 7 (D) and F#, and G#. it's all case by case. some chords have acheived written popularity under certain names"

What do you expect, when self-loathing and internal restlessness are recurring themes in your music? To that, you'll say - Oh, but my lyrics aren't autobiographical!

The overall emotional tone of that whole page is negative. And there's nothing wrong with that! But it explains why everyone thinks you're depressed. Hopefully that settles this issue once and for all, and we can stop perseverating on it.",

        "question": "why are only certain drum sounds counted when determining tempo of a drum track? let me explain. Lets say you have a bass drum (B) and a hi hat(H). If it goes HHBHHHBHHHB and so on thats a slower tempo than if the drum track is just BBBBBBBBB. For some reason the hi hats are more seen as something between the actual tempo than the tempo itself. I dont know if im explaining it well. Hopefully you understand.",
        "answer": "in general, i usually consider tempos from 60bpm to 120bpm. if it's outside that range you might double or halve it to get it within that range. but another thing usually considered is the snare, if there's a 'backbeat' you'd usually consider that 2 and 4, for example if you were at 110 bpm and your snare seems to be hitting on beat 3 only, you might re-consider the tempo to be 55, so that the snare is on 2 and 4. or if you're at 100bpm and your snare is happening on the \"&\" of every beat, then you might consider calling it 200 with the snare on 2 and 4. but it gets more confusing because many songs switch to half time or double time. which is where what i call the 'reasonability zone' of 60-120 comes into play. but it's more complicated still, for example in the last couple years i've been hearing a lot of songs with like a super halftime where the tempo is like 60, AND the snare is hitting on only 3. so if you went with the 2 and 4 theory then you'd be calling it 30bpm which is just not reasonable. it's just wherever you think the beat is. wherever you would tap your foot."

I'm also researching the possibility of studying in Sweden, their universities are fairly cheap to Europeans and they're ranked as good universities. Swedish is a pretty easy language to learn speaking English, too.

Right after hotewig you managed to do 4 songs in 4 weeks, and now you've spent a roughly 9 months doing 3 songs+video and 3 short videos. If your goal is to produce as many songs as possible, I think having an accompanying video is the wrong way to go. Don't get me wrong I enjoy every femtosecond of your videos but I'd be willing to forgo them if it meant more frequent songs",
        "answer": "yes, for now and get them heard that's what i thought too, in june 2017, but then after 4 songs i realized that the audience simply wasn't there. then i looked at the size of my youtube audience, and it was a no brainer. since then, i've done a video for every song, and it takes much longer, but the music audience (itunes, spotify, even radio) has grown much more since then and continues to steadily grow i'm considering striking a compromise of perhaps 1 to 1 alternation. but gosh darn the videos are effective. as they say, it's 1982, people hear with their eyes now"

        "question": "i am playing a lot - improvizating songs out - and i wonder if i should continue improvizing and get better in that or stop and finish some of the songs i improvized out? like record some instruments around or do a whole new song out of it which would sound less improvizational. how do you find the isudzwiuzdb between those options? what could you recommend me please? or ask me something",
        "answer": "keep your eligible song seeds in a list. chronologically by date born is usually the most helpful for me. writing is a different exercise from idea generation, and you basically just need a quiet place where you can do your work. once you're sure that you want to engage in the writing process, some important questions will be: choosing which song to work on, and how far to work on it. during 2012-2013 i had the insane idea that i was going to write just a bit on each one and move on. unfortunately this is not a strategy that will ever lead to completion (because there were hundreds of songs in there), and i worked like that for an entire year and didn't even get close to any kind of completion. (but the good news is i gained worlds of experience, and after that i felt i was a much much stronger writer). but finally i shuffled it up and organized them by percentage of completion and knocked off everything from the 70%s upwards (finishing the writing on those.) then of course you would have a whole other decision making process on which one(s) to record. Another strategy i've been using in more recent years is to make a selection from all the songs (finished or non) and stick with that and complete the writing and recording of that song. this is a good and focused strategy, but the downside is that it can be very hard to feel confident in the decision if none of the songs are beyond 20% written. i guess what i'm trying to say is there are many different strategies for choosing, but the one thing that i'm sure of which i'm trying to tell you is that the writing process is a separate process from idea generation, and you should log all your song seeds into a chronological list, and then go about making a decision on which ones to do and work on writing them. but if you haven't had too much experience in doing the actual 'writing', it might be good to just do a random selection or just go in order chronologically, just to see what goes into the whole writing thing. it's very different from improv/idea generation -- it's much more like being a doctor. you look into the original idea, you make a diagnosis, figure out what it is, where it's going, what it needs, brainstorm on what problems need to be solved, etc, and through hard thinking and trial and error, and a bit of imagination, you can find solutions. it can be grueling for the first few hours but once you have those sweet breakthroughs it can be liberating to know that you can take care of any 'song seed' and take it where it is trying to go. hopefully i've given you some information. as you can see i am still wrestling with some of this myself, mostly when it comes to the song selection strategies"

        "answer": "keep logging your ideas, but if you don't like them that much then perhaps you should keep improvising/generating new ideas until you get some that still look wild to you, even when you come back to them in the list. beware of what may happen, you will continue generating ideas and get better and better and soon you will have a list of 200 or 300 ideas which actually do drive you wild and you will realize it's impossible to complete all of them in anyone's lifetime"

Some quick research on the internet shows that sound bouncing off of objects other than the microphone is picked up by the microphone, causing small interference. I could email you an example of some staticky audio I've recorded if you'd like. Anyway, in high quality audio, such as yours, when there's silence it's actually silent, there's not a little buzz in the background that comes from \"sound bouncing off of other objects\". Apparently solutions are to either get a real high quality microphone, or to deck out the room with objects that sound doesn't bounce of, neither of which are in my budget. But you don't seem to have either of those either. So what do you do?",
        "answer": "that might be helpful don't be so sure you can make anything silent if you delete the part that's supposed to be silent the effect you are describing doesn't sound like it would be a result of that, but i would have to hear it to be sure you'd be surprised at what you can get away with"

        "question": "One of the few times I have ever experienced something truly different was at a concert a few years ago, when the person organizing everything told the audience beforehand that the foreign instruments we were about to hear would sound strange to our ears, but that they were supposed to sound like that. They weren't out of tune or anything, they were simply from a context where musical beauty is something else than it is here. There is so much out there, so many instruments, so many ways to make music, that all fall outside what \"we\" even think of as \"instruments\" and \"music\". It feels like an insult to the world when people within a certain context points at something and calls it new or different, when it's clearly derived. It is always derived. Never new, and never different. This is why your easy-going supposedly theory-defying persona on this page is so provoking. If you had the slightest idea of the kind of superhumanly free innovation everything you say on here is actually hinting to, you wouldn't be saying it, because you never do as you say you (aspire to) do. For example, you use the word \"anything\" a lot, as in \"do anything\" -- yet you basically make music by the book, music that is always somehow firmly rooted in the schools, traditions, rules and conventions of your culture, directly or indirectly. You may think otherwise, but in that case you are wrong. Making music and videos that tend to stand out somewhat in your own narrow sliver of cultural context is no way near actually embracing a theory that says \"you can do anything in music\". Cut the \"anything\" crap. It's grandiose and pathetic. You make great music, but your ambition put into (your own) words is some unreasonable hubris shit.",

        "question": "What does it mean when you say \"I-V\" or something like that in music? For instance, in the Wikipedia page fornicate 'Jazz turnarounds', I see stuff like I\u2013VI\u2013II\u2013V[4] (I\u2013V/ii\u2013V/V\u2013V) and V7/V\u2013V7\u2013I. Please explain; thank you in advance.",
        "answer": "i personally don't like to use roman numerals, because it looks very confusing and it's been a long time since ancient rome. but they're just numbers, for chords. so in the key of C, for example, 1 means C major chord. 2minor means D minor chord, 3minor means E minor chord, 4 means F major chord, 5 means G major chord, 6minor means A minor chord, and 7dim means B diminshed. sometimes lower case number automatically means minor, which i guess is the advantage of the roman numbers because you can use lowercase. but i prefer to just use arabic numbers (123 etc) and just say minor if it's minor. also when i use slash marks that means a different bass note but that doesn't quite make sense for the example you gave so i'm not sure how they are using slashes. also i usually use dashes - to mean minor, but i think in your example they are just being used to separate the chords. actually there are several things about your example that don't make sense to me, but they could be using a different system"

        "question": "This quote was on a music help website: \"So the best way to start learning to play chords by ear isn't to dive in and start trying it with songs. It's to learn about how chord progressions work and which chords are the most frequently used - then do some dedicated ear training to recognise just those chords. This approach lets you very quickly develop a very useful ability level with this skill.\" Do you agree with this?",
        "answer": "no. it's impossible for them to predict what music you are into. they might say 'these are the most common' but that's just from their perspective. everyone is living in a slightly different musical perspective, and has a slightly different comfort zone in terms of what music they are familiar with. i recommend learning the music you know. all music is good, and offers something to learn, and if you learn the music that made you like music, then everything is going to be fulfilling and meaningful"

I remember a while back you wrote that one of the ways that worked for your creative process involved consuming so much media or watching so many Other People's works that eventually you would EXPLODE with the desire to create when you couldn't take anymore! (I'm paraphrasing so if I got something wrong I'm sorry) I'm a little bit worried because along the way that I've been kinda following that idea, I've started unfortunately looking at things I once liked with a gross negativity that I can't shake off. I know that everyone is different and no advice works perfectly for everyone (it is as unique as the person) but I wanted to know if this was... \"normal\"? or that it might be an expected step? I hope that makes sense; it's been really weird and I'm a little scared that I might fall into a dark pessimism before bursting with creativity. If that's too weird or difficult to answer, I guess I want to ask if you've been through something similar and how you managed to BREAK OUT! and get the motivation to do something CRAZY to get out of that ugly negative rut. thank you",

        "question": "Do you agree with this analysis of \"hello sexy pants\"? \"This whole masterpiece is a analysis of late stage capitalism and its unnability to satisfy the alienated consumer it produce in the very negation of its production. What is the \"pants\" ? It's the commodified product par excellence, by owning the pants, you don't only own an object, you wear it and thus you make the object a part of your own identity, while you objectify yourself in the processus : at the end, the pants own you. That's how love work between humans, but that's also how it's manufactured in our spectacular society. As Baudrillard said \"seduction represent mastery over the symbolic universe while power represents only mastery over the real universe\" \"Where'd you get those pants ?\" said the cash cow : someone finally said that the king is naked. Indeed, where did those pants come from ? Isn't it the product of a bengali kid ? More deeply here relies a critiq ue of commodity fetishism : alienation make us forgot that we, as humans, are the producers of this pants; and just like the african tribes who forgot that they were the creators of their fetish, our production became our new god. No response to the quiet scream of the cow, just \"hello\", again and again. \"I wanna know why it hurts so bad\" : The ignorance of this alienation brings pain, we feel depossessed without understanding why, and when we see the pants we need to possess it badly by the act of consumption, since we don't feel that we own it by the act of production. We even have the feeling that the pants can \"make a wish come true\" : that's the final stage of the fetishised entity put above our heads. \"Hello sexy pants did you know that I like your pants ?\" : The commodity has become more than just pants. And in Congress all the boys get mad, and not because they oppose capitalism, bill wurtz is more subtile : the politicians are mad because they loose control over the system, they no longer have a word to say in the direction, just like everyone, they become simple executant of the will of the Capital. While nature is out there, represented by the squirrels, all we can see is the omnipresent modern propaganda of the media, in this TV everything looks fine and nice, there is happy faces everywhere and it tells us to be friends, but in reality it's divising humans, humans are no longer \"friends\", they are actors in the representation of a friendship mediated by the society of the spectacle, in wich being a friend is just a question of posture, of \"friendly stance\". And then the capital tell you that thanks to him you can go all around the world, and indeed it became \"easy as 1, 2\" to go through the hills of France : tourism - human circulation packaged for consumption, a by-product of the circulation of commodities - is the opportunity to go and see what has been banalized. The economic organization of travel to diffe rent places already guarantees their equivalence. The modernization that has reduced the time involved in traveling has simultaneously reduced the real space through which and to which one can travel. And, as Debord pointed it \"while eliminating geographical distance, this society produces a new internal distance in the form of spectacular separation.\" After that the TV subtly reminds you the danger in criticize our society : you are against us ? Do you want to live in North Korea ? However, the nature of the commodity reaffirm itself soon after, North Korea is - like any other places and activities - something that must be subjugated to the ever expanding market, we need to shake some hands even here, for business - and pleasure - since the two must become the same unique thing But there still is hope, We all could wake up in the morning and enjoying a simple yet meaningful life. But is this true liberation ? Isn't it a way to distract us from the true solution w ich must be collective ? Isn't this a pass to being lonely and to feel \"blue\" ? \"At the clothing store nobody tells you the whole world is changing\" : everything is said, capitalism don't tell you about the world it is making, you're here to buy as a mindless robot, you don't need to understand that the world is changing, in fact you mustn't; the world is changing by itself, by the forces of the Capital; and no one truly understand how : that's the ultimate \"proletarization\", proletarization in its essence is the privation of knowledges for a subject and the privation of a subject for knowledges, first we lose the ability to understand what we are producing, but in consequence we now lose the ability to understand what we are consuming, it's a vicious circle, the circle of the commodity. So buy your clothes and become your products, even if the clothes is always changing, seasons by seasons, we are not even able to see it, we are trapped in the phenomena wich do n't allo w us to see the noumena, the Capital instill in us the feeling that we are living in a never ending-present wich always existed and wich will always exist \"At the grocery store someone will tell you that what changed is you\" : that's the response of the Capital, it's not the world that is changing, it's you, you are the one who is not in phase with the perfect and immuable \"present\" of the spectacular society, so stop to complain and accept your fate, submit yourself to the system, learn it's rythm or accept that you are excluded from it; and why the grocery store ? Because the control of the spectacle is in the everyday life, in the most basic consumption. The pants are already forgotten, in this insatiable run for consumption, now we have a new fetish to love : the lamp, a lamp wich is so godly that it can \"light the whole darn sky\", but only \"at 2:pm\", never forget that everything is temporal in this world, and again, the Congress could do nothing against it, it c ould not even replicate the modern worship of the commodity, the light became black down there. Simon is probably the most interesting and intriguing character of this song, he is the double bipolarity of capitalism : he is the worker wich face its own alienation, without meaning in his work he can't \"remember anything he've been doing\", because of the economic functionnement of capitalism, and perhaps worse, because of the ideological functionnement of capitalism he can't remember \"anything he remember\", \"everything that was directly lived has moved away into a representation\" we don't live our own life, we live the life of the Capital by the Capital for the Capital, we are just actors of a stageplay wich was written before we were born, instead of being the actor of our own artwork, we don't have our own memories since we're just travelling from one representation to another. Represented by the graphics behind him, Simon is nothing but a number among other. And the grap hics also indicate us that Simon is also the financial world, the highest abstraction of the Capital, he don't know where he come from, he don't know who he is, is just here doing what he is made to. And there is the dramatical problem : They (the worker and the trader) don't care, as long as they find out what they're - supposed - to do. The \"supposed\" is the key to understand it fully, supposed according to who ? To what ? To the commodity, we don't think anymore, we don't put ourselves in an historical and ontogenetic approach, we are just here, doing what the God-Capital tell us to do, we become nothing more than a cog in a machinery that depass us all, that kill every bit of liberty in us. Simon IS the system, he is the one that tell us what to do, as showed by the use of \"Simon Says\", Simon wants to fully become us. He want us to become him. The reward ? A sign on your checks. Also, the lamp is very sexy.\"",

        "question": "Hi Bill, I have this really bad habit of starting really cool projects (at least, it seemed exciting stuff at the time), but then never finishing really any of them because they are displaced by new, current, in the moment things to think about and plan and try to do. It's like I forget how awesome the ideas felt to me when I came up with them. I've tried your strategy of just cateloging and recording every damn thing I think of, but I never end up going back to listen to them, and meanwhile I'm neck deepin something else that caught my attention, whether it's figuring out how the fuck math works, how the fuck computers work, how the fuck communication (e.g. talking politely, teaching) works, and also how the fuck the world works. realize of bad habits to have, this is definitely not the worst I could have. But it's just so fucking annoying when you are going to bed at 2 in the morning to wake up for school at 6:30 and you feel like you 've done nothing of substance, big and meaningful. Like I could be doing so much more, making the world just a little more cooler (I'd like to think), but just controlling the urge to swim deeper into the ocean even though you just dragged yourself out of the deep end is hard somehow. I can't shift from thinking \"But what? But why?\" to \"time to make shit.\" And really? I'm realizing that I'm okay with myself still humming a long, looking at and thinking about interesting stuff, because at the end of the day it is fun. But how exactly can I keep this up forever? This is fun, but I've kind of had the same kind of fun for a while now. Can I please just switch? I'm honestly kind of just insecure, because now I'm just thinking, do I even know what I'm saying right now? Is it really that big of a deal? Even when my thoughts are trying to say otherwise. There is a disconnect here between feelings and thought, and I'm not sure what is going on. And no, those were not th e good w ords to use there...that's not quite what I meant to say... I'm not sure if it's just sleep dep. making everything wobbly and unfocused, or my brain purposely trying not to think about this. I hate the feeling when I see both people that I follow online and people around me actually doing things, nd when other people around me are like \"dude just be lazy and stop caring so much\" IF I CARE SO MUCH WHY AM I GOING TO BED AT 3 JUST TO FINISH A GOD DAMN SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT well, let me take that back. I didn't start until 1, but I could have finished much earlier if I would have just half-assed it which would still have gotten me an A. And I was running away from starting it because I had no idea how to do it. I'm trying to learn Debussy's L'isle Joyeuse over the summer, attempting to make a karaoke track to \"and the day goes on\" with a DS soundfont I have, digitizing a Bible of sorts (not religious) with cool layout, pictures, and design, making a movie with my frie nd starring King Lear, and creating computer programs to help with scheduling. (There's a circle here somewhere...) Oh, and writing college essays. The sad thing is, there is more than enough time to do all this stuff, and more time to do more, during the summer. I know this. Everything would be great if I actually worked on it, instead I'm not. And I know the answer to this is that I'm on the right track, or that there is a tipping point. It's just so frustrating, and scary, because I don't know if I want to see myself if I ever go past that tipping point. I don't want to be boxed into everything. But I'm kind of wondering if I do need some sort of box to be able to continuously work on stuff. I can't think of really a whole project to finish in a day, like your schedule when you were starting. Sorry, this kinda like turned into many different issues. I can't even lay a finger on a specific problem I'm having. Hate to bother you with this, but it's jus t a big frustration for me that I haven't changed. Well, that's not true, I have changed a little, I'm looking at *literal* trash less often... Even if you don't reply, thanks for being an outlet for my thoughts. Sorry for this huge mess of a ramble, I'm also very tired, as I'm sure you are too. -IronLotus",
        "answer": "you are going through the exact same thing i went through for many years you will switch gradually, as your desire to switch continues to grow to firey new heights this is first hand proof that you are hard wired for success, beyond a shadow of a doubt. your ambitions are through the roof, and your standards are on the ceiling. and you think about it morning day and night, and in between classic i think you will find that the box is just going to be your name. you. i know it's tempting to live a thousand parallel creator's lives, but there's barely enough time to live 1. so i think an umbrella strategy might ultimately work best for you here. as soon as you get fully comfortable with the fact that you are mr. do-it-all, you can start treating yourself like a king and just plan the task sequence from there. that is why it is so vitally important to start very very short, small, and simple. there is a whole host of things that are learned AFTER you get your feet on the ground and doing things, that you never could have learned before. to sum it up into 2 points, first you will learn how far away actual real creations are from the vivid splendor you have imagined. but close on the heels of that is point 2 which is realizing how insanely much CAN be done, even just using the simplest tools available to you. learning happens fast from project to project, and the good news is, all your interests will find their way onto the menu. as long as you keep the train moving, you will surely hit all the stops and more. did i mention start small, trains are heavy"

        "question": "When it comes to learning to play an instrument, a reason why people tend to seek teachers is because there are several barriers that teachers help to break down. For example, you usually need short, easier songs to start with, so you can work your way up to the harder, more interesting songs, but simple songs (real simple, like I'm talking straight infantile) are usually more boring, thus less popular, and thus harder to find. Teachers help with this because over time they acquire tons of dead easy songs, hard songs, and the whole gradient between. Also, teachers provide a shortcut to valuable knowledge, like \"the more you do it, the better you get\" or \"start simple and work your way up\" or \"remember to take breaks\". In short, teachers are like grocery stores. Sure, you could go farm-to-farm trying to get what you need, but it's much easier to go to one source that is experienced in getting you what you need. Rebuttal?",
        "answer": "in my experience, the teacher student connection has never been strong enough for any of the good/important stuff to make the transfer. this is reconfirmed again and again every time i hear someone say \"i used to do music, i took lessons and i hated it and quit.\" added to all the great players out there who are self taught. advice can surely be transfered from one person to another, but it seems it mostly works on a non-teacher basis, not scheduled. for example you find a player you really really like and you check out all their stuff. or maybe there is someone you trust and you can ask them questions about certain things. i don't know if that counts as teaching but that works really well and i try to make that happen on the questions page as much as possible. although sometimes, my best answer is not something they are ready to hear at the time, or maybe they just aren't interested in doing the same way as me, which is ok, but it would get very awkward if someone was paying for us to have required meetings each week and pretend we were getting somewhere"

        "question": "people are having trouble with the audio when they listen with vs without headphones?? I've never had that problem when I listen to your music. I can hear all of the audio just fine.",
        "answer": "if you listen to it through a phone speaker, tablet speaker, or laptop speaker, you can't hear any of the bass, or any of the low frequencies whatsoever. it's just not there. it's physically impossible on a speaker of that size. any normal sized speaker would be just fine, but on a speaker less than 1cm, mostly what you hear is a lot of S and T, and the hi-hat, and maybe a little more if you listen close, but zero bass. which is why i think i would like to start the recording of my next song without any bass frequencies, just to make sure i get the thing so that i think it's strong enough even with zero bass. Then, go in and add bass as needed, for bass-capable systems. but first make sure it completely stands strong with no bass. we all know it's possible, like i said, they made music for game boy and it was damn good. and when i say gameboy i mean also millions of phone apps, and ringtones, that have been popular since then. but if you design the whole song on a system where you can hear the bass, you're taking a risk, because you never know if the song is still gonna be strong enough if you delete the entire bass. i've taken that risk for my entire career because i'm mostly too scared to think about it. but i think it's a good time to try to take care of it because phone/tablet speakers aren't going to get any larger, and there is no technological breakthrough any time soon that will allow bass to exist at that size. but don't worry, i will go into bass mode and additively put the bass where it needs be, after i get it so it is solid basslessly"

I do in fact start it, however I just stop in the middle of making it and never finish it. Sometimes I even think of a new project that I want to make and completely scrap the old one. Then I get stuck in a loop of half-doing projects. A third of my computer are now WIP projects that I'm never going to finish. It's quite horrible, but I never really delete them because I think to myself \"I'll do it once. I'll finish all of them\". I never do, and I just continue filling my computer with half-done projects. Is there a way for me to stop doing this? I haven't finished a single project for many months, even though I want to do it.",
        "answer": "do data backups and make sure they are all saved. there is very little that is stopping you from developing the skill of rescuing. you could start by getting a text file and making a chronological list of all of them, with brief notes on what you think they need for the next step. be open to the possibility of item cancellation at this stage, but expect most of them to not be cancelled"

        "question": "Bill, i've been playing the piano for months, i listen to the songs i enjoy and i learn to play them by ear. I'm good at finding out the melody or the lead vocal's notes, but i'm having troubles identifying the chords and extra stuff other than the melody. what do you suggest me to do? i started to become familiar with the sounds of some of the chords i use a lot (A,Am, Em, F , Fm, Bb, C D G etc.) . Do i just listen and play more?",
        "answer": "a good starting trick is to pause the music and then unpause-pause very quickly. this might not work on a streaming site like youtube, but it will would very well on an offline player. when i was a kid i used to do it with a CD player. if you just listen to that micro-second of the song, you can pick out 1 note at a time. write down all the chords to a song (in time, with bar lines, etc.)..... once you do this for about 30 or 40 songs, i think you will find that you don't have to search for the individual notes anymore. ... maybe not even pause it at all. After about 100 more songs, you probably won't even have to listen to the song, you will be able to do it from memory. after about 1000 songs, you will probably be able to hear someone singing the melody for a song you have never heard before, without hearing the chords, and figure out what the chords should be. after 10,000 songs, you should be able to play along with them on the first try, never having heard the song before, and have them think you already knew the song"

        "question": "How do you think Mr. Rogers and Costa would coordinate the music for the show? Not the songs themselves, but all the background music.. The music always seemed to follow Mr. Rogers' vocal delivery and timing and pauses so perfectly. Like, do you think they would they just tape the show without music and Costa would do his thing? Or do you think there had to some coordination for timing and stuff? I wanna try to do some \"spoken word\" stuff with music accompaniment, but not sure if it's better to just record the speaking naturally or to do the music first, or try to do both simultaneously, etc.. it just blows my mind how perfect the music was in that show. I've tried to do it but I can't get the timing and flow of the speaking and music to blend so nicely like Rogers and Costa.",
        "answer": "it was done live. costa is surely just improvising the underscoring. this kind of thing gets better and better and better and better over time. and they did thousands of shows"

        "question": "So, say you have a note that goes til the end of a beat, and then a note right at the top of the next beat (like a quarter note on beat 1, then a quarter note on beat 2).. Wouldn't that mean that, technically, that first note shouldn't be released until the exact same moment that the 2nd note is played? If you have to lift up from the 1st note to play the 2nd note, then wouldn't you be cutting the duration of the the quarter note slightly short just for that little tiny moment between the notes? Is that little moment so negligible that I shouldn't even think about that? And then, the natural sustain of the instrument/sound could effect that as well? Like sometimes it would be impossible to sustain the first note until the exact moment the 2nd note is played (like if you're playing 2 fretted notes on the same string of a guitar or bass that are farther apart than what you can reach without moving your hand)... If I want to have 2 instruments play the same line, would it be more accurate to think of that 1st quarter note as, like a dotted eighth note and a sixteenth rest (or maybe even an eighth note, dotted sixteenth and a 32nd rest) so that the release of the notes happen at the exact same time? I've never really thought about this before, but now that I am thinking about it, I'm confusing myself. When I read rhythmic notation I'm usually thinking primarily about where the notes hit, more so than the duration of each note. Like if I had 4 quarter notes, I'd now that each note should be played on the beat, but I'd probably play the 4 quarter notes no different than then if it were written as alternating dotted eighth notes and sixteenth rests (unless it's a really slow tempo) Obviously for something like a quarter note and a quarter rest, I wouldn't play the same way as a half note.. but when you get down to those little itty bitty tiny moments in between the notes, do those essentially not matter rhythmically?",
        "answer": "if no articulation is written, i think it might be assumed that there is at least a little bit of space before the next note"

        "question": "I've taken theory III and I still don't understand tritone substitution can you explain it to me",
        "answer": "imagine you are in a song, minding your own business, ... let's say the song is in the key of C ... and let's say there is a G7 chord. .. following me so far? the G7 chord has notes b and f in the mid-range, that's the important notes of the chord. (that's a tritone interval but that's not why it's called substitution, we haven't done the substitution yet, that will be in the bass.) so let's say you play b and f notes (at the same time) in the middle range, and the bass plays G (note.) that pretty much makes a G7 chord. ok now the bass player plays a prank and plays Db (note) instead, while the piano still plays the b+f notes. pow, now it's a Db7 chord"

Do you think this is a way we can visualize 4D objects in the 3D plane? Like for a 4D tuning fork, there are 2 spheres, but as you move through the 4th spatial dimension the spheres eventually come together as into a pill-shaped rod and then combine into 1 sphere, and vice versa if you go backwards?",

Why do you think these kinds of virtuosic abilities develop in certain people - many of whom might not even be able to, for example, sight read or understand the underlying textbook music theory behind why their music \"works\" so well the way it does?",
        "answer": "that might be because music came first (before the university) perhaps they have developed a stronger understanding of the theory than the textbook, by cutting out the middle man, which in this case may be the text book"

        "question": "i have a sweet hook that i've fleshed out to a whole chorus-y section, but every time i try to write the rest of the song i just come up with more hooks and other lines that belong in different songs. have you encountered this and if so do u have any strategies",
        "answer": "yes this might take patience. it is like a doctor's diagnosis, you are the doctor. and you need to figure out how to take care of this piece. this task can be confusing and requires patience, but it can be done. it's usually just a long game of \"what do we know\" and asking many questions and eventually you will figure out what the solution is. if you test things categorically you can eliminate things instantly and narrow it down pretty swiftly. there are many questions you could ask, but i will try to list some of the questions that i usually ask. 1. does it seem to want to stay in the same form (same chords, same form, etc. same thing) for the 'other section.' some songs absolutely need that, and some songs are absolutely allergic to it. just doing a simple test and listen to whether it makes you extremely happy or uncomfortable, should be pretty easy to answer that one. another thing you might look at is lyrical content. another important tip, i heard a rumor that dave grohl gave this advice once, and the advice is called \"get to the chorus\"... like don't waste any freakin time if you don't have to. here's an interesting thing to check for: could you actually start with the chorus. in some cases this is just right, in some cases it's all wrong. a simple test should prove that one way or the other. here's a neat trick, do a regular run-thru of the chorus and figure out what wants to go Next. if that works then you could get your 'other section' from there. then you would be on to a different question which is which goes first and how. another strategy which is similar to one of the ones i already said, remember that the point of this whole thing is the part that you know already. the part that exists (the chorus, in this case). so just focus on that. that's the point of this whole thing. so maybe even start bargaining for that to be really the only part of the song in the entire song. and then just see how wrong that is and make adjustments from there. here's another thing to check for, starting with the chorus and then do another chorus with different lyrics, etc. i'm sure you've heard a million songs that are like that. that's often just the ticket if you have a strong chorus that seems to be the star of the show. those are just some things to check for, over all this is going to be a puzzle but if you are gentle with it the answer will arrive. if the part you already wrote is great then it is guaranteed that there is a solution. also i almost forgot to mention, if you come up with extraneous things that are good but don't fit, always log those (separately)"

He was all like \"you know, it's so great to see a young person who likes REAL music and not all that crap you hear on the radio today... Hip hop and rap and pop aren't music... etc etc etc\" And this guy's so happy that he met someone (me) who he can \"nerd out\" with and gush about all of his favorite music and stuff.... But, how can I tell this guy that just because I like some of that \"classic rock\" stuff, doesn't mean that I don't also like the music I hear on the radio today, and (even though I don't like genres) most of the music in listen to probably wouldn't be called \"rock\" by most people. I feel I've reached the point of no return and it's too late for me to admit that I like a lot of the music he loves hating on. I'm fine talking about the bands we both like, but I get really uncomfortable when the conversation turns to bash ing mode rn artists and non-rock music. And he always tries to rope me into talking about hating music that's not rock music from the 60s and 70s.",

        "question": "you mentioned a couple times that you have made decisions about what to do next based on some kind of \"tournament\" format. do you have any tips for how to do this effectively or things you've learned from doing it. like, what rules do you make the decisions follow, what will get them disqualified for cheating and so forth. I might be doing this soon",
        "answer": "what i've developed is a hybrid system between sheer number randomization and actually choosing. actually choosing can be impossible, especially if you are terrified of picking the wrong one. sheer randomization works on the idea that there could not possibly be any right or wrong one and it doesn't matter. the hybrid system goes like this: make preliminary exclusions for various reasons, and then randomize amongst the finalists. Start by listing all the items. go through them all, and it is very important that you fully and truly check out every one, go find the source material, find your notes, find the demos, whatever you have, but don't just go based on the title or memory. at least half the time the song turns out better than you remember it, if you actually go and listen to it. then start excluding ones you absolutely know should not be picked, and it should be only for very specific reasons. usually these reasons would be in direct relation to the most recent song(s) i released. for example, last year i released a song called california, then a song called i love you. when choosing for the next song, a song called \"california love\" might be a bad choice. other common exclusion reasons are if the tempo or groove is too similar to the previous song. So i go through the entire list and make exclusions. which should be minimal but recently i've become extremely particular and exclude almost everything, which is getting back to the original problem with manual 'conscious' picking (and the problem is \"being a chicken\"). i would be discouraged by this, but, the good news is, every time there are at least a few songs that absolutely jump out at me and scream yes. so i guess this is ok but one thing that complicates this system is that more complete (written) songs tend to be more obvious choices. where as songs which only have 1 line written tend to not be as strong a contender as perhaps they should be. especially because i would get to write the majority of it brand new if it were picked, likely enabling it to be an even stronger pick. randomization boosts those small bits' chances of being picked, but doing pre-elimination often wipes out many of those. this also brings up an interesting point about doing this ONLY with finished (written) songs, vs including all fragments. in the past 2 years i've done it where i include all fragments, because the fragments are usually newer, and stronger, (newer because they would be less likely to have been finished yet, and stronger because they are newer, and even stronger because i get to finish them in the present time). but the drawback for including bits is like i said they often have trouble competing with more complete ones. so for this reason it is important to be extra specific in your exclusion reasons, vividly explaining to yourself the reason. (too similar to last song, etc.). and \"too unwritten yet\" is not a valid excuse, and that's almost a great reason to keep it. this is why randomization helps, because it will boost the chances for those bits which were too small to demand being picked, but yet not excludable for any specific reason. which essentially allows you to write a mostly entirely new song, and make it good on demand, because it's already been selected as the next one to record. so once you have it down to finalists, sometimes i go through again because i am usually so darn scared to pick the wrong one, probably because to fully produce a song and an entire video by yourself with rising standards takes a very long time so i am very scared to be stuck with the wrong one. so sometimes i go through the list and comb it down again, but it's probably bad to do that too much because you end up wiping out all the tiny fragments. finally when you have maybe 20-40 finalists, then just a simple random number selection (from random.org, for example) will pick for you, and if you did your exclusions properly you will hopefully never run into a wrong pick ('really?? another marijuana song?')"

I'm responsible for the vocals, and have as of now composed about 75% of the vocal melodies. But I have no idea what to do about lyrics. Long story short, I only have 2 weekends, 3 weekends max to write lyrics, finish writing vocal melodies, and record the vocal parts. I've tried in vain to get a jump start on the lyrics but I feel absolutely stuck. I don't want to vomit out nonsense filler words (this will likely be the last thing my band ever records/releases, as I am moving across the ocean next month). I just can't seem to generate anything remotely meaningful. And I want it to be. Have you struggled with writing lyrics you were happy with? Any suggestions?",

        "question": "You've mentioned that you don't want to make money from what you do. At least- you don't want that to be your main motivation. It seems that your main motivation is to make what you want to create and express yourself in the way that makes you happy. And I'd love to do the same thing. I'm not old enough to have a job. I'm still in high school. So my question is how can I make my life and my art central around my happiness and drive and not be worried about making money from it? I don't enjoy working for others or being told how to do something and I wonder how I'm going to financially sustain myself in the future and continue making my art. I'd really appreciate if you answer this. Thank you! You're the best! :)",
        "answer": "that's absolutely not true that's absolutely true to eliminate the financial pressure from your main activities, you'll want to get a completely separate job. it could be completely entirely different, or maybe you might discover a way to somehow use some of your art skills to help with getting a job, only if that helps you get a better job. but don't be fooled, this is still separate. the key is separation. UNLESS you want to take the alternate route which most people recommend which is to actually try to combine the two, and depending on what kind of person you are, that may or may not ruin everything"

But the way my own creativity is wired, writing lyrics and music at the same time would be like writing ambidextrously in two different languages at once. For a long time, as a songwriter/composer/alien/etc I saw my lyrics as simply a vessel for the vocal melody, and resented the the listeners' inevitable search Deeper Meaning where there wasn't any. I've ultimately decided that's a cowardly way to go about things, so now I'm stuck. Meaningful words don't come to me through the ether in the same way that music does.",

I thought one of the main story arcs in your personal narrative is gathering the courage to murder this cowardly version of yourself so that you can finally be free to explore and explode the universe the way you're meant to. But I guess he wasn't dead, because when I arrived at your door holding a new set of mysterious keys, that guy opened the door just long enough to slam it back in my face and yell at me for disturbing your slumber. Talk about frustrating, sad, and not very nice. 3) https://billwurtz.com/reality/201201081536.mp4 But I'll still raise a toast to the version of you that might still be alive somewhere... the version of you that might still have it in him to burn that stubborn little bitch's clothes off once and for all. There's a lot of new doors for you to open and a lot of new rooms for you to explore in this life and I'd hate for you to delay your journey any longer than you already have.

        "answer": "so far i'm doing great, although everyone feels afraid from time to time everyone has doubts sometimes. it's a part of everyone i'm not sure what you mean but i know who this is because you've been sending me a long string of messages for several months now with a deep obsession with my past (which is ok) but from the start you had a deep certainty that you were somehow my soul mate and that i was meant to be with you. you probably sent me at least 500 messages like this before i even responded to any of them. and when i finally told you to please leave me alone, the messages continued but mostly took a more negative turn. many of the messages have been sexual in nature, and most of them make no secret of spending countless hours deeply analyzing everything i have ever done, which is fine, but the nature of the messages is more than several steps over the line into the stalker creepy zone. i wish i could properly explain this for people who have not seen the types of messages you have sent me. obsessing over people is great and fine, i'm not saying obsession is bad, i used to act out mr. roger's opening routine verbatim hundreds of times a day. i don't want anyone to misunderstand what i'm saying here. obsession is fine, but what you have done beyond that is send me a never ending stream of messages presuming that you are destined to be with me in every way including romantically. it would be difficult for anyone reading this to understand the nature of this because they have not seen the messages. but i was uncomfortable after about the 50th message, ever since you started sending me loads of messages every day insisting you are my soul mate, looking forward to having sex with me, that sort of thing. all before you ever got a response from me. sure i believe in soul mates, sure i believe in supernatural stuff, sure i believe in the magic of this universe, but you're stalking me and it's turned into harassment. i don't like it and i never liked it, i've tried to tell you to stop, i don't think you're going to, that's ok, i still don't like it, but i don't think i can count on you stopping, i am wondering if you will stop, but i just need to let you know that you are really being a creep here and you have been for a long time, and i wish you would stop trying to blame me for not being 'open to the world' when really it's simply that i am not open to being .. . .. for lack of a more eloquent term .. ... .... stalked and creeped upon. that's all i have to say and i don't like having to post this publicly and i realize most people reading this have not seen all the messages you've sent me so they couldn't possibly know the extent and sheer magnitude and nature of the messages you have sent me but i just need to express this here because you seem to have no intention of ever stopping"

        "question": "butt poop fart butt fart fart fart i need to write more but i also need to draw more and sing more and touch the piano more and i Really need to start making videos but i also Really need to start coding but i also REALLY need to commit my life to developing the technology to telepathically link all human minds oh and i need to quit neglecting math and while i'm at it develop every other known skill including the skill of learning to know the as-yet unknown skills but life is short... ... ... ... ... ... and here i sit in the floor of my nasty-ass room as it drains away. on my stupid fucking phone. again. every night. drip. drip. drip. drip. drip. drip. 123123onetwothreeimnotfree how do i fit all the pieces together without the pieces all sucking? i guess i know. one piece has to be king. but every Useful thing i latched onto early in life i was slapped away from. so i am underdeveloped and afraid and insecure but somehow also very egotistical. maybe my ego will save me but maybe it'll just make me grosser. i can feel it shriveling up the longer i sit on my ass. i could have been so fucking happy. i could be. maybe. oh fuck i'm doing that thing again where i start with a nothing-phrase because i want to send something but don't have a real question in mind, i just want to be heard and acknowledged, and my feelings all leak out in this lazy-crazy-rambly way but i'm just talking to myself and it just keeps going and going until it's beyond unanswerable and maybe it's also lame and embarrassing there's a nifty new word for that that i fucking hate but only because it applies to the vast majority of my actions (((Cringy))) and then when i realize it's reached the point of being an unanswerable wall of manic cognitive behavioral diarrhea i go on for a few dozen more lines in which i acknowledge this and then i have to decide whether to send it in or save it in my notes and spare you the pain and then i remember that the not-punctuating thing had gotten old. this makes me want to stop sending anything in ever, because frankly i'm being fucking ridiculous. but it's hard to get the words out when you know no one is going to see them. but it's also easy. maybe when i do this i'm in a blended state of that. i start off trying to talk to someone real, but when i think about that, i feel like i'm being fake, so i try to let go of the worry of how it seems and say what i really need to, which turns into just talking to myself. that's the only way i have known how to communicate what i really mean. no one has been there to listen. it's hard to communicate with others on a true level when 99% of your communication is to yourself in the dry echo chamber of your personal language. try to pour the steaming hot crazy into a mold of understandable meaning and the mold melts into it. it's hard to remember what makes sense to other people if you don't talk to other people and you forget what makes sense in the context of you having thought about it at every different angle for hundreds of hours, and then you try to explain it based on the conclusions that you made a long time ago that you forgot were conclusions that are contingent on a lot of thinking that the other person has not done and cannot understand unless you guide them through that. but it was a long, messy process that you keep forgetting and remembering infinitely. but if you try to fit it into what you know about The World Outside Your Mind, you might find that the things you say aren't necessarily what you mean but things that you've heard that sound like they make sense and, stringed together, sound like what a person could really be thinking, and that person might be able to understand it, but it feels as if you just tried to make it make sense at the expense of it not matching what you're feeling. because the only way to explain how you're really feeling is to use the language that only you can speak. which doesn't make sense to anyone but you. and you can't exactly figure out the difference and oh my god how did i get on this tangent the point is i am talking to myself because i need to talk to someone but i am not capable of explaining myself in person. writing works when you uh i dunno edit it from this steaming pile of word vomit but when i write something that is intended to be edited and made presentable i am paralyzed and won't stand to type a single sentence that isn't absolutely perfect even though that's not how writing works writing is rewriting but i get so hung up on everything and i just can't get anything out certainly nothing that i really mean because i keep thinking AHH HOW IS THIS ALL GONNA FIT TOGETHER DOES THIS MAKE SENSE DOES THAT FLOW NATURALLY IS IT EVEN NECESSARY OR TOO TRITE OR TOO FLOWERY OR DOES THIS PHRASE THAT SEEMS NICE TRULY MATCH WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY OR DOES IT SEEM TO MAKE SENSE CONSIDERINF THE REST BUT IS ACTUALLY SOME SORT OF FILLER IN DISGUISE so that's what it is i am letting the thoughts flow out but you need to REVISE MOTHERFUCKER i could totally do that but then i worry if there's any point or if i'm going to kill the spirit of the whole thing in trying to fit it into a presentable shape but it's probably fine the point is to make it understandable you're just being a lazy narcissist a good writer doesn't write exactly how everything appears in their head not when the point is for anyone else to follow and understand what you're doing is different it's a good exercise but this is no end product the problem is you are subjecting someone else to that and you could fix it up into something to be shipped to stores but is that going to pay off? will you feel good about yourself if you spent days working this out into a complete and well-formed Thing if still the intended recipient (hi, i didn't forget about you, i swear) reads it and just goes \"what the fuck\" and moves on? this is pretty lazy and selfish but i don't know what to do anymore i'm insane i guess sorry i forgot to apply deodorant today",
        "answer": "ah #relatable every way to fit pieces can be good and bad at the same time. the judges will give them a unique score every time, depending on the weather. what i'm saying is get out there and put those pieces in different ways and then later someone else can be jealous of how good they thought you did it, just as you've felt for the way someone else did it before it sounds like you have a lot of free time which is very very useful and some people have had that slapped away but it sounds like you still have yours when feelings are what actually makes the most sense. all the test market research and focus groups will confirm this that's not true. if you are speaking real feelings you could be speaking in hot lava and people will still get it exactly. the heat will be unmistakable hot unpresentable garbage is surprisingly understandable, and it has a magnetic and irresistible quality to it which causes people to pay more attention to it and therefore understand it if you don't do that then how are you going to know what you're doing not if it didn't contain any protein have you ever had an irresistibly fun time on the page? that's the kind of stuff we're looking for here. that's really the thrill everyone was looking for you can do it tomorrow"
